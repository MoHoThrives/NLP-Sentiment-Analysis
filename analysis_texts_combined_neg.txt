in los angeles , the alcoholic and lazy hank chinaski ( matt dillon ) performs a wide range of non-qualified functions just to get enough money to drink and gamble in horse races . his primary and only objective is writing and having sexy with dirty women . 

 " factotum " is an uninteresting , pointless and extremely boring movie about an irresponsible drunken vagrant that works a couple of days or weeks just to get enough money to buy spirits and gamble , being immediately fired due to his reckless behavior . in accordance with imdb , this character would be the fictional alter-ego of the author charles bukowski , and based on this story , i will certainly never read any of his novels . honestly , if the viewer likes this theme of alcoholic couples , better off watching the touching and heartbreaking hector babenco ' s " ironweed " or marco ferreri ' s " storie di ordinaria follia " that is based on the life of the same writer . my vote is four . 

title ( brazil ) : " factotum Â sem destino " ( " factotum Â without destiny " )  respected western auteur budd boetticher is woefully out of place with this choppy modern day cops and robbers story that suffers from a strong lack of emotional believability . boetticher seems to have waived rehearsal time and settled for the first take as leads joe cotton and rhonda fleming put little effort into their roles , delivering lines flatly and without energy . 

mild mannered employee leon " foggy " poole works as an inside man on a bank job that goes bad and gets his wife killed in the process . he escapes from prison and immediately sets out to kill the wife of the detective who killed his . hundreds of cops are mobilized to keep him from getting to the home of the intended who has been moved to another location but wouldn ' t you know in the films final moments we have foggy trailing feet behind the victim ( who thought somehow that taking a bus back to the house was a sound move ) while a company of cops observe and bicker over what action to take . sound preposterous ? you should see it . it ' s all of that and more . 

lucien ballard ' s camera work does a decent job of bringing noir to the suburbs but the editing is lackadaisical and shapeless and it drains the film of its suspense and pace . as poole , wendell corey is the best thing in the film managing to evoke great sympathy as he transitions from gentle soul to murderer . these attributes aside killer uniformly fails in construction and execution making its message clear . go western old budd .  1821_4.txt has a higher probability for the negative label: -1180.5791543501045

 the affair is a very bad tv movie from the 1970s starring the then-husband-wife team of robert wagner and natalie wood as hesitant lovers . she has polio and leads a reclusive existence as a pop song writer . he ' s an ambitious lawyer who is very outgoing and absolutely smitten with her . their affair , such as it is , is doomed from the start , and she knows it , but goes along with it anyway . two things to watch for if you are trapped into watching this : wood ' s jane fonda hairdo that is never mussed , no matter what , and a tune she sings early in this dreadful flick . she sings it for four or five or six minutes , so you know it ' s classic padding between commercials . it also is one of the worst songs ever written , and the woman doing wood ' s singing voice should have been shot and put out of her misery . also , keep an eye out for all the peasant tops and dresses . by comparison , wagner looks relatively timeless , with close-cropped hair and sporting a series of classic suits .  after the general , a film that romanticized the life of dublin gangster the general to such heroic proportions that it made the average dublin person sick , along come kevin and his attempted portrayal of mr . lynch or martin cahill , aka the general , the acting is so bad that this crime drama becomes a comedy for the native dub , and a tragedy for the kevin spacey fan . in short , is the movie worth a look . . . . no , unless u like bad acting with hilarious ' proper irish accents , ah sure to be sure to be sure ' . the story is ripped off from the commercially successful ' the general ' which , despite is glorification of a well known dublin animal in martin cahill is still worth a look , on a domestic scale because it shows real working class dublin , and on an international scale because of he true irish acting and killer cast , including john voight . all in all , ' ordinary decent criminal ' is anything but a decent film . avoid .  i am surprised that so many comments about this film are positive . having read the book several times ( and all the other historical novels by mika waltari ) there is no way to say much good in this film . if i forget the origins of the story i might consider it a reasonably good epic . of course to bring such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task not to be envied , but it could be done with class . i can ' t understand why even the name of nefernefernefer had to be shortened to just nefer . i love peter ustinov as kaptah and marlon brando probably would have made a better sinuhe but the overall attitude is too hollywood to ever make justice to the book . mind you mika waltari left the premier of this film in the middle of the showing . that ' s how much he liked it .  cronica de un desayuno combines the worst defects of mexican cinema , a rare feat nowadays . 

it ' s pretentious : it wants us to believe that it is deep , only because some scene is out-of-focus , another is pseudo-surreal , yet another plays with the eisenstein-infante-caifanes tradition of laughing-crying faces , the edition is fragmented , and it is all so solemn . 

it has a weak script : the main story hardly develops , so it has other three smaller , needless stories , stuck into it . they are only good to make the film last longer . 

most of the acting is bad . a true feat , baring in mind that many of the best known mexican actors were cast . 

there is an abuse of unnecesary foul language . to the point that the character of paloma , who symbolizes the dreams of freedom of a child , uses it throughly . 

it is homophobic . the character played by eduardo palomo is the sorriest , and most punished , representation of a transexual i have ever seen . 

it is very boring . i ended up envying the people that left the theater before the end of the film . 

whatever it tries , it has been done better , in mexico and elsewhere . 

in other words : " para partirte la madre , nada como una mala pelÃ­cula "  big d . b . tries to keep peace between the settlers and their red brothers . 

boone ( an aging bruce bennett ) has to try and prove to the local indian chief ( lon chaney , jr . , appearing to be drunk , as usual ) that his son was killed by the tribe ' s leading jerk who has also been dealing in rifle-trafficking when nobody ' s looking . faron young sings , though he holds his rifle like it ' s a mop . 

ok western-adventure directed by two guys , neither of whom has many credits on his resume , but this flick ain ' t too bad and it has a nice short running time of 76 minutes .   " the duke " is a film based in the heart of the british aristocracy where an old duke ( john neville ) dies and to avoid his large property and the vast riches to be taken from him after death by 2 devious aristocrats ( oliver muirhead and sophie heyman ) ; he passes his dukeship down to his dog . the dog ' s " best friend " , an american girl named charlotte ( played by courtnee draper ) whose parents die becomes orphaned by the former duke due to him being her great uncle . a young chef named florian arrives , with him and charlotte instantly connecting creating a romantic sub-plot which in its own way , acts as the under tone for the main plot line being the activities of hubert , the ' duke ' and his many activities and love interests with other dogs . all this is watched over by james doohan who plays a butler who is determined to try and serve his old duke by doing his best to serve his new master , hubert . doohan acts as the older character there to comfort and advise the younger ones whilst he over looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master . a fine comedic performance mixed with elements of drama to end the career of a fine and influential actor . 

though from the technical viewpoint , i dislike this film as i only watched upon discovering james doohan ' s role . though the plot is good , elements of the writing and directing have to be obscured . ignoring the absurdity of a " doggie duke " , i personally dislike the over use of comedic and outrageous jokes upon the ' bad ' characters due to their ludicrousness . the dependence on hygiene related humour as you like is much too apparent and general silliness of many characters doesn ' t appeal to me . the director , phillip spink uses mid-long shots too often with either an overdubbed voice or affecting the overall sound quality . plus , the acting of muirhead and heyman , whilst good at the dramatic and romantic sequences , fall drastically short fulfilling the wholesale requirements regarding the role . 

but , as a mature movie fan , i find it easy to be over critical of a simple family film designed to make you laugh . i can admit i found certain bits funny and other bits touching along with a plot that may be far-fetched , but has definite connections . i do not recommend this film to mature movie fans but i do highly recommend it to dog lovers , families who wish to enjoy a funny film for their child and james doohan fans who wish to see ' scotty ' in his final role .  in the 3rd installment of " left behind " the makers did not care to put any kind of continuity into the plot . although all weapons on the planet have been confiscated by the united nations , world war iii suddenly begins at the snap of a finger . within a few split-seconds the ex-lover of one of the main protagonists moves from passionately seducing him to outright hatred to a melancholy confession of love without any trace of direction . 

but foremost this film is really an irony-free zone . after the president of the united states accepts jesus as his savior he immediately becomes a suicide bomber and blows up a skyscraper in the middle of the city . osama bin laden will be very jealous when he sees this film !  nice movie and nicholle tom does a fantastic job playing the " guy in the girl ' s body " , she really does it well . 

a sort of teen version of many other movies , but well done . 

well casted , from " matt " to " matt2 " .  based on a stephen king novel , needful things provides the intrigue and eeriness to keep you in your seat . a mysterious man ( max von sydow ) comes to town and soon becomes the most talked about citizen . could it be that the devil himself has set up shop as an antique dealer in a small town in maine ? von sydow is masterful and dynamic in this role that dominates the screen . also starring are ed harris and bonnie bedelia . harris is steady and bedelia is deserving of your attention . also in support are j . t . walsh and amanda plummer . not the best , nor the worst adaptation of king ' s horror on the screen .  it ' s unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy ( but scratchy ) background score that accompanies this 1933 release . although sound came into general use in 1928 , there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman , unhappily married , who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods . 

the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town , proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife ' s lover . in a frenzy of jealousy , he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment , losing his nerve . it ' s probably the most tension-filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow-moving and obviously contrived story . 

hedy lamarr is given the sort of close-up treatment lavished on marlene dietrich by her discoverer , but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to hollywood . her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love ( aribert mog ) , the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim . 

the swimming scene is very brief , discreetly photographed , and not worth all the heat it apparently generated . the love-making scene , later on , is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film--artfully so . more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism--and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece . 

not so . it ' s disappointing , primitively crude in its sound portions ( including the laborious symphonic music in the background ) and certainly miss lamarr is fortunate that louis b . mayer saw the film and on the basis of it , gave her a career in hollywood . he must have seen something in her work that i didn ' t . 

it ' s apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work . the jarring " workers " scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed . it fails to end the film on the proper note .  acclaimed argentine horror director emilio vierya directs a script from jack curtis and antonio ross . cheesy and ridiculous are in the mix for the method to the madness . a doctor ' s son is nearing his early death , until his desperate father transplants an ape ' s heart into his chest . as expected , things are going to get weird ; when this young man turns into a mask wearing monster and roams the beaches scouting out nice looking party girls to make his slaves . when heroin is injected , his beauties become zombies . the monster summons his dazed minions with strange organ music . so bad . . . well . . . it ' s just bad . in the cast : jose e . moreno , alberto caneau , mauricio de ferraris , gloria prat and gina moret .  robert lansing plays a scientist experimenting with passing objects through solid matter , but he goes too far one night and unintentionally makes himself four-dimensional ! atomic-age fantasy is rather charming in a very cheesy way . perhaps it was considered a thoughtful sci-fi in its time ( with psychological overtones ) , yet seen today the film is mildly overbaked and naive ; it ' s a camp-fest tailor-made for tv ' s late-late show . wooden performances by lansing and lee meriwether barely rate as one-dimensional , though patty duke ( playing a cute brat pre- " miracle worker " ) gets a colorful , memorable exit . 

 * * from * * * *  yes , it might be not historically accurate ( actually only 6 soldiers of 9th rota were killed there ) , and yes , it has some mistakes and exaggeration ( bended machine gun ? come on ! or the that " history lesson " about how afghanistan was never conquered by anyone - educated russian officer would know history much better than that - take for example british campaign in afghanistan ) . and yes , it does not have multi-million dollars hollywood-style special effects , but it ' s strongest point in showing soldier ' s life there , their relationships and their feelings when the best friends are being killed in front of their eyes . in my opinion 9ya rota really does a good job showing all those things . 

again , movie has it weaknesses , but , in my opinion , it appears to be one of the strongest russian movie for the past few years . 

8 / 10 maureen o ' hara is always beautiful and appealing . here she plays an actress terminally ill . we don ' t know with what . it is a bit of a precursor to " love story " in that respect . 

william bendix is good , as is most of the supporting cast . john payne is meant to be grieving but he seems to sleepwalking . the girl who plays the child he and o ' hara adopts does her best with a contrived plot device : of course ! adopt an orphan . she will live on after the passing of your wife . it ' s a sweet movie but it doesn ' t feel sincere . i was hoping to be moved . i was , by o ' hara ' s gentle performance . but i don ' t like to feel manipulated .  this is one dreary , inert , self-important bore . when the only thing that suddenly gives a film life is a hanging , you know the venture is botched . philip seymour hoffman plays truman capote as a narcissistic , tic-ridden , self-indulgent , cartoon-voiced , insect-like caricature . why he is this way is never explained and we get scant background information . the script focuses on capote ' s writing of ' in cold blood ' and his attachment to the damaged brothers who murdered a family of four . the acclaimed writer of ' to kill a mockingbird ' , harper lee ( catherine keener ) , accompanies capote in his initial inquires into the crime , and her presence immediately suggests a far more interesting subject for a biopic . unfortunately , lee is quickly sidelined in favor of endless scenes of capote bemoaning his pained existence . watching him is like watching dr . smith from ' lost in space ' complain about his " delicate back " to anybody who will listen for two hours . the difference , however , is that smith was fun to watch while capote is not . the film ' s precious self-importance kills it , as does director bennett miller ' s reluctance to add any kind of shading . like the morose piano score , the film is a one note wonder , providing no contrast , no emotional coloring , and no intimate drama . if capote really was this irritating , why make a film about him and expect audiences to watch it ? though the supporting roles are well performed ( chris cooper is his usual stalwart self ) , they serve such little dramatic purpose because , ultimately , it ' s all about capote ( ! ) director bennett and screenwriter dan futterman fail to emotionally engage their intended audience because they were clearly overwhelmed by the cultural baggage of capote ' s " legend " . their product is stillborn oscar bait . . . and is more evidence that one great genre pic has more " truth " in it than a dozen piles of oh-so-sincere crap like this .  the message of hero is quite clear : the idea of greater china is more important than the death and the suffering of millions . at a time when china is dangling its war toys over taiwan , it is unacceptable for western viewers to endorse this piece of over-produced , government-sponsored , dogmatic trash . 

particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media . roger ebert of chicago tribune , david edelstein of slate , charles taylor of salon , and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed hero . in so doing , they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message . the only critic ( that i know of ) who saw through the film ' s glossy facade was j . hoberman of the village voice , who wrote of the film ' s " sanctimonious traditionalism " and its " glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness . " i , for one , sign my name under hoberman ' s final pronouncement : hero is nothing more than " fascinating fascism . "  this film was released in the uk under the name blood rites . it was banned outright and never submitted again for release . 

as the ghastly ones , it was supposedly a hit with the horror hungry denizens of new york city ' s famed 42nd street grindhouse circuit . if you are looking for some bloody horror , then you will find it in this film . 

unfortunately to see the developmentally disabled colin ( hal borske ) chomp down on a live rabbit , you have to put up with shaky 16mm camera work that makes ed wood look positively marvelous . 

three sisters are to spend three days in the family homestead with their husbands before the old man ' s money is disbursed . naturally , in such a situation , people start dropping dead . family secrets are exposed and lots of blood is spilled , especially during a gruesome dismemberment . 

maybe it was the bunny bit that the brits objected to , i know i did .  by all appearances this serial could have been made any time since the mid forties . the cardboard sets , the moon kings with lightning bolts sewn onto their aprons , you know the drill . this one is a rocky jones adventure , featuring the space cop ' s dealings with the insufferable bitch queen of planet offeecious , a commie planet that won ' t join the united planets . when the noble messengers of intergalactic reason announce that offeecious is on a collision course with this other , vaguely slavic planet , bitch queen decides to blow the other guys up rather than evacuate her land . this introduces a moral to the effect of " the greatness of a nation is not in its land , but its people , " which is hammered home five or six times in the climactic talkfest . the bq ' s constant nasal ranting about " offeeeecious " provides relief from some seriously wanting space effects , is this a tv show ?  dennis quaid is tryin ' hard to prove us that jerry lee lewis was a dumb guy . and he ' s doing too much to prove it . tv sequences are very good , like a photocopy of old black and white footages . music is fine too , because mr . lewis himself is singing . but the rest is just hollywood b-movie style , with the fifties happy days complex . i think the only good thing in this movie is to see young winona ryder .  this film is about a grieving wife who lost her husband through suicide . she is tormented by her son who refused to speak after that . 

child grief is rarely explored on film , so it is refreshing to see a film like addison ' s wall . however , due to the very nature of the film , there is no tension or drama . apart from a few key emotional moments , everything in the film is very plain . the abrupt ending that does not solve any mysteries certainly do not help the film to be more watchable . addison ' s wall could have been much better , such as exploration of the contents of the wall , a more intensive care program to help addison to go through his trauma . instead , the film feels very unfinished and non engaging .  i remember when this came out it was the first kung fu film ever seen around our way and we were all excited about seeing it for sure . although the action was mediocre at best it gave us our first taste of kung fu and our first taste of bad dubbing as well as bad film making or more precisely the way chinese people were making films at the time . they were admittedly inferior wlthout question but there was entertainment value here and that caught on for sure . the kung fu craze had begun and bruce lee and ' ' the chinese connection ' ' would soon follow either that or ' ' the chinese boxer ' ' with jimmy wang yu . in any case this film was chosen to lead the way .  wrestlemania 2 is the only wrestlemania|thank god| to be held at three different locations , and while it was an interesting idea , it didn ' t really work . there are only really two matches that really struck out , with the rest being decent , or most of them , pretty terrible . there are some entertaining celebrity ' s on hand , like susan saint james , ray charles and cathy crosby , but the experience was a waste of time for the most part . the british bulldgos vs the dream team match , is worth the price of admission itself , but you can honestly see that anywhere . 

matches . 

nassau coliseum . 

paul orndorff vs the magnificent muraco / w mr . fuji . for the time it had , and despite the crappy finish , this was surprisingly bearable stuff , with the crowd being really into it . crowd chants " bullsh * t " at the end . that being said it did nothing for either ' s career . match ends in a double count out with them fighting outside the ring

2 / 5

intercontinental championship match . randy savage|c| vs george " the animal " steele . not that great wrestling wise , but heavily entertaining due to the antics involved , and some great comedy from steele , besides savage can wrestle a potato and make it look interesting . savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes , for leverage . 

2 1 / 2 / 5

jake " the snake " roberts vs george wells . for a throwaway match , this was better than it should have been , but it ' s too short to make any impact what so ever . roberts wins with the ddt , pulling out the snake afterwords , which disgusts saint james . 

1 1 / 2 / 5

boxing match . mr . t / w the hati kid & joe frazier vs roddy piper / w lou duva & bob orton . a huge failure in my opinion . i was bored senseless throughout this , and while it may have been a marketing success , it certainly didn ' t succeed at entertaining me . lot of rowdy chants are noticeable as well . t wins by dq , when piper slams t .

ricky steamboat vs hercules hernandez . pretty decent match up here , with both men putting on solid performances . hercules is a nasty brute , with above average skills , and it contrasted well with steamboat ' s high-flying style . steamboat wins with a high-flying cross body off the top rope .

the funk brothers vs tito santana & jyd . pretty solid match here , with a lot of memorable bumps taken from terry funk|the one through the table was something else for that time| . i would have to rate this as my 2nd favorite . funks win with help from jimmy hart ' s megaphone . 

3 / 5

wwf championship . hulk hogan|c| vs king kong bundy . decent pop for hogan . one of the most over-hyped matches in wrestlemania history . hogan can ' t wrestle worth a lick , and bundy is not that great himself . the violence was brutal for the time , but hogan ' s superhero act is kind of annoying , and there are too many boring moments . hogan wins when he escapes before bundy . 

1 / 5

bottom line . wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most aspects . die hard wrestling fans should see this once , but you really don ' t have too . there isn ' t enough here , to satisfy a true wrestling fan . vince blew it on this one . don ' t be fooled by the hype of the main event , it really is a boring affair , like most of the card . not recommended , and ranks as one of the worst wrestlemania ' s , outside of the brilliant tag title match . 

4 / 10 this appears to be one of noel coward ' s lesser known films , and it is easy to understand why . taken at face value it ' s not a bad film , but there ' s nothing terribly good about it either . nothing much happens at all throughout the course of the film , it ' s simply the story of chris and leonora ' s ill-fated affair , and barbara ' s reaction to it . the only thing that keeps the film interesting is the fact that we already know it ' s going to end badly for one reason or another , owing to the first scene . oddly , there are many perfect opportunities in the story for conflict , and yet none of them are utilised . for example , it would ' ve been much more interesting and believable if barbara had ' ve fallen out with leonora , but instead the two remained on good terms throughout the film . the notion of barbara having been betrayed by her friend was not explored at all - in fact she didn ' t even seem to feel betrayed by her husband ; she even encourages him to go on a holiday with leonora . similarly , chris ' two secretaries at his practice , susan birch and tim verney , who also happen to be close friends of both chris and barbara , are never forced to take sides . in fact , tim shies away from conflict by telling chris that he ' s terribly fond of both him and barbara . despite the strange lack of conflict , the biggest flaw in the film is the fact that we don ' t care whether chris ends up with leonora or barbara . the two womens ' personalities are indistinguishable anyway so we don ' t know which of the two is better suited to be with chris , and besides this , barbara ' s permissiveness gives the impression that she hardly cares about the affair anyway . furthermore , i found chris and leonora ' s relationship somewhat unconvincing . i can overlook the ridiculously short timeframe in which they fall for each other because that is so common in films of this era , but even then the relationship seemed shallow . coward ' s character was too austere and cynical to be the object of leonora ' s affections . he reminds me of the socially inept genius sir earnest pease from the film " very important person " - i ' m sure the two would ' ve gotten along well . chris ' coldness and austerity made his love for leonora seem insincere . i think coward should ' ve sat this one out and given his part to a younger man - as it is , i was constantly wondering what this young beauty saw in such a sombre , mostly emotionless , balding middle aged man . despite all my criticisms , the film still manages to be interesting - just not terribly compelling . the fact that none of the characters are particularly well developed gives them an enigmatic nature , which is somewhat intriguing . the astonished heart is certainly worth watching , but it is a flawed piece of cinema .  the most generic , surface-level biography you could hope for . busey ' s impersonation of holly is accurate -- but who wants to hear gary busey sing " maybe baby " ? typically , the members of the hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama ( smith and stroud , respectively ) instead of as people or even characters . when holly uses a string section , the old jewish-looking guys who come in tell him he ' s using the same techniques as mozart . it ' s just this kind of cheeky statement that makes film biographies like this ( and " amadeus " , about the aforementioned mozart ) so worthless . some entertainment can be derived from holly ' s excellent styles and songs done in a b-variation .  the movie adaptation of heart of darkness is disappointing , both as a movie and as a representation of joseph conrad ' s classic story . 

there are several small differences between the book and movie , but that ' s expected in any book to movie transition . kurtz dies in a different location ; the manager does not accompany marlow on his voyage ; kurtz ' s mistress spends much more time with him than in the story . the real issue is the amount of footage that ' s put into the movie but has no basis in the actual story . for some reason , the director finds the need to " spice up " a few of the scenes , adding drama or actions that seldom make any sense and are always unimportant to the story . some examples that come to mind are kurtz ' s " mistress " beating marlow over the head and knocking him out . nothing happens while he ' s unconscious and marlow didn ' t even provoke the attack . a couple hours pass and he wakes up : total waste of time . kurtz has a pet monkey which , for some random reason , he kills on a whim . also , when marlow leaves kurtz ' s station , he makes the " noble " decision to leave behind all the priceless ivory he had obtained , for no real reason at all . one other flaw is kurtz ' s character . john malkovich is a terrible choice to play the man who is described as tall and inspirational : a man with a commanding presence . he practically whispers all of his lines which , in a more capable actor ' s hands , could have been very thought provoking . i can ' t remove the image of john malkovich playing a mentally disabled farmhand in of mice and men when i ' m watching him botch the role of kurtz . over all , i would rate the movie at 3 out of 10 stars . it ' s a good movie if you ' ve read the book and want to see it in movie form , perhaps to help you visual the scenes , but as a source of entertainment , i would never recommend it .  this is the second addition to frank baum ' s personally produced trilogy of oz films . it ' s essentially the same childishness as in the other two pictures , although i consider it preferable to the others because it ' s shorter . as in the other films , there are performers in animal costumes , an adult woman pretends to be a boy , and the characters and plot jump all over the place while the camera-work is static . this time , at the centre is a magic cloak that grants wishes , and the boy played by a woman is made a king . 

most of the special effects are witnessed at the beginning . fairies are represented by multiple-exposure photography . and , there ' s a man in the moon that looks just like those made by georges mÃ©liÃ¨s years before , most famously in ' le voyage dans la lune ' ( 1902 ) . mÃ©liÃ¨s ' imaginative fantasies and creative trick effects made him the leading pioneer of early cinema , and the films he made around the turn of the century were far better and even technically more advanced than this trifling oz series .  let freedom ring was probably made with the best of intentions , but it sends out a curious mixed message in the final product . 

the folks at a western town where the railroad is coming through are overwhelmed by the arrival of immigrant railroad workers , working on the railroad being financed by robber baron edward arnold . there are a few ranchers and farmers whose land stands in the railroad ' s path and these folks are dealt with summarily by arnold ' s hired men . one man who won ' t give in is lionel barrymore whose son is coming home from harvard a lawyer and ready to take up the rancher ' s cause . 

only nelson eddy decides the best way to fight is to go zorro on the bad guys . but other than charles butterworth no one knows he ' s the wasp ( a very interesting choice of names by the way ) . 

what arnold ' s done is used the tried and true methods of the political bosses of the east , getting the immigrants to vote . nelson ' s idea is simple , if the immigrants only knew the truth about what a bad guy arnold is , they ' ll vote with the original settlers and knock out the alien urban political machine in their midst . he kidnaps newspaper editor raymond walburn and takes him and the press to a mountain cave where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributed . 

the railroad workers are a real mixed bunch of immigrants , not the irish working west or the chinese working east as history has it . it ' s a real united nations working on arnold ' s railroad . the workers are kept in line by foreman victor mclaglen and nelson has the unenviable task of beating some sense into him like john wayne did in the quiet man . 

of all the films that starred jeanette and nelson and they certainly have come down in history as a duo , this was the worst of what they did at mgm . nelson is about to be hanged along with barrymore for crimes that are undefined at best , but certainly nothing worth being hung for . and virginia bruce who plays the nelson ' s girlfriend saves the day with a rendition of my country tis of thee that the immigrants join in with . in the face of a revolt by his paid for immigrant voters , arnold quite rationally packs up and leaves town to build his railroad somewhere else . 

i kid you not , that ' s the ending here . just what is the message , vote with the settlers and lose your jobs with arnold ? but somehow you ' ll get by here ? 

i do wonder some times if 20 years from after the incidents of this film take place and the town as settled into a sleepy backwater of the west while some towns where the railroad has come through that are now cities , that the good citizens of that town haven ' t rethought about what nelson eddy did . if they did they ' re probably running him out on a rail . 

nelson is of course in good voice and has a variety of concert and popular pieces to sing including a ballad to the immigrants written by sigmund romberg , where else but here . the song is a heartfelt tribute from an immigrant who did make good in his adopted country . too bad it didn ' t have a better venue . 

the almost platinum blonde virginia bruce i ' m sure is dubbed here . and i ' m sure jeanette macdonald was just as happy she wasn ' t accompanying nelson on this trip west .  maybe , like most others who have seen this film long after it ' s premiere on television , i wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure form , which is exactly what ' slow burn ' is . except , aside from the nostalgic value , the movie itself is not very good . 

eric roberts plays former reporter jacob ash , hired by a gerald mcmurty ( raymond j . barry ) , a rich artist , to investigate the whereabouts of his estranged son , brian , who had been living with his mother , laine ( beverly d ' angelo ) for the past few years . in a phillip marlowe-esquire fashion jacob ash narrates what would become more than just an investigation into the whereabouts of brian . but , once jacob tracks down laine , his discoveries break open wide a whole lot of trouble . perhaps because events in the film move too slowly , there is never much suspense to this little thriller , not even by the end with the finale routine of revealing the culprits and their motives . 

however , as said before , this movie is probably one that will draw attention for it ' s then-relatively unknown cast of actors , which include both a very young eric roberts as well as the adorable johnny depp , who plays laine ' s stepson , donnie . that may be reason enough to give it a try . . . if you can find it .  ill-tempered , verbally abusive movie studio chief runs his male assistant ragged with nit-picking requests , keeping the young man firmly under his thumb with constant threats of unemployment ; after a year of office-terror , the working stiff finally cracks . writer-director george huang has possibly bit off more than he can chew here . his " swimming with sharks " isn ' t a diatribe against hollywood , nor is it a tribute to the hard-working underling . . . instead , it ' s stunt film-making with a twist , a one-trick pony with tunnel-vision . the surroundings don ' t look or feel like tinsel town ( perhaps due to a limited budget ) , and we never get a sense of this stressful environment as a movie-making entity ( it could be a realtor ' s office in the valley , for all we know ) . lead kevin spacey , who also served as one of the film ' s producers , gives a controlled and focused performance as the power-mad mogul whose ego is out of control ; he does good work , and yet the character doesn ' t ring true . we learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and high-ranking status fail to jibe with what we do see ; who does this man answer to ? what drives him beyond humiliating others for sport ? what projects is he juggling aside from the one script we see passed around ? the film is so emotionally stunted and underpopulated , it begins to seem like a stage-play padded out for the big screen--and yet one without enough characters or motivations in it . perhaps huang wanted to keep things simple , but instead his movie looks like a half-baked project which needed a lot more insight , humor , and atmosphere . * * from * * * *  i guess i was prepared after all the years of hearing about it . first heard about it from siskel and ebert . when they said divine ate excrement , i had to look it up . then a friend told me about it in 1991 . she said also that her parents saw it when it first came out and that her mom almost dumped her dad over it ! so by the time i caught pink flamingos on sundance today , i was prepared . for the most part . 

i still couldn ' t help but be surprised by the anal close-ups and the blowjob scene . that said , the only characters i sympathized with were edie and the egg man . her crying scene early in the film , though over something frivolous to normal people , actually makes me sad . though she sure wasn ' t pretty , she had a cute voice . i was happy for her and the egg man , and they actually touched me . 

on the other hand , the acting in this poverty-level production was not good . and as for the script , just how does john waters come up with this stuff ? well , at least it ' s different .   ' the shining ' has wit , visual flair and an iconic performance by jack nicholson . ' ausentes , ' however , has none of these things ; although it does borrow from its classic forebear ; to wit , a man hacking through a door and a woman running around shrieking while clutching a huge kitchen knife . unlike stanley kubrick ' s great psychological horror film , ' ausentes ' is a work which resonates with a singular lack of genius . it is magnificently , comically awful ; it makes the spice girls movie look like a work of vital art . ' ausentes ' is the tale of a family that moves to a gated community in the suburbs . all is to be well with the world . they will live in peace and tranquillity ; they will calmly go about their business away from those mean old city streets . but no . ariadna gill ' s character julia starts getting spooked by those things that insist on going bump in the night , by empty supermarkets and doors that close themselves ; and her husband samuel , played by jordi molla , switches in an instant from laid-back family man to wild-eyed permanently unshaven nutter , injecting julia with a drug to keep her under his sudden cosh . molla , much respected as an actor , is absolutely dreadful in this . comic rather than menacing , he simply cannot pull off a threatening expression . he just come across as a barroom slime ball who ' s had one drink too many . so is there anything to redeem this film ? no . the script is clunky , the plot non-existent and the cast without merit . completely without tension and full of be scared now moments , ' ausentes ' is an exercise in how not to make a psychological thriller . it is ridiculous and overblown , but as one of the most unintentionally hilarious films of recent years it ' s well worth a watch .  loosely based on novels by earl derr biggers , 20th century fox ' s charlie chan series proved an audience favorite--but when japan attacked pearl harbor the studio feared audiences would turn against its asian hero . this was a miscalculation : actor sidney toler took the role to " poverty row " monogram studios , where he continued to portray the character in eleven more films made between 1944 and his death in 1947 . 

20th century fox had regarded the chan films as inexpensive " b " movies , but even so the studio took considerable care with them : the plots were often silly , but the pace was sharp , the dialogue witty , and the casts ( which featured the likes of bela lugosi and ray milland ) always expert . the result was a kindly charm which has stood the test of time . monogram was a different matter : chan films were " b " movies plain and simple . little care was taken with scripts or cast and resulting films were flat , mediocre at best , virtually unwatchable at worst . 

thanks to an adequate cast and a few interesting plot devices , the shanghai cobra is among the best of the monogram-made chan films--but even so it barely manages to achieve a consistent mediocrity . in this particularly entry , chan ( sidney toler ) is called upon to investigate a murderer who kills with what appears to be a cobra-like bite ; at the same time , he decides to make certain that a government supply of radium tucked away in a bank vault , of all places , remains secure . do these two seemingly unrelated plot lines come together ? well . . . could be ! sidney toler is always enjoyable as chan , but most of his monogram performances seemed " phoned in " --and that is as true of cobra as it is of any monogram chan film . as usual , the really enjoyable performer is mantan mooreland . changing times have led us to look upon moreland ' s brand of comedy as demeaning to african-americans , but he was an expert actor and comic , and taken within the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s his work has tremendous charm and innocence . 

fans of the 20th century fox series are likely to find monogram ' s chan a significant disappointment and newcomers who like the monogram films will probably consider them third-rate after encountering the fox films . like other monogram chan films , the shanghai cobra is best left to determined collectors . four stars , and that ' s being generous . 

gft , amazon reviewer director / screenwriter diane english ' s 2008 update of george cukor ' s 1939 mgm classic comedy unfortunately shows more mothballs than its predecessor . based on clare booth luce ' s shrewdly observant 1936 play on the relationships that evolve among a strictly female group of pampered manhattan socialites , the story would seem ripe for a contemporary remake . instead , because of english ' s thematic overreach , the production comes across as an extended therapy session with a paucity of wit . what ' s more , the diverse lifestyles of women today have been reduced to sitcom-level stereotypes in this movie , and the original play ' s central conceit of eliminating men from the storyline seems even more contrived given the openly pansexual evolution that has occurred among men as well as women since the 1930 ' s . to add insult to injury , the recent big screen adaptation of hbo ' s " sex and the city " did this sort of sorority-style dishing much better and with far sharper fangs . 

the skeleton of the original play remains as the story centers on wealthy mary haines , who gave up her promising clothing design career to become the devoted wife of a wall street financial wizard . like " sex and the city " , she is surrounded by three best friends - sylvie fowler , a successful , cutthroat magazine editor in the mold of miranda priestly in " the devil wears prada " ( yet another film this echoes ) ; perennially pregnant edie cohen representing the stay-at-home wife ; and alex fisher , a lesbian author who seems to represent every repressed group generally excluded from such an exclusive clique . through a mouthy manicurist , they find out mary ' s husband is having an affair with man-eater crystal allen , a perfume girl at saks more than willing to break up a marriage as she struggles to become an actress . the rest of the plot doesn ' t matter much since it becomes a series of scenes focused on sisterly bonding and bickering , none of it very illuminating and without the satirical zing that buoyed the 1939 movie . 

looking strangely youthful at 47 , meg ryan seems to play mary in a manner that tries to resuscitate the goodwill she engendered in the 1990 ' s with " when harry met sally " and " sleepless in seattle " . it ' s not that she isn ' t age-appropriate here , but her familiar sprightliness seems at odds with the character ' s passive nature . annette bening fares somewhat better in the scene-stealing rosalind russell role of sylvie because she has proved to be adept at conveying hardness while masking vulnerability , but her character goes through such a trite transformation that it undermines the actress ' performance severely . poor eva mendes has to play crystal as a shallow , transparent shopgirl versus the smart , hard-edged cookie joan crawford got to play . debra messing and jada pinkett smith are scooted way to the sidelines as edie and alex , respectively . much better are candice bergen as mary ' s savvy , supportive mother and cloris leachman as the non-nonsense housekeeper . 

probably reflecting the lackluster box office response to the film ' s release , the 2008 dvd doesn ' t have a robust set of extras . there are two deleted scenes - one with crystal and her friends having a girls ' night-in as a contrast to mary ' s elaborate garden party , and the other an extension of bette midler ' s cameo as a multi-married hollywood agent counseling mary during a late night at a yoga camp . two featurettes round out the extras " " the women : the legacy " about the history behind the film from the original 1936 play , and " the women behind the women " which has the cast and crew speak endlessly about female self-empowerment and self-image . the irony is that this version of " the women " directed and scripted by a woman takes such a patronizing look at women .  i saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in 1988 and though i knew it wasn ' t of award winning caliber . . . i kinda liked it . it tales the tale of 5 former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids - which is to climb mt . whitehead . of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways , but none too differently than they were as children . richard lewis is still neurotic , richard belzer is still a playboy , franklyn ajaye is still sort of the dear abby of the group , and tim thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group . of course the top billed star is louie anderson , a " true believer " in everything cub scout related . he still lives in the same house with his mother , still goes over the cub scout manual daily , is brave , reverent and clean , and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in scouting . compounding their task , however , is the grunski brothers , two bullies drummed out of the cub scouts by the above mentioned . by coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit , albeit harmlessly . not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts , who think pack 7 is from the fbi and are intent on wiping them out . all in all , the movie still has bits of charm . observe richard lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot , for example , and you have a really funny bit going for you . upon further review , the entire film needed more of that type of observational humor . it doesn ' t hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure .  michael dudikoff stars as joe armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the u . s army , in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless martial arts actioner , which is hampered by too many long pauses without action , but helped by some high energy action setpieces as well as steve james ' performance .  thomas edison had no other reason to make this film except to show that film can capture the electrocution of an innocent elephant . edison was not a genius but a man out for money and profit ; his love for life was measured by dollars , not experiences , as this film shows .  i like errol flynn ; i like biographies and i like action movies . this featured all three of these . . . . but i didn ' t like this film . it just went on too long although the last 20 minutes was excellent , especially in the photography with some great low- angle shots . however , i seemed like it took six hour to get to that point , and i really can ' t say why i feel this way . 

the action is interesting , errol flynn and olivia de havilland are fine . in fact , it was refreshing to see de havilland actually be supportive of flynn instead of her normal role as antagonist to him . yet something is lacking in this movie . 

the film has been roundly criticized for its historical inaccuracy but i don ' t hear that same criticism for a lot of other films which have done the same . in fact , its rare when a film is historically accurate . for some reason , this revisionist history offended most critics . if the film had made general custer a lot worse than he really was , they would have probably liked it . well , too bad . in their twisted way , critics prefer villains to heroes . 

i really wish i could have enjoyed this more but i ' ll take a lot of other flynn adventures over this one .  joan fontaine is swept off her feet by the suave cary grant . after their marriage , she realizes that her husband is very irresponsible and owes a major gambling debt . it appears that grant tries to scheme his best friend , nigel bruce , out of part of his life savings . bruce ends up murdered and fontaine suspects that her husband will try to kill her for the insurance money . this drama drags on to an abrupt and flat finale .  the beginning of the film is promising . when jeanne pollet ( anna mouglalis ) hear the story of the incident that happen on the day she was born that raise the possibility that she is the daughter of a famous pianist , andrÃ© polonski ( jacques dutrone ) , she set to find out whether it ' s true or not , and giving the fact the she plays also the piano that ' s not such a remote idea . jeanne meet andrÃ© and his wife " mika " muller ( isabelle huppert ) and their son and on the way uncover the fact that there are some secrets in that family as much in her own . 

o . k . we have seen this before and it has been done in a more interesting way than here . the character of " mika " muller is left with out us understanding her motives to her action and she is not interesting enough to care for her . the piano scenes look fake and the whole piano sub-plot doesn ' t add anything to the character ' s insight but serve as to make the film longer than it should have been in the first place . 

in short a very disappointing outing from chabrol , who can do better than this this film is about the complicated friendship , romance and deceit between two men and two women during the world war ii . 

a lot of effort has been put to make " the edge of love " look the right period . however , i find this effort too excessive , particularly in terms of the tone of the colours . most of the first half of the film is processed so much to have a strong bluish tone . it ' s hard to make out who ' s who in this tone . 

another detrimental point is the fancy use of image splitting lens . there are many scenes that have three or four images of the same thing , such as three keira knightley smiling face or four pairs of arms in embrace . that simply makes the film confusing and hard to follow , instead of being artistic . 

as for the plot , it is plain boring . the way the story unfolds is not engaging at all . sienna miller ' s unstable character is annoying . in fact all the main characters are annoying and unlikeable . keira knightley ' s accent is impossible to understand , making it a further impediment to understanding the plot . 

i strongly advise avoiding " the edge of love " , unless you watch a film only to appreciate great costumes , nice sets and lighting .  people call a 976 " party line " to talk dirty to strangers , and perhaps meet up for a sexual liason . a deranged , somewhat incestuous sister and occasional transvestite brother use the line to find people to kill , usually married men , but they don ' t discriminate ! a pair of sixteen year old girls also call the line for fun , pretending to be older , of course . one of them works as a babysitter for a married man who ' s hot for her ( or anyone ) . 

meanwhile , a vice cop is borrowed by homicide when he ' s the first to discover one of the siblings ' victims . he ' s teamed with a female assistant of the district attorney . 

nothing too special here . richard roundtree has little more than a cameo as the police chief . one of the dirty-talking sixteen year olds is played by an actress who also voiced peanuts character peppermint patty ! according to the imdb , the other died quite young , just several years after this movie : sad .  a giant praying mantis is awakened from its sleep in the artic region and heads south causing havoc . boats , planes and trains meet their match with the flying creature . before unleashing its full wrath on nyc , the mantis meets its doom at the hands of the armed forces in a new york tunnel . the special effects are of course crude by todays standards , but for a ten year old boy in 1957 this was very memorable . 

starring are william hopper , craig stevens , alix talton and pat conway .  if daphne du maurier had set rebecca in 1950s san francisco , it might very well resemble this uptight , highly unusual noir from robert wise . valentina cortese plays a concentration camp survivor who steals the identity of a dead woman and insinuates herself into the life of richard basehart ( who happens also to be the guardian of the dead woman ' s son ) . . . it ' s absurd and over-the-top but also topflight entertainment . cortese is terrific , slowly falling apart as she realizes the mistake she ' s made . basehart is fine if a bit bland . . . although the lighting toward the end makes him appear very menacing . fay baker makes a very good mrs . danvers-like caretaker . wise is a fine director and he keeps things moving at a pretty brisk clip . he also stages a now classic out of control car crash with cortese ( or at least a stunt cortese ) at the wheel .  from the film ' s first shot - keira knightley as elizabeth bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn , thus invoking all the clichÃ©s cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - i knew i was in for something to make me want to kill myself . 

joe wright seemed not only to have not read the book , but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact jane austen ' s subtle , nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling , delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawing-rooms , but a sort of u-certificate wuthering heights . thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason , in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain . not to mention that jane austen , and in particular p & p , is not about passion , sexual tension or love . it ' s about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society . which was completely ignored , so that the bennets ' house was a rambunctious , chaotic place where everybody shouts at once , runs around , leaves their underwear on chairs , and pigs wander happily through the house ; the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a matrix reloaded style dance-orgy ; and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety . 

the genius of jane austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety , and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap . so both the brilliance of jane austen and the very factor that allows her plots - particularly in this film - to function was completely erased . subtlety in general was nowhere int his film , sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances . 

it was so obviously trying to be a * serious * film . the humour - which is pride & prejudice , both austen ' s methodology and her appeal - was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po-faced melodrama , and when it was allowed in , was handled so clumsily . pride & prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points , yes , but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour , they are embedded in it . you can ' t lose jane austen ' s technique , leaving only the bare bones of the story , and expect the themes to remain . not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy-handed mystical-numinous fauxbrow cinematography . 

elizabeth bennett is supposed to be a woman , an adult , mature and sensible and clear-sighted . keira knightley played the first half of the film like an empty-headed giggling schoolgirl , and the second half like an empty-headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine . elizabeth ' s wit , her combative verbal exchanges , her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody ' s follies including her own , her strength and composure , and her fantastic clear-sightedness were completely lost and replaced with . . . what ? a lot of giggling and staring into the distance ? rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs , she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not genuinely raging , either ; no , these were petulant hissy fits . and where the great strength of austen ' s elizabeth ( at least in austen ' s eyes ) was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety , knightley ' s elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention . furthermore , she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong-minded , and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it . an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance . in which quest for blandness and weakness , she was ably matched by matthew macfayden . 

donald sutherland as mr bennet seemed weak , ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes mr bennet so fascinating and tragic . his special bond with lizzie , as the only two sensible people in a world of fools , was completely lost , not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools , and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact . mr bingley was no longer amiable and well-meaning to the point of folly , but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs , and the woman who was playing jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all . the script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of jane austen - delivered with remarkable clumsiness - and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy . 

just get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache .  i started to take a critical view on this adaptation within the first few minutes but as a dedicated jane austen fan i persevered through to the end . . . however , this is not a programme i would recommend to someone unfamiliar with her work as i don ' t think it does the book justice , nor makes particularly entertaining television in its own right . there was something about this adaptation that lacked believability - many of the costumes and even the actors did not have an authentic look and i found the acting to be , at times , poor . there is no doubt that the actors were all very good-looking , but this didn ' t provide enough variety to create really diverse , memorable characters . it was far too static being set entirely in the same location and missing out fanny ' s return home , which is one of the most interesting parts of the story . the best actor was blake ritson , who captured the wholesomeness of edmund very well , and the crawfords were effectively cast too . i do like billie piper as an actress , but this role did not suit her and was much better played by frances o ' connor in the 1999 version who gave overall a far more subtle and convincing performance . jane austen adaptations will always provide a love story to leave you feeling good but unfortunately , this is one of the worst i have seen .  although this film has had a lot of praise , i personally found it boring . there are some nice brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable , but the story of how they interrelate , even if very unusual by our standards , is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long . the central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first . as the tolerance of the various men is stretched , we see their characters develop . the story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting . it is a rare glimpse into the brasilian hinterland , far from the city , but hardly exciting enough to keep one ' s eyes open for .  jeff powers ( lou diamond phillips , " young guns 1 & 2 " ) , a cop with a history of roughing up criminals , is recruited into an elite clandestine lapd division . this doesn ' t sit well with jeff ' s newspaper reporter girlfriend , kelly ( chelsea field ) who ' s looking for a story on the squad . soon enough jeff ' s conscience gets the better of him which puts him at odds with dan vaughn ( scott glenn , " the hunt for red october " & " backdraft " ) , the leader of the unit . 

this is a fairly routine , dare i say mundane , cop-action / drama that holds no surprises thanks to a cookie-cutter plot that ' s content to go strictly from point a to point b . the acting is all right for what the actors were given to work with however that ' s no real reason to watch the film . kinda sad seeing as the six previous mark l . lester directed films right before this one ( from class of 1984 to showdown in little tokyo ) were all highly entertaining vehicles . 

eye candy : chelsea field gets briefly topless

my grade : d+ maybe it ' s because i read peter straub ' s wonderful book before seeing the film , but i was terribly disappointed by this movie . in my opinion , the filmmakers removed everything that made the story interesting and unique , and replaced it with more common hollywood-style elements . 

it ' s too bad , too , since this movie has a terrific cast , particularly fred astaire , douglas fairbanks , jr . , melvyn douglas , john houseman , and the then-largely-unknown alice krige . they ' re just not given very much worthwhile to do . 

in fact , i was all for leaving halfway through , but a friend convinced me to stay to the end , as he was sure it had to get better . he apologised to me during the closing credits .  anna kokkinos ' success with ' head on ' now begins to look like it depended totally on the script and alex dimitriades great lead performance . the degree to which this latest , " the book of revelation " is both derivative , pretentious and utterly unoriginal ( except for tristan milani ' s fine cinematography ) seems to bear this out . . 

alas , there have already been quite a few aussie movies dealing with such themes , some reviled for ' sexism ' ( and / or explicit sex scenes ) in the 1970s and 1980s and beyond and maybe they ' re worth looking at again after this piece of fluff . of course , setting the whole thing in the world of ballet and making it all achingly slow ( and in its choreography , like a 1960s dutch ballet experimental number ) does suggest great art if you ' ve not traveled around much-and then only if you never progressed beyond art theory 101 . 

add to the pretension , appallingly arch dialog ( " you will do as we command . . . " ) and the whole shebang falls onto its well funded face . then there are the ' sexy ' bits : straight from dario argento . 

given the lovely but truncated performance by colin friels - how about a real city primeval thriller ? 

all in , all , with ' the book of revelation ' , the feminist project has been set back yet another decade - and with the willing and deeply imitative ( of male writers like henry miller , william burroughs , even bukowski ) collaboration of some collective in melbourne , oz , suffering from a form of educational -and ideological- amnesia ! no revelations await us here .  i guess that after leonard nimoy had been successful in directing " the search for spock " and " the voyage home , " william shatner thought he could direct too . although he is a competent actor , he shows here that he ' s just not a good director . 

actually , this movie is hard evidence to support the arguments of trekkies who say that william shatner being an arrogant egomaniac . for although his character , captain james kirk , was always arguably the most important role in the original " star trek , " it seems in this movie that he is the heart of the movie , the two other most important characters , captain spock and doctor leonard mccoy , are just there to support him , and the other characters are just there to add comic relief . 

the plot is that some emotional vulcan outcast named sybok is mindmelding with people and releasing the pain bottled up inside them from that traumatic event early in life that changed them forever . grateful , they join him in his quest to make the entire world free of pain and thus at peace . sybok and his followers commandeer the building in which a peace conference between a human , klingon , and romulan diplomat is taking place . this lures the still-being-constructed enterprise there , since none of starfleet ' s other ships have " experienced commanders " ( honestly , with how starfleet is run , the klingons and romulans should have conquered them years ago ) . sybok adds the enterprise ' s crew , save spock ( who is revealed to be secret brothers with sybok ) , mccoy , and kirk . sybok orders that the enterprise take off to " the center of the universe " to meet " god , " who apparently every race has a word for . however , it turns out that this is only a minor entity when he demands the use of the enterprise and kirk asks , " what does god need with a starship . " the entity is destroyed , but not before sybok , realizing he ' s been lied to for years , sacrifices his life and earns spock ' s respect in death after the enterprises photon torpedos destroy the entity and inexplicably sybok as well . 

ok , science fiction movies are not known for realism , but at some point , rationality must be enforced . why do people follow sybok just for releasing their pain ? why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event ? i ' ve certainly led a trauma-free life . why doesn ' t kirk try his crew for mutiny and treason after they join sybok ? what was the point of sybok sacrificing himself when the torpedos were going to kill the entity anyway ? 

so the plot ' s weak . another problem is that sybok , though played well by lawrence luckinbill , is poorly portrayed . just because he ' s an emotional vulcan doesn ' t mean he should act exactly like a human religious fanatic . shatner ( who was a co-writer as well as the director ) could have at least developed dialog fitting for an emotional vulcan . i guess he feels that any emotional being talks like us . gee , i guess that means that klingons should say " isn ' t " and " don ' t " more often than " is not " and " do not . " and the cardassians shouldn ' t prolong their sentences because they like to talk ( yeah , i know it ' s sad that i know this ) . please . . . every st race uses unique dialog . why is sybok the exception . 

the only thing to not complain about is the acting . i ' ve always known " star trek " to have great actors , and this movie is not exception . cudos also go to leonard nimoy , for it had to be difficult to play the dispassionate spock in his old age . 

some other things i didn ' t like : 

shatner and the late deforrest kelly twice show what bad singers they are by singing " row , row , row your boat " in this movie . i guess shatner wished to silence his detractors of his singing ability . what he did was prove their point . 

uhura does a fan dance while wearing nothing but tree bark to draw some men into a booby trap . after all , the dreams of all us men are filled with images of middle-aged plump women dancing naked . 

comedy ' s all well and good as long as it doesn ' t affect the nature of " star trek " too much , but when scotty bumps into an object on the enterprise and kos himself , it ' s kinda goin ' overboard . 

kirk is the only crew member who can reject sybok ' s offer of releasing their inner pain and see through the god imposter ' s deception . not even spock can manage either of these ? perhaps this scenes were valantines from shatner to his character , as many suspect . 

the concept of an entity posing as god had been used in " star trek " before this movie more than once . be creative , shatner . 

speaking of uncreativeness , i didn ' t purticularly care for the ripping off of the music of " star trek : the next generation . " 

all in all , pretty bad " trek " movie . if you ' re a trekkie , watch it once because it ' s " star trek . " otherwise , watch " star trek ii : the wrath of khan . " it ' s way better .  again , we ' re getting a melange of themes well covered by so many previous films . the good and the bad son story , courtesy east of eden . the american marine hero story , who doesn ' t consider himself to be one due to what he knows . and the grieving wife potentially falling in love with another man story . 

the mere fact of those stories being that ubiquitous isn ' t so much of a problem though . because theoretically they could still be better presented and dealt with each time around . no luck this time though , as all three of those threads ultimately fall flat all the same . 

as the bad son never really gets to talk to his father , so that conflict is never resolved properly . apart from the father kind of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter renovating the kitchen of the grieving wife . now , how satisfying is that . 

next , the surprisingly homecoming marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness conflict never gets resolved . because he never really talks to the man under suspicion , namely his own brother . so once more we ' re handed a loose end here . 

and finally , the american military heroism hypocrisy theme , where the marine is publicly considered a hero when , due to the dirtiness of war he went through , he shouldn ' t really be called one as to his own standards , that third theme falls flat just the same . because the movie ends right when , for the first time , he ' s just able to talk to his wife about what he went through . where the real story would actually begin at that very point , namely his process of recovery , how that would look like and how he would finally face the family he ' d have some major guilt to admit to . all that , all the really interesting bits are passed over and getting ignored . 

so while story wise this film is a serious , and i mean serious , disappointment , i ' d still give it points for the impressive cast . although no film should use maguire for a voice over , because that belongs to spiderman . especially a grown up gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor . so much that i ' d in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profile . 

so while the cast really seems to do what they can , i consider this film totally forgettable otherwise . a shallow and ultimately pretentious , utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed . message du jour to the writers : we know the wounds already , see the host of vietnam films . you want to earn some credit , show us a believable healing .  as one who loves films that appeal to intellectual sorties as well as those that simply tell stories , this film should have been appealing . but as written and directed by catherine breillat who seems to be playing out her own conundrums in film-making experiences , this tedious and talky film fails to arouse interest . 

the main character jeanne ( anne parillaud ) is the screen form of breillat , a director frustrated in her attempts to film a convincing sex scene with two difficult actors ( grÃ©goire colin is the actor and roxane mesquida is the actress ) . the one ' comic ' bit is jeanne ' s imposing the use of a dildo strapped onto the actor in order for her to drive the sex scene to fruition , but even this sight gag wears thin quickly and we are left with a film within a film that feels more like a ' deleted scenes ' featurette on a dvd than a solid french comedy with class . grady harp , august 05  " ordinary decent criminal " is sort of based on the exploits of martin cahill , already the subject of john boorman ' s 1998 film " the general " . cahill had a rough upbringing in a slum area and graduated from petty crime to armed robbery with honours . he justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor background at every opportunity . this is a common excuse for criminals that conveniently overlooks the thousands of slum-dwellers who don ' t turn to robbing post offices and selling guns in order to make ends meet . cahill made fools of the police and local authorities , not to mention the ira , which earned him a sort of " folk hero " status as well as making him many enemies . however , he was basically an amoral , self-serving thief . 

my primary problem with " odc " is that the protagonist is made out to be a lovable irish rogue . kevin spacey does a good job portraying michael lynch with a blend of oily charm and quiet menace , but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as any sort of hero , even an anti-hero . 

the film is well shot and well acted by a fine cast , but what lets it down is the script . writer gerard stembridge can ' t make up his mind ; is he writing an irish " lock stock " or a grittier treatment of martin cahill ' s thieving career ? that ' s the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person . 

it ' s also unfortunate that " odc " followed the cinema release of john boorman ' s " the general " , which was a more accurate portrayal of martin cahill ' s story . cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity , so it ' s not surprising that his exploits got the movie treatment . 

what is surprising is that a studio was prepared to take cahill ' s story and give it a happy hollywood-style ending . kevin spacey ' s charismatic-twinkly-bigamist-thief michael lynch gets to ride off into anonymity on his motorcycle in " odc " . in the real world , martin cahill was executed by the ira , just to prove that no-one makes fools of an out-dated , sectarian and corrupt para-military organisation and gets away with it . 

the real cahill would never have walked away from his notoriety because it bolstered his " man of the people " self-image . having michael lynch give up everything to avoid death in " odc " is a cop-out ending to a weak and shallow movie .  i saw this movie in 1956 and again on cable a few days ago . the movie hasn ' t improved with age . quite the opposite . it ' s a true spaghetti epic . 

the trojans are heroic and likable ; the greeks are nasty , petty and sneaky . 

so what if paris ran off with the king ' s wife ? hey . . . love is love .  our story : two u . s . navy deep sea divers search for silver coins hidden beneath the ocean off the filipino coast . our proof : extremely dull entertainment at its best , with no plot in sight . jim brown is completely wasted , provided his help in producing this 70s war turkey . richard jaeckel is in his usual form . don cornelius and richard pryor are among those who gave special thanks in their contributions ! bombs away ! ! !  it has been a long time since i have been to a movie as lame and boring as this one . it is one thing to have a slow pace where characters are being developed in a progressive way , or some aspect of the movie clearly is enhanced by such pacing ( such as ' lost in translation " ) . however , there is a difference between slow progression and outright stalling , as happened in this one . i guess from the look on helen mirren ' s face she must have been distraught by the disappearance of her husband ! ! surprise , surprise ! ! what a marvelously creative moment the meeting of the mistress and wife was . ( sarcasm ) and what a great way that the whole story fell apart at the end . truly a masterpiece .  this is one of those so-called " hollywood social commentary " films that wants to have it both ways . and believe me , in this film , both ways are clichÃ©d and stereotypical . stop-loss is a 21st century john wayne film dealing with some anti-war sentiment but clearly ending on the note that " if you are a man in today ' s society , you get your act together and march off to war with your buddies . " in many ways the film was a great sequel to taxi to the dark side as it portrayed a military equally as insane and out of control , a quasi frat party / animal house extravaganza mixed in with a texas red neck world of repressed homo-erotic proofs of masculinity . this movie had it all in one scene after another of clichÃ©d imagery . and then rebellious military deserter ryan phillippe goes on a " road trip " with best friend ' s girlfriend , an artificial storyline manipulation to visit families of dead servicemen , maimed soldiers in military hospitals , etc . and finally to broach the issue of fleeing to canada or mexico . but male honor and patriotism win out in the end , as all freshly scrubbed and handsome , he rides off into the sunset on a bus with his buddies back to iraq and a world that a few minutes before he assured everyone he could never again tolerate . full metal jacket meets sands of iwo jima . but in the end , john wayne rides again ! and a hollywood blockbuster ultimately gets to keep both sides of its audience in the palm of its hand . at least it would like to think so . as far as i was / am concerned , just take me back to the more convincing reality of in the garden of elah .  apart from the da ( james eckhouse ) , and a brief appearing woman who is convincingly sympathetic to ellen gulden ' s ( renee zellweger ) plight , ellen herself is the only convincing character--and likable character in the movie . she is the one , not her dying mother , who should be and is--the one true thing . it ' s not only in the role , in zellweger ' s acting , but also in the plot itself . . . . until , the plot turns against itself--and makes the mother the " one true thing " in the eyes of her weak willed , shallow husband who can do nothing right for his wife or daughter . the daughter perceives what the viewer perceives , but such intelligent perceptions must give way to the shallow sentiment of the husband who is blanked out on both the realities of his wife and daughter . 

to boot , the one powerful scene in this whole movie , when ellen confronts her father ' s cruelty , is given the lie at the end . ellen is just another young strong woman who must be tamed into conformity by a crybaby father . a very flawed movie--so flawed as to be called a bore and not worth the time .  this movie is about a young girl who goes to live with her rich cousins falls in love with one of her cousin , and reject the advance of a amoral suitor who brings trouble on the family . after seeing the 1999 version and reading the book , i decided to watch the older version . i found it did stay true to fanny character in the book , but it was also boring character . fanny character played by sylvestra le touzel was lackluster ; she often appeared to be about to faint . i also did not like robert bourbage who played henry crawford . i could not imagine him being interested in fanny or her cousin maria . jackie smith wood who played mary crawford was okay but the wig she wore was so ugly . i lost interested in her acting and i kept staring at her wig . i kept expecting it would drop off her head . i could also see a slip of her real hair under the wig .  in all honesty , i haven ' t seen this film for many years , but the few times i have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory , as anyone who has seen it will understand . i first saw it as a child at a ymca halloween party in the early sixties , and it scared the hell out of us kids , in a fun way . i remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze . i can ' t risk giving away the ending , except to say that it was surprising , to say the least . i remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler , followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed . the ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history , and yet oddly moving , in a way . you have to see it for yourself , which is not easy these days . i don ' t know if it ' s available on home video or not , but it would still make a great halloween feature for both kids and adults .  mount godwin-austin ( otherwise known as k2 ) is the world ' s second highest mountain , and if the evidence presented in this film is to be believed is the hardest mountain to climb successfully without getting yourself killed . " k2 " is basically a buddy flick set in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering . while the outdoor photography takes in some truly awesome scenery , the characters standing in front of all those glorious landscapes are a crashing bore - and therein lies the fault with the whole film . 

cocksure lawyer taylor brooks ( michael biehn ) and his quiet married friend harold jamieson ( matt craven ) spend their free time rock climbing . during one of their trips , they meet up with another bunch of climbers funded by wealthy mountain enthusiast philip claibourne ( raymond j . barry ) . claibourne ' s team are in training for a forthcoming shot at the infamous k2 , a mountain that taylor and harold would both love to tackle but could never afford to do so . during their training run , however , two of claibourne ' s team get themselves killed in an avalanche . taylor and harold put themselves forward as potential replacements . despite initial reluctance , claibourne gives them the nod of approval and the pair find themselves joining his team in the himalayas . harold ' s wife cindy ( julia nickson-soul ) is distraught that her husband is going to take on such a dangerous climb , especially since he has recently become a father . tensions in the climbing team mount as taylor repeatedly clashes with another member of the group , the equally brash and arrogant dallas woolf ( luca bercovici ) . meanwhile , claibourne himself grows increasingly ill as altitude sickness takes its toll on his body . will the guys reach the peak of k2 , or is their quest destined to end in disappointment , or even death ? 

 " k2 " spends an inordinately long time introducing its somewhat dislikeable characters . biehn as a foul-mouthed , pushy , adventurous type is especially hard to like , as is barry as the hard-nosed mountaineering millionaire . but on the other side of the coin , craven is so dull that it becomes difficult to believe his wife could possibly give a damn about him going off to climb k2 - heck , she ' d be better off if he never came back ! ! rounding off the main characters is bercovici , whose characterisation as dallas woolf is as campy and over-the-top as every other role he ' s ever played . the story itself is totally tame and disposable Â just a straightforward yarn about guys trying to reach the top of a mountain . there ' s a bit of male bonding thrown in , but the whole subplot about harold and his wife amounts to nil , and the personality clashes between taylor and dallas ring totally false . " k2 " scores its few merits solely from the stunning cinematography by gabriel berastain Â during the himalayan sequences , the scale and awe of the mountains is quite nicely captured . i ' m completely with critic kim newman on this one , who hilariously stated in empire magazine : " on this evidence , climbing k2 can ' t be any harder than sitting through it ! " quite true , kim , quite true !  i first watched kindred in 1987 along with another movie called devouring waves . i remember back then i hated them both and i have never really bothered to watch them again . 

however i have recently started a crusade to collect as many 80 ' s horror titles in their original boxed form , that have been deleted for some time . i have got myself quite a proud collection with many more titles on my list ! 

the kindred although i have not as yet got a copy is high priority as all the old movies i didn ' t like back then , i now own and have now re-watched and think they are brilliant and the bits i do remember of the kindred are now driving me to want to get hold of a copy a . s . a . p . 

hurray for the 80 ' s and long live horror !  the filmmakers neglected to connect the dots--that is , the sequence of events and choices that led from charlie wilson and the anti-soviet mujaheddin to al qaeda and osama bin laden and eventually to 9 / 11 . the filmmakers of course neglect to tell us the back-story--why were the soviets in afghanistan ? --but that omission pales in comparison to their failure to reveal that support for islamicist extremists in afghanistan in the name of rabid anti-communism ultimately strengthened the hand of anti-western forces and was a big contributing factor to the mess that we find ourselves in today ( 9 / 11 , terrorist networks , a prolonged ground war in afghanistan , etc . ) . because these consequences are not spelled out , the movie leaves the viewer feeling sympathetic to mr . wilson ( hey , check out his latest projects on the internet ) instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to the best interests of his country and the west as a whole .  there ' s considerable amount of money behind this production , so the look of it is very good . it includes some interesting appearances by gilbert roland , eddie burns , and a brief cameo at the beginning by christopher lee . there are a few exciting gunfights , and a humorous bit or two - the satire on django , the man with no name , and sabata is amusing , especially when they are given the names of failed presidents of the mexico revolution . 

the trouble is , there isn ' t any purpose in satirizing the spaghetti western as is attempted here . the key element in the spaghettis is irony , which easily blends into comedy ; in fact the source of all spaghetti ' s is kurosawa ' s yojimbo , which is universally recognized as one of the great black comedies of all time , and most spaghettis easily slipped over the edge into real comedy of a very sophisticated variety . perhaps the best evidence of this is found in the trinity films , which are both openly spaghettis and openly slap-stick comedy . so why bother satirizing a genre that - by its very nature - satirizes itself ? consequently , i found the whole enterprise essentially unconvincing . none of these characters were people i would ever care about , the story was generically clichÃ© , and the production values only reflected the money involved , not the passion of the director . over all , a banal and futile effort to cash in on the phenomenon it mocks .  having had more than a few mates suggest i check rise of the footsoldier out , i eventually got round to it last night . undoubtedly the story colton leach has to tell ( and did so in his autobiography ) is a compelling tale of one mans ascent from terrace boot boy to connected underworld villain . this film sadly compromised in quality by miscasts , appalling accents and woeful acting . ricci harnett in the lead role of leach does a reasonable job of conveying the transition from thuggery to serious criminal but his accent is all over the place . as his voice provides the stories narration it is something that after ten minutes was driving me nuts . terry stone as tony tucker provided the unintentional comedy with an ill fitting wig ( or the worst barnett going ) dialogue that was so expletive riddled it bordered on juvenile and an over the top vehemence in line delivery reducing tucker to parody . what troubled me most about this film was that the events leading up to the shooting in rettenden , essex and the formative years of leach are of genuine interest to crime fans and fans of football hooliganism so , to have this story sabotaged by a lack of credible accents and acting left me feeling an opportunity had been missed . roland manookian and frank harper provide the films only source of authenticity . on the positive side some of the films pacing and construct flowed well and kept the attention . the violence was well choreographed and aside from an over reliance on projectile red syrup for blood spatterings was on the whole realistic . if you enjoyed the film then it is worth checking out essex boys telling a similar tale from fictionalised viewpoint and also featuring billy murray .  dirty war

emergency services struggle to cope when islamic terrorists detonate a so-called ' dirty bomb ' in the middle of london . 

daniel percival ' s frightening movie uses all available evidence to dramatize the possible effects of a radioactive explosion in the heart of the uk capital , using the kind of documentary-style realism which has distinguished this particular subgenre since the 1960 ' s . in essence , the film reveals a catalogue of flaws in the british government ' s current strategy for dealing with such terrorist outrages , and percival ' s carefully-honed script ( co-written by lizzie mickery ) vents its spleen against mealy-mouthed politicians who would rather maintain the economic status quo than tackle this issue head-on . the film covers all necessary bases , and makes the salient point that this kind of terrorism is practised by a tiny handful of fanatics who have tarnished the islamic faith with their reckless disregard for human life , though viewers won ' t be reassured by the subsequent scenes of devastation and horror . not merely a drama , the film acts as a warning against complacency . either that , or its just another post-9 / 11 scaremongering tactic . you be the judge . . .  happy days was one of my favorite shows when it aired in 1974 . but the critics were quick to show their ignorance combined with a total lack of a sense of humor by slamming this show because they thought it was a cheap attempt to cash-in on the success of american graffitti . 

there were some similarities between american graffitti and happy days . 

both opened with " rock around the clock " by bill haley & the comets . both took place in a bygone era and both featured ron howard as one of the leading roles . but there were also some major differences . while american graffitti took place in 1962 california and centered around a group of newly graduated high school students about to take that big step into adulthood , happy days took place in milwaulkee , wisconson and centered around a group of teenagers in high school , dealing with the joys and tribulations of adolescence . 

happy days originally opened with the juke box playing the original version of bill haley & the comets ' rock around the clock . but when oldies became hot , thanks to the success of american graffitti , , and the original 1954 version of rock around the clock , entered the billboard hot 100 and became a hit again in 1974 , royalty payments went through the roof . so a " remake " of the song ( the correct term is now " new stereo recording " ) was quickly substituted . 

the current theme song for happy days was then introduced for the second season if memory serves me right . 

fans and foes alike agree that this show is escapist . liberties were taken and details overlooked , making this show less than completely authentic . 

this is perfectly fine . happy days is supposed to be a comedy , not a history lesson . but occasionally the writers did sometimes stick their necks out by hitting on controversial topics . one episode centered around the cunninghams building of a fall out shelter . another episode was about a divorced woman moving into the neighborhood with a dream of starting a new life . the topic of prejudice was addressed when howard was invited to the wedding of an old army buddy who just happened to be black ( in an era when prejudice and discrimination was sadly an acceptable part of the american way of life ) . the issue of the draft even came up on a later episode ! 

the show as originally set in 1955 . one problem that was dealt wisely was with the cast . most of them were teenagers and as each year passed , it was obvious that they grew older so the series aged with the cast , moving the series out of the safe waters of the eisenhower years into the age of camelot , all the way with jfk and then into the turbulent later half of the 1960s . that , along with the writers running out of ideas , and later , cast members like ron howard leaving the series , wisely quitting while they were ahead , left me wishing that they had all done the right thing by pulling the plug on this show and quitting while they were ahead . that , along with the idol worshiping studio audience who just couldn ' t control themselves every time the great fonzie entered the scene , began to wear very thin very fast . 

this show originally portrayed the fabulous fifties as we like to remember that era . time heals wounds , you know . everything has its place and though i would prefer hearing the " original hit versions " over those " new stereo recordings " , those " new stereo recordings " worked very well on happy days . and this is where i find myself regretting my buying the dvd ! unlike the complete first season dvd , the original music on the complete second season , has been replaced with different music . while it is great that the original episodes were digitally restored to digital perfection , the removal of the original music destroyed what it was that made this show so much fun to watch !  the few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute boy scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes . when sharif or , please god , palance try their hand at fiery oratory , they sound like kurtz swallowing a bug . the displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of cuba replete with smiling fishies in the ocean , and a positively vaudevillian hypothesis on how the bay of pigs came to pass . what does that leave us with ? one comical dentistry scene ; a surfeit of uppity hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train ; and , just for kicks , a passel of homoeroticism that is not limited to castro ' s manic and unremitting cigar-fellatio . never trust a medved , but even a busted clock is right twice a day : this is a historically awful movie .  i found this film extremely disturbing . treadwell is delusional and disturbed , to the point of probably suffering from a mental illness . the footage shown is him and not an actor , but yet it is showing behaviour that ended in death . is it appropriate to show actual footage of a suicide ? let ' s not mince words . the film shows footage of behaviour that directly led to his death . 

for those who think that treadwell is some kind of hero , think again . the footage he shot is about him and not about the bears and foxes he claimed to be helping . he did no meaningful research into their habits or numbers and did nothing to actually protect them . all he did was run around in the bush and convince himself that he was better than everyone else . reality is , by helping to desensitize the animals to humans , he exposed them to great risk . his self indulgent behaviour not caused his own death , but also the death of his companion amy plus exposed his beloved bears and foxes to greater harm . 

but i ' m also concerned about werner herzog ' s actions in compiling this film the way he did . 

a friend and i have had a long argument about this film who loved this film . he believes that seriously disturbed people make for interesting subjects and he cites the movie downfall as an example . but in downfall they use actors . we didn ' t see the real madga goebells put cyanide capsules into her own children ' s mouths . 

there was something about using the real footage in grizzly man which reminded me of that horrible football stadium tragedy where people were being crushed to death and the photographers who could have helped , elected to simply keep recording the horror . 

herzog ' s film shows us that treadwell ' s footage is more about treadwell . but herzog has done the same . his own personality and opinions are aired in this documentary , which is supposedly about someone else . scenes such as the one where he listens to the tape are not necessary . we already knew what was on the tape because the coroner had told us . we didn ' t need herzog shedding a tear with one of treadwell ' s former girlfriends . it didn ' t add to the film . 

the film showed us that treadwell was very self-indulgent , but it also showed us that herzog is as well .  the texas revolution of 1835 to 1836 , including the periods preceding and immediately following , is depicted in this mediocre 3-hour made-for-television film , whose only redeeming value is bringing light and paying homage to stephen f . austin , the so-called " father of texas " whose life story had long been overshadowed by that of the legendary sam houston . the rest of the film is simply the usual " santa anna is a tyrant " storyline and with a weak attempt to show the mexican perspective with a fictional hispanic character displaying stereotypical latin machismo . combined with short low-budget battle scenes , such as the alamao and san jacinto , this film is recommended only for real history buffs who who do not come from mexico . to its credit , the mexican uniforms look accurate and the romantic subplot ( another love triangle ) doesn ' t take up too much screen time . overall , this movie depicts the violent secession movement by texas ' anglo-saxon racial minority to be a positive and just revolution against mexican tyranny as personified by the general antonio lopez de santa anna , the so-called " napoleon of the west " .  in a sense , this movie did not even compare to the novel . however , it was good to have a visual of what the congo looked like and also the natives if you are not good at visualizing as you read . i would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book . i hardly suggest even watching this film , let alone any other films based on this literary work . this movie ; and many others , did not fulfill this book . one important part that is missing from the movie is marlow ' s sense of how government of lack of there in africa was forming an early genocide . also in the movie , marlow and his companions didn ' t stop and get the note and wood . likewise , kurtz ' african mistress knocks marlow out towards the end of the story which has a major influence in the story but was not in the book . in the novel , kurtz died on the ship , however he died in his hut in the movie . the fiancÃ© ' s reaction to marlow ' s interpretation of kurtz ' last words also differed . this movie is only effective if you wish to visualize more clearly the novel .   " ashes of time " was an audacious project but ended up being a pretentious movie . this film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex manner . the plot of " ashes of time " is fairly simple and comes down to two words : " love triangle " . because of those " love triangles " crossing stories , jealousy , hate and love are the main dynamics displayed by the characters . the narrative part is seen through ou-yang feng ' s eyes ( leslie cheung ) . ou-yang feng lives in the desert , where he acts as middleman to various swordsmen and becomes the tool of destiny through which vengeance is achieved . unfortunately " ashes of time " fails in telling these simple stories of love and hate . wong kar-wai lost himself driven by a desire to make each frame of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience . in fact beside the casting of beautiful actors ( men and women ) everything else is a failure in this movie . dialogs are minimalists and not original at all . picture ' s quality is very much unequal , the editing is one of the worst ever seen ( at least by me ) in the " swordplay " genre and finally the filming of the rare sword fight is very confusing and unappealing . even the attempt of building artistic scenes is not always achieved : the so call erotic " women on a horse " scene is ridiculous , not erotic and useless . wong kar-wai wanted to deliver 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that a film is first about how a plot is told . by forgetting that he delivers an awkward movie that doesn ' t even fulfill its artistic objective .  this tale of the upper-classes getting their come-uppance and wallowing in their high-class misery is like a contemporary mid-sommerish version of an old joan crawford movie in which she suffered in mink . here , people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity . a well-heeled london solicitor , ( tom wilkinson ) , discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper ' s husband in a hit-and-run accident . he throws up , but otherwise his stiff-upper-lip hardly quavers . 

written and directed by julian fellowes , who won an oscar for writing " gosford park " , ( this is his directorial debut ) , from a novel by nigel balchin , it ' s quite comical although i am not sure how much of the comedy is intended . it ' s like a throw-back to british films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books or plays rather than like people might in real life . however , it ' s not all bad . wilkinson is terrific , even if you never believe in him as a person while emily watson , ( the adulterous wife ) , and rupert everett , ( the highly amoral high-class totty ) , are both very good at covering the cracks in the material . tony pierce-roberts ' cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear it ' s always good on the eye .  while this isn ' t one of miss davies ' very worst films , it is pretty bad . and it ' s sad that in a revisionist fashion , recent imdb raters have deliberately over-inflated the scores on some of her films to make up for her being slighted in the past--or so it seems . for years , conventional wisdom has been that davies was a terrible actress and only got the roles she got because her beau , william randolph hearst , bought her way into hollywood . this certainly is the image created in orson welles ' citizen kane . it is true that hearst did use his considerable wealth and clout to build davies ' career . with all this money , it ' s not surprising that she made some excellent films and it isn ' t surprising that people got snippy due to all the extra attention she got . sleeping with the man who finances your films is bound to get noticed . however , despite this edge , she also made a decent number of bad films and i think we really need balance when it comes to the scores of her movies . after all , no rational person could believe that as of today ( 1 / 5 / 08 ) , peg o ' my heart and two other davies films recently shown on turner classic movies ( the florodora girl and marianne ) deserved the exceptionally high scores--ranking them higher than such films as high noon , ben hur , the best years of our lives and all quiet on the western front ! ! in fact , marianne would now rank as the fifth best movie ever according to imdb with a score of 8 . 8 ! ! ! considering most people out there don ' t even know who marion davies was and most of her movies were financial disasters , this is a serious problem ! ! however , she was a much better actress than citizen kane implied and initially broke into films before she began sleeping with hearst . 

what sets peg o ' my heart apart from these two other movies , is that marianne and the florodora girl were pleasant little films--while peg o ' my heart is in some ways just terrible . much of the reason was the terrible miscasting of marion . while her french accent in marianne was cute , in peg her irish accent just sounded bizarre--not particularly irish . plus , and perhaps i ' m mistaken , but her continual use of the word ' ye ' makes her sound like she should be doing shakespeare , not a film set in 1933 ireland ! also , there was a bizarre insistence that marion should be the consummate multi-talented star--so they had her not just act but dance and sing . the singing actually fit the scripts in some of her films , but here it seemed out of place and seriously detracted from the film . it just seemed like you could almost hear hearst shouting out " see--she is a great actress---look at her sing and dance " . sadly , marion just looked uncomfortable and out of place in many of these scenes . but for me , the biggest problem was the idea of having 36 year-old marion playing such a youthful role . it was obvious that the character she played at the beginning of the film was supposed to be like the ones mary pickford played in the teens and twenties--complete with the pig tails and plucky attitude . miss pickford could carry off these roles even though she , too , wasn ' t a girl any more . but here , marion had put on a bit of weight and looked at least 30 . no offense--she looked fine for her age--but she did not look like a teen ! 

oddly , with the millions that hearts spent on marion ' s career , he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money on was a good script and one that fit marion ' s talents . believe me , i have rated several of her films very high ( i especially adore show people ) , but here she just couldn ' t help but flop--this film was a turkey .  recension : angels & demons

the movie is directed by ron howard . he has had also made famous movies like the da vinci code & cinderella men . he directed also the famous tv-series 24 . the most famous actors are tom hanks ( the da vinci code , the green mile , forrest gump , ) & ewan mcgregor ( cassandra ' s dream , moulin rouge , star wars : the phantom menace , ) . 

in the begin i was shocked because they changed the beginning from the movie so big . because they changed the father of vittoria vettra ( ayelet zurer ) in someone else , silvano bentivoglio ( camren argenziano ) . another change is that robert langdon ( tom hanks ) never goes to the cern . it was nice that they could film on location in the cern . 

then movie goes on , they are spectacular car races in rome . an i also like the part in chirstian archives very much when they destroy the work of galileo , it was funny . it was also funny that they where locked in the archives the second time they get in , robert langdon destroyed half of the archives and when they bust out , the electricity get onÂ

i found it very stupid that robert langdon not went in the helicopter , but that the camerlengo ( ewan mcgregor ) gets in alone , another detail is that in the movie the camerlengo is an adopted son from the pope . in the book he is the real son of the pope . 

when i should give the best acting performance then i should say pierfrancesco favino who plays inspector olivetti . the worst acting was from the assassin , who was played by nikolaj lie kaas , i think he was underachieving , because in adams apples he played faboulous . 

i think the whole movie is underachieving because director ron howard made some many stupid changes . i would rate the movie by 4 / 10 .  as a parent of two girls ( 14 and 11 ) i have grave doubts about this show and all the shows aimed at tweens . first , i am always amazed that the living conditions of drake / josh , zac / cody , hanna , carly , derek , sunny etc . always make most houses look tiny and cramped . most people work hard all day to pay for living quarters less than half the size yet on these shows nobody is going or coming from work , paying utility , rent , mortgage or insurance bills , mopping , sweeping , changing lightbulbs , fixing toilets , etc . just walking in and out ( and down the ubiquitous wide stairs that only exist on tv sets ) cracking jokes ( most of which involve lying and the hilarious results ) and shirking work . i think kids watching these will have unrealistic expectations on how hard they will work and how luxurious their lives will be . second , there is never an intact family , always a mom or dad but never both , who are always going on sexless dates but never seem to have any of the downside of divorce ( alimony , support , arguments ) . again , kids may get the impression that if mom / dad get divorced there will be fun fun fun ( actually mom or dad are often not around if that helps the plot ) . needless to say there is no mention of spirituality ( forget specific religion ) . finally there is a theme that troubles me . there are " nerds " that are good in school , " jocks " good in sports , " goody two shoes " as well . the protagonists are not good at school , sports , or charitable but make wisecracks about those who are . the message is don ' t be good at anything , just be one of the " nothings " who blend in cracking jokes . needless to say i give all these shows a zero and turn them off all the time and am just short of forbidding them in my house .  more suspenseful , more subtle , much , much more disturbing . . . .  tom is about to tuck into a delicious jerry sandwich when a huge bird of prey swoops down and flies off with his snack . not at all happy with having his sarnie stolen right from under his nose , tom takes off in hot pursuit , determined to retrieve his mousy morsel . 

as much as i love tom and jerry , i have got to say that this one is a bit of a stinker : the story is rather mundane ; it introduces a badly conceived peripheral character that lacks charm ; and it flogs the old ' dress the cartoon character up as a woman ' gag to death . 

in my opinion , ' flirty birdy ' rivals ' fraidy cat ' and ' mouse in manhattan ' for the title of weakest tom and jerry caper thus far .  a child-like puppeteer , for a public access children ' s show , goes over the deep end when he discovers kids he entertains at a hospital were victims of horrible abuse . this movie has some of the worst indescribably monstrous parents you could ever come across . not an exploitation film as much as an afterschool special on the dangers of child abuse . seemingly harmless , mr . rabby takes matters into his own hands when it seems the police are neutered by lack of evidence to convict loathsome parents of their terrible abuse towards their children . the children are emotionless and zombie-like ( . . due to the amount of abuse inflicted upon them ) , the parents loud , inconceivably harsh , contemptible , and belligerent . the mothers , in particular , are so obscene , you ' ll root for their execution . they are essentially miserable people taking out their frustrations on the kids . our detectives are a tired lot , frustrated with the whole judicial process , how police procedure is often unable to prosecute those who beat their kids into submission . while the crimes themselves are heinous , the film doesn ' t explicitly elaborate the grisly activity on screen . i ' d say the reason to see this is for tom basham ' s performance as the unbalanced man-child who slips into psychosis . there ' s quite a weird dinner table sequence between basham ' s mr . rabbey and his guardian shortly after he murdered the parents responsible for the death of their child , regarding how he lives in a fantasy and how what he had just done has left an indelible mark ( . . notice the changes in behavior , pretty impressive work , going from innocent to creepy ) . peter renaday is lt . hayes , the detective in charge of the homicides cases , expressing on his face the strain that is taking it ' s toll on him . there ' s an early performance by john ashton as detective matthews , always raising the ire of hayes because of his inability to follow directions , not to mention how opinionated he is regarding the parents abusing their kids . awkward laid-back bluesy score that seems improper for a film such as this . controversial conclusion establishing that even kids can only tolerate so much . a bit too slow moving for my tastes , but there ' s an effective use , i felt , of basham ' s eyes before he takes care of business , waiting patiently as he prepares to strike .  this film has some nice special effects , tearing apart the japanese archipelago to a degree that would humble godzilla . the two leads also put in above-par performances . apart from that , it is all a bit ropey in this understated disaster flick . the incongruities in the pacing are bizarre . at one point we have hokkaido sinking into the sea and pyroclastic snow falling on the rest of japan , while osaka is buried under an immense tsunami . yet elsewhere in the country , people are still strolling around sightseeing and licking ice-cream when another tsunami rolls in . . . kusanagi also manages to travel great distances without any hindrance , or even a crease in his cream shirt . other people turn up with burns , ripped clothes and mud-streaks on their faces . 

the japaneseness of the film is both touching and repugnant . kusanagi ' s sacrifice in his final evening with shibasaki is a touch of chivalry seldom seen in this genre these days . however , the ill-fated pms musings on the japanese psyche and the seduction of death , and the fact that japan is abandoned by everyone and has no friends in the last instance , hint at a darker paranoia that infects japanese concerns regarding their status in the world . 

sadly , the final sequence is a rip-off of armaggedon , edited with a cookie-cutter . 

finally , my own particular bug-bear - the heavy handed product placement for cigarettes . this time around , it is mad ( -or-is-he ? ) scientist toyokawa who gets to be the poster boy for japan tobacco . at one point , he manages to light up 5000 meters below the ocean surface , in a miniature sub the size of a phone box . gimme a break .  regardless of whether the predominant social message of this film - that vigilante justice is acceptable - is justifiable , i was more insulted by mcconaughey ' s closing statement . in a courtroom drama , the closing statement of the defence attorney is pretty much the crux of the film , and when the issue is as difficult to resolve as this one , the statement is really being delivered to the audience as well as the jury . this basically implies that the audience consider the rape of a white girl to be a more horrific crime than the rape of a black girl . i for one find this very insulting . as for the rest , i found the acting reasonable , with the exception of sandra bullock , who seems to be playing her usual bubbly self ( doesn ' t really work in a courtroom drama ) , but what ' s the point when the film ' s message is as poor as this one . it tells you that vigilante justice is fine , and accuses you of racism if you disagree .  i enjoyed oceans 11 , i thought it was quite enjoyable , helped by the performances and the direction . however , i was disappointed with this film . don ' t get me wrong , it is not a complete dud , thanks to the stellar performances from brad pitt , catherine zeta-jones , george clooney and matt damon especially and the efficient direction from steven soderbergh . however , the film really does suffer from truly lethargic pacing , some of the film was so slow i almost fell asleep between one key twist . second , the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up . the camera work wasn ' t as innovative as it was in the first movie either . whereas in the first movie , it was smooth and professional , it was jerky and awkward here , and the music wasn ' t particularly memorable . the screenplay also wasn ' t as witty or as fun , and the film felt anti-climatic . at the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy , despite the expert playing and direction . so much potential , but really a missed opportunity . 4 / 10 bethany cox since i ' m from norway ( one of the top ten ( or so ) richest countries in the world ) , it was much fun to watch how we use trucks from the 50ies and live in cottages from the medieval times . and since we have very strict laws when it comes to handguns , it was fun to see how much guns there actually were in norway during the five minutes of the shooting there . mr . direct-to-video even managed to bring his silencer on short notice , so he must have powerful friends in the customs . 

please do at least _some_ research before going to an " exotic " country , dudes -- you may hurt the feelings of old fans . 

sverre -- old fan with hurt feelings .  this movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone , such as the robe , quo vadis , and samson and delilah , unfortunately depict all pagans or anybody who isn ' t a jew or christian as morally depraved and decadent . the focus is only on biblical-related stories that ignore the world outside the bible . as far as they are concerned , nothing good came from pagan egypt , greece or rome . 

any movie that preaches about the " one true god " gives a short shift to freedom of religion . the movies ignore the fact that ancient judea ' s lack of religious freedom made it a fertile ground for religious extremism . most 1950s religious movies also overlook the loss of freedom the occurred after christians assumed political power in the 4th century .   ( there are spoilers ) usual slasher film with the story taking place in and around this god-forsaken mine outside the almost deserted town of sutterille . after receiving a letter map and gold nugget from her brother jared , shadrach smith , clair and her husband nick breman , carrie bradac & sean hines , drive to the village together with four other friends and armature gold-prospectors alx & tori , steve wastell & sangie , and hayden & rox ann , rick majeske & elina to stake their claim . 

it later turns out that the fact that jared disturbed the long-forgotten gold mine caused the ghost of the notorious jeremiah stone , vernon wells , to come back to life and with that restart his reign of terror . stone , or 49er , is about the most ridicules slasher / killer in motion picture history . stone looks like he was buried for years under a few tons of coal runs around with this hook slicing people in two . after doing in almost the entire cast local hermit aunt nelly , ( karen black ) , who ' s daughter eve ( alexandra ford ) was also one of stone ' s victims , tells those still alive that unless they return the gold back to the stone mine the crazed miner will never rest until he kills all those who still have it . 

aunt nelly is given just enough time to tell her story before she ' s turned into a human torch by stone and ends up jumping into a nearby stream . the movie goes on endlessly with the killer miner on the rampage looking like he ' s about as scary as burnt toast and just as dark . even those in the film seemed to show no real fear of him . in one scene when he broke into aunt nelly ' s house everyone inside all charged , instead of running away , him causing the ghost miner to lose his right arm ; stone spent the rest of the movie with a miner ' s pick attached to his " stump " . 

besides actress karen black the film " miners massacre " also has veteran actors john phillip law and richard lynch as the town sheriff murphy and old man prichard . passable stuff but nothing special the movie has a predictable ending with the entire gold mine going up in flames . the audience given a hint by the makers of " miners massacre " that the end to this mindless lunacy is nowhere in sight and may very well resurface in the very near future in a possible sequel , god help us all !  an unintentionally hilarious early talkie melodrama with kay francis as the countess balakireff chasing everything in pants . at the beginning of the film she " throws back " the stableboy for being too young before setting off for the chauffeur ! the high-toned english set she moves in is such a clichÃ©d bunch of harummpf-ers that it ' s ridiculous . but the topper is basil rathbone as an italian violinist with a chico marx accent ! " my violeen ! how weel i ever play eet again ! " " patreecia , my meelk is cold ! " it ' s campy beyond belief .  larry is a perfect example of the democratic party in the united states , of which he is a staunch member . king used to be somewhat fair and unbiased and had a variety of guests on . the party used to be centrist , too , but that was another era . now , like , larry , it ' s far left . 

at least 90 percent of all the guests on king ' s show in the past year or two are liberals who sit there and bash president bush and every conservative they can think of . . . . . night after night . bill mahar , one of the more viscous ones , is - and you can look this up - the most frequent guest in the history of king ' s tv show . you can count on other outspoken left wingers to be on king ' s show each week , but don ' t hold your breath waiting for a conservative . they are few and far between . 

king was also one of the innovators of the media overkill . that all began with the o . j . simpson trial . night after night after night that ' s all you ever saw back in the mid ' 90s . whatever latest gossip on anna nicole smith , or the petersen murder case , or paris hilton , britney spears or some other tabloid subject , you can bet larry will beat it to death . sadly , all the other networks do the same thing now . larry was a leader in that regard . 

king also has the nerve to sometimes give advice , such as on marriage . i am not kidding ; i ' ve heard him say it . the joke is that he has been married and divorced a half dozen times ! this man has few scruples , believe me . when it comes to morality , he is clueless . maybe that ' s why he has dr . phil on , to explain some facts of life to him regularly . larry will nod , but he doesn ' t understand any more than when billy graham used to talk to him . 

king also is becoming famous for the " softball " interview , meaning he asks no hard questions . that is a lot due to the fact that most his guests are of his political persuasion . people know being on king ' s show is liking having an hour public relations gig . 

what all this has meant is a serious decline in ratings the past five years . people see through him and his liberal-and-tabloid-tv mentality and switched over from king and cnn to fox news .  spoiler warning ! ! ! 

this is probably my least favourite cary grant film . i spent most of the time thinking : ignore him , leave him etc . is he trying to kill her ? should we assume that after the end , when he persuades her to return home with him , that he will kill her after all ? i see from checking in a couple of books that this is a reading that some viewers / critics have taken . finishing early is after all a more reasonable way to film a book , than to change the ending - and this is a more unreasonable change of ending than , for example , in altman ' s the long goodbye . unlike hitchcock ' s earlier example of making the murderer not the murderer because a star has been cast ( when gosford park refers to the lodger , ivor novello ' s murderous habits are not mentioned ) the book ' s ending is not definitely ruled out . 

in robin wood ' s hitchcock ' s films revisited , he writes : " as one mentally ' swiches ' from ending to ending , the significance of every scene changes , the apparent solidity of the narrative dissolves , the illusion of the fiction ' s ' reality ' disintegrates , the film becomes a ' modernist ' text in which the process of narrative is foregrounded . " i enjoy playing intellectual interpretation games as much as anyone else , but unless the film stands on a straightforward reading , then it fails . this one fails . even after considering the fatal glasses of milk that recur in a few hitchcock films . 

an annoying quibble . the year is 1941 . nothing in the film says that it is set in the past . beaky ( nigel bruce ) keeps his money in a paris bank , and goes there to do financial business ? does he not know that there is a war on ? indeed , were there still any flights from croydon airport ? is he on good terms with the nazis ? how come it is never suggested that the germans shot him as a spy or something . 

a curiosity . when johnnie and lina have dinner with isobel , the mystery writer , and her brother , the pathologist , there is a fifth person present , who is never explained nor introduced - a woman in a tuxedo . the credits say that she is nondas metcalf playing phyllis swinghurst . is this not an example of how lesbians were coded in ' 40s films ? are we to take her as isobel ' s lover ? the books that discuss overt and hidden gays / lesbians in hitchcock ( e . g . robin wood again ) do not include phyllis swinghurst .  one of the worst movies ever made . let ' s start with the superficial : joaquin phoenix is , first of all , too fat to be a rookie fireman . the nyfd does not recruit pillsbury dough boys . john travolta has a bad dye job , and the strange gleam in his eye throughout the movie made me think that he was on some sort of extended scientology bender . the plot hits on all the tropes and clichÃ©s of what the average joe believes life as a firefighter is really like : they all get drunk , get into fights , have a hard time expressing their emotions , their wives all stay at home crying , they all have father issues , everyone has a boston accent , et cetera . an execrable piece of schwarmerei that plays on our lingering cultural hero worship of firefighters after 9-11 -- which was , by the way , valid cultural hero worship . this film unfortunately presents no believable heroes to worship .  i ' ve read through a lot of the comments here about how this movie sticks to the book . . i don ' t think any of them have actually read it . edgar rice wrote about a dangerous african jungle and apes were killers and hunters . we know differently now and this movie portrays apes in a more modern view . i ' ve never seen a tarzan movie that even comes close to edgar ' s vision . maybe one day hollywood with trust talented and respected authors to tell the story . so , if you ' ve never read the book and enjoy a good story about feelings and a fluffy bunny view of wild animals , maybe a good cry , see the movie . i hope john carter of mars get ' s more respect than tarzan has . we miss ya , edgar !  the pace of this movie is quite slow . it takes about 70 minutes to get katie to china ( which we know that she will ) and leaves 30 minutes to wrap things up . the storyline is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes . nothing surprises you . i guess that the movie is a coming of age movie but the movie is full of stereotypes that are quite over the top : 

katie - a beauty that realizes that looks , boys and shopping isn ' t everything . she realizes that she can " feel " and " see the real world " . touching . 

the mother - high strung , nervous , screaming mother ( wow very innovative ) that need taking care of by a strong man . 

the father - patient and always understanding and takes care of the incapable woman . 

the boyfriend that only wants to get into her pants . 

the comedian clown chinese guy that doesn ' t know how to speak english properly and made a laughing stock . thought hollywood dropped those characters in the mid fifties . 

the nurse that at times knows everything how to get around in china that in the next moment is a carbon copy of the mother i . e . a woman who cant handle the situation or knows anything . 

the deformed chinese girl that with the help of us westerns get help and become a beautiful girl . because in china ( a third world country according to the film ) don ' t have anything and hence needs our charity . gah , wake up and smell what you are shoveling . 

sure that there are some poverty in china but the portrayal of the aid from western countries ( read usa ) is so shallow and happy ending-ish that it is sad and revolting . shanghai ( where the movie is set ) is the most expanding and evolving city in the world at the moment . 

the chinese father that is so nice and goodhearted that in the end has one wish . . . to be a cowboy with a white hat . . . 

the teacher ( sean astin ) that has this really heart ripping story ( not ) that he tells without feel . why sean ? why ! ? 

etc etc . it is difficult to actually finding a " real " person in the entire movie . 

this is nothing but a feel good movie for americans below age 15 . if you want to learn anything about the world watch e . g . hotel rwanda instead . for a better life story or coming of age movie i suggest you watch the italian " cinema paradiso " that won the best foreign film academy reward some years back . 

the only nice thing in the movie were the small town sceneries that truly capture some ( not all ) of the beautiful chinese country side . i have been there and seen some of it .  `it ' s as if this town has the power to suck your brain right out of your head . ' -patti

patti ( christina ricci ) is a sarcastic teenaged girl , bored with her all-too-average little town . bored that is until a woman is kidnapped and she finds what she believes to be clues to the poor lady ' s whereabouts . now , with the help of her precious cat `d . c . ' and an inept fbi agent ( doug e . doug ) she must find her . 

that darn cat is a bad movie . it is quite foolish and it has humor that often falls quite flat . there are , however , a few buds of talent in it . doug e . doug was good in cool runnings . his performance as `senga ' was really funny . here he is wasted as the bumbling fbi agent . he does have a good scene when he imitates the cat , though . micheal mckean plays patti ' s father . his character must be the most understanding parent to ever live . this poor guy has his expensive cigar crushed , gets arrested for picking up his own cat , and gets bitched-at by his snippy wife and still doesn ' t get angry at his daughter for causing all of his troubles . i wish my old man was like that . the only real good performance is christina ricci ' s . she entertaining as the ever-annoyed patti , but her occasional very bad dialogue pulls her performance down . you might also recognize peter boyle ( young frankenstein , everybody loves raymond ) , the old lady from wings and cliff from cheers , in this movie . this is a movie that all these actors would probably like to forget . even the cat isn ' t very good . . . i really can ' t recommend 1997 ' s that darn cat . some young children ( under 8 ) might enjoy it a bit , but every one else should look elsewhere . if you ' re looking for a good christina ricci movie , i suggest addams family values , the opposite of sex or sleepy hollow . if a fun family film is what you ' re after , try snow day , instead . 

 the only thing romantic about this movie is the pain and anguish of romance . if you are expecting this cinematic adaptation of another nicholas sparks novel to follow the surefire formula of previous films , such as " message in a bottle , " " nights at rodanthe , " and " a walk to remember , " think again . nobody dies from an accident trying to save somebody else and the romance here doesn ' t transform these characters . if anything , it makes them even more miserable than they were . 

a soft-spoken special forces army sergeant , john tyree ( channing tatum of " g . i . joe " ) , has a memorable two-week fling while on leave from the military with an impressionable college girl , savannah curtis ( radiant amanda seyfriend of " mamma mia " ) , who is spending spring break in south carolina . savannah doesn ' t drink , smoke , but she tells john that her head is filled with profanity . inevitably , john and savannah topple madly in love with each other and launch an endless exchange letters of love letters that are sleep-inducing by any standard . tyree is off in the world serving the military in some godforsaken corner of the globe while she is away at college perusing his letters in class . just as they are getting hot and heavy between them , suicidal terrorists crash planes into the world trade center . john reenlists along with his buddies in a wave of patriotism without discussing the option with savannah . 

meanwhile , another guy , shaggy but likable family friend tim ( henry thomas of " e . t . : the extra-terrestrial " ) who has a motherless , autistic child named alan becomes the object of savannah ' s sentiment . she is the kind of girl who helps build houses for the less fortunate and wants to start a summer horse ranch for autistic children . she delays what seems forever before she finally contacts tyree with the eponymous letter . indeed , she dumps him for a man with a disease ! later , she confesses to john that she knew the sound of his voice would have broken her resolve to marry tim , so she doesn ' t make that fateful call . predictably , john agonizes over savannah ' s lack of communication . during a routine mission , our hero takes a couple of terrorist bullets in the back and winds up in germany . while all this is transpiring , tyree is trying to come to terms with his own coin-collecting father , mr . tyree ( richard jenkins of " step brothers " ) , who suffers from asperger ' s syndrome . it seems that his father is on his last legs after john gets out of the hospital . the lead female character lacks a shred of respect and her betrayal of tyree amounts to a pretty low blow . tyree , his father , and tyree ' s commander , keith robinson , are the only sympathetic characters in this long distance epistolary romance . 

 " dear john " gives new meaning to lethargic love stories . yuck !  though stephen gyllenhaal is a good tv director with a few good full-length to his credit , " homegrown " is just a mess in its script and direction . despite performances from billy bob thorton , john lithgow , kelly lynch , jon bon jovi , jamie lee curtis , and ted danson , a cast this good couldn ' t save the film . 

gyllenhaalics will know that jake and maggie are in the film but you don ' t see jake very well and maggie ' s only in it for 30 seconds as babysitter tipping off lithgow ' s character about a bust . it ' s not even a lowbrow pot comedy as the film was intended to be . it just wasn ' t funny .  well , how to make a movie as provocative as possible ? this cartoonishly straight shocker tries by having two low-life paris women ( one prostitute , one recently raped ex-porn actress , no less ) lash out and go on a national sex-and-killing spree- of men in particular . 

very short running time gives you a hint of the experimental nature of this violently hardcore " thelma & louise " - but it ' s done completely without irony or contemplation for any possible feminist message . . . and since we don ' t get very close to the protagonists , the violence actually feels muted and numbing- and maybe that ' s a good thing . 

as a liberal advocate of freedom of expression , i always welcome when the " serious " movie industry dares to contain full-on sex scenes . but the question is : does it work for the movie as a whole ? is it any good ? here , not very , although we ' re given a new meaning to the phrase " a shot in the ass " ! 

3 out of 10 from ozjeppe i ' m a huge fan of both emily watson ( breaking the waves ) and tom wilkinson ( normal ) and was amused to see them upstaged by rupert everett ( dellamorte dellamore ) in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more . the too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid , infinitely entitled , worthless son of a rich lord are spot-on and entertaining . but for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone . the music was annoyingly movie-of-the-week quality , and the voice-over jarring and totally unnecessary . clearly the work of a first-time director with a small budget who either lacked or didn ' t sufficiently heed good advice . too bad . 

i can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end , and vice-versa , so there is some sort of character arc , at least in terms of perception . for example , watson ' s character , while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man , began to grate on me near the end , particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions , and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat , with no asking of permission , no apologies offered . and i went from disliking wilkinson ' s control freak / moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change ( unlike his wife ) . 

this movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a " love story " or " steel magnolias " illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact , so i was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed ( was it the lord driving the car ? the lord ' s dog ? ) . the scene where the lord visits wilkinson and relates how brave watson is , the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for , florence nightingale incarnate , etc . was ok until he started over-the-top sobbing like a baby . good god ! if you ask me she ' s just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands , and so she drives her hard working , well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama . her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life ; the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach . 

look , everyone would have been better off if wilkinson had just left her for his secretary , who seemed to appreciate him for who he was . instead he acted like an abused dog , his open craving for his wife ' s affection increasing with every kick she gives him . i ' m not anti pc or anything , it just didn ' t ring true , even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face . the ending for me was ( and not the director ' s intention i am certain ) depressing . the movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just don ' t belong together , so i found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing . i ' m not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story , it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed . is that asking too much ? 

my score : 4 / 10 i am partly a fan of miyazaki ' s work . i say " partly " because most of his films fall into two categories : brilliant , and boring . sadly this film falls into the later category . 

this film suffers from the same fundamental problems as miyazaki ' s recent film " howl ' s moving castle " . an intriguing premise is set up , but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it . 

the first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world the story is set in , and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold . from then on things go down hill . the middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinly-veiled eco-propaganda , and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of japanese animated films . 

overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators . what is left is something which is visually stunning ( although sadly the version i saw was an nth-generation copy , with poor colour - which gives rise to the common myth that nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying ) , but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused .  from time to time it ' s very advisable for the aristocracy to watch some silent film about the harsh life of the common people in order to remind themselves of the privileges and the comfortable life that they have enjoyed since the beginning of mankind or even before in comparison with the complicated and hard work that common people have to endure everyday since the aristocrats rule the world . 

and that ' s what happens in " the love light " , the first film directed by dame france marion who will be famous afterwards in the silent and talkie world thanks overall to her work as a screenwriter ; better for her , certainly , because her career as a film director doesn ' t impress this german count . 

the film tells the story of dame angela carlotti ( dame mary pickford ) a merry italian girl who lives surrounded by a " picturesque squalor " ( an important difference of opinion between upper and low classes ; aristocrats prefers to live surrounded by " picturesque luxury " ) ; she has two brothers and a secret admirer but all she gives him in return is indifference . destiny begins to work hard and pretty soon war is declared and dame angela ' s two brothers enlist and in the next reel both are dead . but destiny is even crueller and dame angela meanwhile falls in love with a german ! ! and to make things worse , she doesn ' t know that her teutonic sweetie is a spy and that the light signals that she sends to him every night from the lighthouse she maintains thinking that is a love signal , don ' t mean " ich liebe dich " but " sink any damn italian boat at sea " 

fortunately for dame angela , pretty soon her sweetie german spy will be found by the neighbours in her house in which she was hiding him ( a not strange fact , indeed , because it is not an easy task for a german to go unnoticed ) but the german spy will prefer to die before being captured by those italians . 

from that german love , a half-teutonic baby will born ( the wicked destiny at full speed ) but a greedy neighbour who has a particular idea of motherhood will carry away her son with the consent of a catholic nun who has taken the council of trent to extremes a fact that will put dame angela at the verge of insanity . 

but meanwhile dame angela ' s secret admirer has returned from the war and you can think that finally dame angela ' s sorrowful life will improve ; a tremendous mistake because destiny has in store for her that the returned soldier is blind . but as they say in germany , it may be a blessing in disguise and finally dame angela will recover her son and will start a new life with her blind sweetie in a poor italian village in what it is supposed to be a happy ending for the common people . 

as this german count said before , it was much better for dame frances marion that she continued her career as a screenwriter , because as can be seen in " the love light " , she had a lot of imagination to invent incredible stories , ja wohl ! but a completely different subject is to direct films and her silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm in spite of the effort of dame pickford to involve the audience with her many disgraces . the nonexistent film narrative causes indifference in the spectator making this the kind of film where only dame pickford herself provides the interest and not her circumstances . 

and now , if you ' ll allow me , i must temporarily take my leave because this german count must send morse signals from the schloss north tower to one of his teutonic rich heiress .  los angeles , 1976 . indie film brat john carpenter , fresh out of film school and with one film - his class project ' s no-budget spoof of 2001 called dark star - under his belt , finishes a gritty actioner called assault on precinct 13 . the story of an almost deserted police station under siege by an unseen la gang , it was a minor hit on the drive-in circuit and garnered small praise from the few critics who cared , but it hardly set the film world on fire , unlike carpenter ' s follow-up smash halloween ( 1978 ) . on precinct , carpenter was still learning how to exploit his almost non-existent budget by using lower-shelf actors , keeping the action to the one hellishly small location , and moving the film along at a tight pace with a combination of editing , intelligent camera work and switched-on genre savvy . 

no-one wants or needs to be hungry in hollywood anymore , particularly if the week ' s catering bill on the 2005 version of assault on precinct 13 is more than the entire cost of the original . it does translate into a certain kind of laziness on a filmmaker ' s part - you have a stupidly large union crew , a studio and a marketing firm all doing your thinking for you . which is why twenty years after watching carpenter ' s film i can still see every glorious moment , from the small girl gunned down in cold blood while buying an ice cream , to the relentless pounding synth score . a week after assault 2005 , i remember larry fishburne ' s unmoving ping pong ball eyes and little else . 

 " forgettable popcorn actioner " fits the top of the poster perfectly . it ' s new years eve at precinct 13 , a station closing down with a skeleton staff to see in its final hours . on call is jake roenick ( ethan hawke ) , an ex-narc now deeply troubled and hopped up on jack daniels and seconol after his partners were iced in the opening scene ; iris ( the sopranos ' drea de matteo ) , a nympho with a thing for criminal types , and jasper ( brian dennehy ) , a crusty old timer one scotch away from retirement . as in carpenter ' s assault . . . , a bus with four heavy-duty criminals is rerouted to the precinct . all boozy eyes are on gangster kingpin bishop ( fishburne , still beefed-up from his time in the matrix ) who has narrowly survived an assassination attempt from an undercover cop and plans to blow the lid on the endemic corruption in the organized crime unit led by marcus duvall ( a tired-looking gabriel byrne ) . soon the phones are out , the power lines are down , and both crims and police find themselves heavily armed with a serious police arsenal and consumed with paranoia while waging war against a task force of duvall ' s corrupt cops sporting white balaclavas , bullet vests , infra-red bazookas and more high-tech gear than the skywalker ranch . this , we ' re expected to believe as the helicopters buzz around the top of the police station shooting rockets into windows , is a clandestine operation to cover duvall ' s tracks . he may as well have taken out billboards on hollywood boulevard . 

as with the recent seventies genre reworking dawn of the dead , assault 2005 takes the barest plot essentials of john carpenter ' s original and , to quote the seventies , " does it ' s own thing , man " . the main question is - why bother ? john carpenter ' s 1976 is a cult favorite among genre buffs , but is hardly branded in the public ' s collective consciousness . carpenter himself was busy reworking howard hawks ' classic western rio bravo into a tight , claustrophobic urban thriller for only $ 20 , 000 . french wunderkind director and rap producer jean-francois richet , a self-professed fan of john carpenter ' s work , seems less concerned with making an homage to either hawks or jc - although the script is peppered with references to cowboys and injuns - and seems intent on squeezing in as much flash and firepower as the multi-million dollar budget can withstand . the result : some tense moments with hand-held pov cameras , an unexpectedly high ( and bloody ) body count , a few neat plot twists , but essentially a b-grade urban actioner with a much inflated price tag . as for name-checking carpenter , it ' s pure conceit on the part of the filmmakers that doesn ' t pay off . 

to monsieur richet , i say bon voyage , and i wish you luck on your music career .  jack lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen . he could effortlessly switch from dramatic roles to comedic with ease , making most of his peers green with envy . while his performance in " save the tiger " is oscar-worthy , i feel it was given to him as he had missed out on his other opportunities to win the award due to other , better roles that had preceded this current one . 

this is also one of those pretentious movies that comes out to basically showcase the talent of the cast , or in this case , one particular member . it ' s too bad the screenwriter ' s output didn ' t match that of lemmon ' s . don ' t waste your time with this one .  

summary : not worth the film

as an avid gone with the wind fan , i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters . luckily , the film on its own was a wonderful piece . when the book scarlett came out , i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together . while the book lacks any true quality , it remains a good story , and , as long as i was able to separate it from the original , was and still is enjoyable . however , i consider the six hours i spent watching the " scarlett " miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life . discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in margaret mitchell ' s book , this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape , mistrust , murder , and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from . the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film , and even carried through in the second book , and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character . in the novel , scarlett o ' hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family . after coming to an " arrangement " with rhett , she agrees to leave , and proceeds to reconnect with her o ' hara relatives in savannah . eventually , she accompanies her cousin colum , a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood , to ireland , to further explore her family ' s " roots that go deep , " and is eventually named " the o ' hara , " the head of the family . while her duties as the o ' hara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara , scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners , and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties . she , having been scorned by rhett time and time again , eventually agrees to marry luke , the earl of fenton , until rhett comes along in a clichÃ©d " night-on-white-horse " - type of a rescue . the " scarlett " miniseries fails even to do this justice . raped by her fiancÃ© and scorned by her family , the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed . 

i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision . 

 earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust . well , parts of the earth , because somewhere in italy , a band of purebred survivors--those without radioactive contamination--are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds , waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood . the final executioner is the story of one of their would be victims , alan ( william mang , who looks , not surprisingly , a lot like kurt russell ) , and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters , who are led by edra ( marina costa ) and erasmus ( harrison muller jr . ) . alan has been trained to kill by former nypd cop sam ( woody strode ) who mostly hangs around giving his pupil moral support and mooching for tinned meat . strode is by far the best thing about the film , though he doesn ' t look at all well and only appears for about a third of the running time . as for the story , it ' s a blending of elements from better films and stories , including ten little indians , the most dangerous game , and escape from new york . the final executioner moves along at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminate action fans .  any chance to see katharine hepburn in something i haven ' t seen or from her early movie career is a treat , and on that level the film is amusing , but she ' s horrible miscast as a hill billy . her famous new england enunciation slips through , making lines like , " i ' d better rustle up some vittles " pretty ludicrous . she ' s so pretty and so young it almost overcomes this major flaw . the story is an old fashioned melodrama , and there fore , a younger generation may think this pretty corny stuff , but this was the staple of american entertainment well into the 1940 ' s . it has its moments , but you might need to be a die-hard movie buff to appreciate it .  i have been a fan of the carpenters for a long time , read the biography , watched the specials , and saw the karen carpenter story . this movie really didn ' t show the real karen carpenter . in the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner ( except for one girl friend ) . the real karen carpenter was much different . she was outgoing and friendly . she had lots of friends , especially olive newton-john . the movie doesn ' t even show karen ' s attempts for a solo album and her meeting phil ramone and his wife itchy " karen " . itchy knew the real karen carpenter in new york . when karen was in new york , she did see a psychologist , but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room . also , karen was taking pills to increase her thyroid , so she could loss weight , but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too . also , the karen ' s husband in the movie is named bob knight , but in real life was named tom burris . also , karen wasn ' t divorced from tom , but only separated . karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died . also , agnes found karen naked in the closet unciousness , unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white . the music was very good . that was the only thing i would recommend on seeing it .  rita hayworth plays a brooklyn nightclub dancer named rusty who specializes in cheesecake chorus revues ; she manages to get herself on the cover of a national fashion magazine , but her impending success as a solo ( with romantic offers all around ) has smitten boss gene kelly chomping at the bit . terribly tired piece of technicolor cotton candy , with unmemorable musical sketches ( the two worst of which are irrelevant flashbacks to the 1890s , with hayworth portraying her own grandmother ) . kelly , as always , dances well but acts with false sincerity ; when he ' s serious , he ' s insufferable , and the rest of the time he ' s flying on adrenaline . the script is a lead weight , not even giving supporting players phil silvers and eve arden any good lines . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  a young doctor and his wife are suddenly expecting a child . both are disturbed about a two hour memory lapse on the night of conception . interesting twist on an hackneyed story . very good f / x and interesting editing . jillian mcwhirter is outstanding in a cast that features arnold vosloo , wilford brimley and brad dourif . brimley brings normalcy to the outlandish . kudos to director brian yuzna .  you can ' t really blame the movie maker for glorifying che because the industry is all about money . most of the stories you hear about this " freedom fighter " are absolute tripe fabricated by the communist cuban government after che ' s death . che was a murdering scumbag from day one . here ' s a list of the great things che did for cuba 1 ) executed thousands of innocent cuban men , women , and children to satisfy his lust for power . 

2 ) destroyed cuba ' s economy and good standing with the rest of the world . the cuban peso used to be equal with the american dollar . now it ' s basically worthless . 

3 ) continually failed at all things that involved diplomacy , economy , and the military . he never made it past his first year in medical school , and he was only in one real battle , in which he surrendered with a fully loaded gun . 

4 ) he took over the largest estate in cuba to set up for himself . he had a yacht , a 60 " custom made tv from america , a swimming pool , and a view of the ocean . so much for shunning the materialist life style . 

cuba today is an absolutely destitute country , and you have no one but che and the castro brothers to thank for it . if you go to cuba today you will not be allowed out of the tourist areas . if you did manage to get out of what you ' re meant to see , you would find slums , beggars , and prostitutes . 

if you think any of what i ' m saying is untrue then go do some studying . compare cuban exports from 1950 / 60 to those of today ; talk with people who survived or who had parents in the so called cuban " revolution " of the 1960 ' s ; read all of the reports of murdered innocents ; read the reports from people who served under che and castro and fled because of what an evil , disgusting human being he was . 

and please , please , always remember to read or watch everything objectively . stop taking everything at face value and think about it .  i was sorely disappointed in this movie . twice i was temped to walk out because segments of the movie were so demoralizing and depressing . the movie has elements that allude to all the seamy things in life ( pornography , murder , suicide , fornication , hatred , gang warfare ) . the graphic nature of the violence in this movie was particularly disturbing . 

and richard dutcher does a great disservice to the lds church in portraying missionary attitudes , commitment , spirituality , and obedience as unfocused and lackadaisical . 

my biggest objection to this movie , however , was that it is the exact opposite of a feel-good movie . 

dutcher ' s god ' s army one was okay . his brigham city was quite good . this movie , in terms of casting , acting , and drama was his best . but in terms of being inspiring or uplifting it was as awful as it could be . in fact , this movie so demoralized me that i am sorry i went . i have lost interest in ever again supporting dutcher in an lds-themed movie with a ticket purchase .  a film by almodovar- sends a tingle down my spine every time . the capitalized print which opens the spanish auteur ' s latest feature instantly induces memories of salacious nuns , gentle necrophiliacs , wisecracking transsexualsÂand i haven ' t even got as far as the infant-terrible ' s critically reviled early work . and after a beautiful opening montage , with the camera roving across a wind-swept graveyard animated by a hoard of widows feverishly scrubbing tombstones , i thought pedro had me again under his wicked spell . 

yet once my nostalgia had subsided , there was very little to fill its place . for a director who revels in bringing humanity to assassins and rapists , he does a very poor job at finding any emotional depth or endearing quality in his women . penelope cruz is raimunda , a headstrong housewife whose life is complicated by her daughter ' s accidental killing of her abusive husband . thankfully she lives in almodovar ' s spain where your friends will quite happily help to dispose of a corpse for the offer of a round of cocktails . add to the melting-pot the ghost of raimunda ' s mother and a host of other eccentrically warm-hearted matriarchs . " volver " means literally to return , and pedro does appear to be recycling old material . the sub-plot of incest feels as though it were tacked-on as the obligatory " taboo " . instead of commenting on or subverting the issue , as with his treatment of paedophilia in bad education , it feels forced and unconvincing amid the film ' s chick-flick sentimentality . i suggest almodovar call his next film salir ( to move on ) .  spoiler - this film gives away plot points and discusses the ending . i hated this film - mostly for political reasons , but also for moral and aesthetic reasons . politically , this film glorified war and military technology - blowing things up real good . we are led to cheer as the music swells and the afghans use our weapons to blow the ruskies to bits . and no u . s . soldiers put their lives on the line - so it ' s a fun war . aesthetically , there isn ' t a touch of real human emotion in the film , just smug , privileged people being sarcastic , feeling superior , and doing whatever they want regardless of the consequences . and speaking of consequences , the film only makes a few small hits at what the arming of the afghans actually led to . i had read an earlier draft of this script , and it ended on 9 / 11 - with charlie wilson realizing that things had gone horribly wrong . but that wouldn ' t leave the audience feeling good . this is a feel good movie about killing ruskies . and it made me sick .  i love musicals , all of them , from joyous oklahoma , to poignant porgy and bess , to the touching romantic " damn yankees . " and i know most of the songs , sometimes singing them spontaneously , with a crowd or humming them alone . 

in a " real " musical , as differentiated from this vaudeville show , every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment . it is an expression of sadness , regret , love , joy or exaltation--a natural extension where mere words fail . so , in guys and dolls , " my time of day " describes the adventurous life of sky masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman . every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood , or develops a character , creating a phantasmagoria of place , turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of song . 

for this lover of the broadway musical , and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the 20th century , mama mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre . there , the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate , often delightful , plot lines . while here , the songs , simply picked up from a collection , only interfered with the shaky premise of the film . 

perhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of 20th century musicals . they have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love , as achieved in " sweet charity . " 

let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review . perhaps , another day , another mood , i could have gotten into it , and not have been so critical in this review . 

but i can ' t help but imagining what richard roger , oscar hammerstein , cole porter , irving berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise . i think about it , while the memories of seeing this film is fresh , and i can not help but to mourn the great loss .   " flashdance " meets " meatballs iii " or maybe it should just be called " meatballs iv " . this is my friend wesley ' s all-time favorite movie , largely because he still has a thing about j . v . cheerleaders . as someone once said : " this is fine-more than fine-but as you get older you need to branch out . whether you want to or not , society demands it " . 

 " gimme an f " has cinema ' s greatest j . v . cheerleader mary ann ( played by beth miller ) , who looks like a sweet-faced alicia silverstone from before her " clueless " days . wesley hates miller ' s other film , the horrific " teen wolf too " made three years later , where she plays a fickle southern belle much like martha smith ' s character in " animal house " . personally i admire miller ' s range as the two characters could not be more different and she is convincing as both . 

anyway , mary ann is a naÃ¯ve novice cheerleader from moline ( a member of " the lucky ducks " squad ) who comes to camp beaverview for cheerleading instruction . she ' s befriended by jenna ( karen lee kelly ) , the leader of the tough girl squad-appropriately named " the demons " . jenna becomes protective of mary ann after her main rival takes an instant dislike to mary ann . 

later mary ann gets a crush on tommy hamilton , the head instructor . tommy is spending his summer wrestling with the dilemma of having to grow up and move on , which is a problem as his only skills are teaching cheerleading and performing elaborate dance routines in the shower , for the enjoyment of viewers who get off on that sort of thing . phoebe ( daphne ashbrook ) is tommy ' s long-suffering girlfriend , she has a well-adjusted attitude and an experienced perspective . she even tolerates tommy ' s flirtation with mary ann-trusting that tommy will not actually take advantage of young mary ann . 

while these four characters are solid and their relationships have a nice charm , the supporting cast is almost as weak as the material they have to work with . which is a shame because had they brought some actual comic relief to the production it would have been a decent film . jennifer cooke plays pam , a social climbing and terminally peppy instructor who is carrying on with camp ' s money-hungry owner bucky . and there is another couple with a thing for the characters from " mad max " . since nothing is very funny you are left with only a cute semi-romance and some great dance routines . 

an attempt is made to create some suspense by slowly leading up a final competition but unless this is your first movie experience the outcome is never in doubt . and there is a back-story about some japanese businessmen bucky wants to get money from , but it goes nowhere dramatically or comically . 

then again , what do i know ? i ' m only a child .  this movie may bear some historical importance , and it sure seems astonishing how well the facts are together , the setting , the rocket , the space suits , the surface of the moon , all scream " a classic " - but in the end , the result makes a pretty dull movie for todays eyes , and the 50ies tech scenes you might hope for in a movie like this are by far not enough to reward sitting through all the tacky dialog and predictable plot developments . the characters and plot may reward a scientific sociological analysis , but bear too little entertainment value many times . 

much of this movie seems like a good movie for nine-year-olds . the mature themes , the human drama and the violence are kept to a level suitale for children as well . 

the images of the earth and the moon seen from space may actually be more accurate than the ones in " 2001 " , but so what if their use is dramatically inefficient . especially 2001 may seem like a stretched out meditation over themes of this movie , and , has star wars not somehow modelled it ' s space-scrolling opening titles on the opening titles of this film ? but then again - the inheritance is marginal . 

if its a real groundbreaking and mega-influential mature 1950ies sci-fi classic you are looking for however , check out " forbidden planet " .  fellow giallo-fanatics : beware and / or proceed with caution for this movie isn ' t exactly what it appears to be . it surely looks like a giallo , with its juicy vhs cover ( showing a busty naked girl and a big bloodied knife ) , rhythmic title and the names of two veteran italian actors in the cast ( john phillip & fernando rey ) , but it ' s basically just an erotic thriller without much of a plot . the version i watched is presumably harshly censored Â with a running time of barely 77 minutes Â but then still there ' s a severe lack of suspense , character development and most of all sadistic ( and typically giallo ) carnage . " eyes behind the wall " can briefly be summarized as the gathering of a bunch of perverted characters and the extended depiction of their sexuality issues . it ' s an interesting effort notwithstanding , because writer / director giuliano petrelli ( his only film ) clearly attempted to do something special , but the overall result is unsatisfying and regrettably tame . inspired by hitchcock ' s " rear window " , the main character is a frustrated elderly and wheelchair-bound writer . he and his much younger lover get their sexual kicks from spying on the single male tenant living across the road . the tenant , respectively , likes to perform gym exercises around the house whilst being naked and clearly has bisexual desires . wheelchair guy sends his wife over and they have sex . then , there ' s also ottavio the butler who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls . are there any normal characters in the story ? well no , of course not ! the film benefices from a continuously ominous atmosphere , with a moody soundtrack and nifty photography , but none of it ever leads anywhere so it ' s all just sleaze & sex without significance . there ' s a truly bizarre twist / revelation at the end of the story , but it comes too late and too randomly to boost up the overall quality . not recommended to fans of italian horror / cult cinema , but maybe it is great viewing for psychology students , to analyze the characters freud-style .  star rating : * * * * * saturday night * * * * friday night * * * friday morning * * sunday night * monday morning 

danny ( mel raido ) is a lonely factory worker who tries to get by with his job and to be a good dad to his two daughters after a messy divorce from their mother ( maxine peake . ) but after an altercation with said daughters present at a working men ' s club , he uses a trip to their dance class to take a glance at louis ( colin salmon ) and his gang of hard men who train in the boxing gym / free weights section there and to train himself into a tougher , more assertive person . before long he ' s taken the philosophies of louis to heart and has joined him as a nightclub doorman as the 80s disco faze kicks in . . . but when associate sparky ( scott williams ) tries to do a sideline in drug dealing , everything turns pear shaped . 

as robert de niro once stated in the film a bronx tale ' there ' s no bigger tragedy than wasted talent . ' the writer of clubbed had a good idea and a talent to make it into some sort of film . . . but without the ability , it seems , to put it all together into some sort of coherent film . 

as a brummie , some of the filming locations ( especially a scene at the end outside the ring o ' bells pub in moseley ! ) were quite easy and fun to spot . . . but the dour look of the cinematography is really a downer on things . some really poor acting , for instance lead actor raido with an indecipherable accent that ' s all over the place , and a hammy script with some misfiring dialogue are bigger problems for the film though . more established actors like peake and even telly favourite neil morressey are sidelined to very small supporting parts , while the disastrous raido and ronnie fox ' s lame villain take centre stage . williams does a poor man ' s sick boy from trainspotting impression , leaving salmon and shaun parkes seemingly the only performers left with any integrity from the whole thing , as the excessive , blood splattered violence ( becoming a common trend for brit flicks ! ) takes over . truly a missed opportunity . * *  love and human remains directed by denys arcand is an abysmally pathetic film as it is completely different from the kind of films he has been making all through his career . making a different film is not an objectionable matter , what is troublesome is the fact that if a film from a master is complete out of tune then it is a really bad event . the film begins on a good note as there is some suspense created . however as the film progresses what is shown is just a futile attempt at creating something meaningful as arcand shows us half a dozen oddball , whimsical characters whose lives are intertwined with each other . homosexuality and lesbianism are not of any consequences here . what is even more bothersome is the feeling of guilt related to the characters who are rather in a fix regarding their feelings towards each other and sexuality . such a film would be of interest to some who wants to see a different denys arcand film . all in all , there would surely not be many takers for this film .  according to " lucien rebatet " in his " histoire de la musique " ( robert lafont , bouquins 1973 page 338 ) beethoven ' s character was not very compatible with women . he had quite a number of " platonic passions " with female members of the " vienese aristocracy " to whom he dedicated some " sonatas " . but musicians , even composers did not qualify for husbands of " fine ladies " . haydn was a " servant " of prinz von esterhazy , mozart died from drink or poison and bethoven was according to rebatet a frequent customer of " street prostitutes " in vienna . a british biographer , newman says that beethoven contracted syphilis , before he was 40 . that he became deaf because of that , is possible , but not certain . 

the ninth symphony was premiered on may 7 , 1824 in the kÃ¤rntnertortheater in vienna , along with the consecration of the house overture and the first three parts of the missa solemnis . this was the composer ' s first on-stage appearance in twelve years ; the hall was packed . although the performance was directed by michael umlauf the theater ' s kapellmeister , beethoven shared the stage with him quiet . 

so what remains of this " female fantasy " . ed harris interpretation and characterization are quite good , but too linear , based on the painting by ferninand waldmÃ¼ller date 1823 . i have it in front of me . it shows a man that despises ( perhaps hates ) the world . with good reason .  when i was a little girl , i absolutely adored the swan princess , it was reliving the same fairy tales of snow white , sleeping beauty , and cinderella , the princess and her prince who saves the day is always a timeless story that will never die , well , hopefully . but i figured that i would check out the sequels for the swan princess to see what they were like and unfortunately , this is the typical cartoon sequel that just disappoints more than entertains . the only character i found still very amusing was the queen , she was very funny in this movie and had the best part . but with the voice changes , they were noticeable and also bothered me quite a bit , i don ' t mean to be picky , just it was too weird for me . the story also was just more or less borrowed from the first swan princess , just the villain in this movie is following rothbart ' s footsteps . 

odette and derek are about to celebrate their one year anniversary , but derek has been too preoccupied with fighting for his kingdom to keep it safe . with his mother ' s birthday also coming up , he forgets about that since there is a new villain in town , clavious , who is hoping to go above and beyond where rothbart ' s powers went and kidnaps the queen on her birthday . but odette must change back into her swan self in order to help derek fight him and save his mother . 

the swan princess 2 is of course more than alright for the kids , that i never mind , it ' s good clean fun for them . the reason why these sequels are disappointing though is because it is usually just for the kids , that is the audience they aim for , but it ' s more enjoyable when the jokes and story can be enjoyed by everyone . now there are a few laughs and giggles here and there , but this wasn ' t as clever in my opinion to the first swan princess . i would recommend it for the little one ' s , but if you ' re looking for a fun cartoon movie , i ' d recommend staying with the first swan princess . 

4 / 10 solomon and sheba has come down in hollywood lore not for the quality of the film , but for the fact that tyrone power died while making it . i was in the 5th grade and well remember the huge news for days when that tragedy happened . i didn ' t know who tyrone power was then , but i learned and learned to appreciate the body of his work . 

i often wonder if ty had a sense about this film and what a dud it proved . he was the unnamed producer of this as well . maybe he just didn ' t want to face the critics . good thing power actually went out with witness for the prosecution although you can see him in long shots if you look close . 

what we have here is a biblical stew that probably would baffle the great solomon himself . several incidents described in the bible that the bible treats separately are woven together into one plot with a few additions tossed in by hollywood . 

the actual story about the queen of sheba is that she went on a trade mission to the kingdom of israel , chatted solomon up a bit , came back with a lot of trade goods and that was that . the story of a romance between her and solomon is of legend . the ancient kingdom of sheba is about where yemen is now and her people purportedly moved to the african continent which is how ethiopia was founded . 

the queen never witnessed solomon ' s famous case involving the two women with separate claims for a baby , nor was she involved with the building of the first temple . nor was she around for the destruction of same . for that matter neither was solomon . 

and she was not involved in the dispute over the succession when solomon ' s brother adonijah put in a counterclaim . that is the heart of this film . adonijah upon hearing the news that king david is dying declares himself king . of course david rallies temporarily and says that god came to him and said solomon should succeed him . when david hears about what adonijah did , he says that ' s what got god all bent out of shape , adonijah being greedy . after that adonijah gets to plotting . 

things seem to come full circle in that ty power collapsed on the set while dueling with george sanders as adonijah . sanders and power were rivals in many films , most particularly in lloyds of london which was power ' s breakthrough role . if sanders is not quite the jaded sophisticate he was in samson and delilah , he ' s still sanders the biblical cad . 

when power died yul brynner was brought in to play solomon and given a wig so that existing footage of power in long shot could be salvaged . brynner invests the dialog with the proper dignity , but i think he probably regretted doing the pinch hitting . 

gina lollobrigida is the queen of sheba and she is alluring as a biblical temptress in the cecil b . demille tradition . she seems not to have any real conviction and my guess is she was shocked at power ' s sudden demise and having to do it all over again . marisa pavan as abishag may give the best performance in the film . 

the real story with adonijah is not as elaborate as this film . he disputed with solomon for the succession and gathered around a group of some of king david ' s court as supporters . solomon pardoned them once and then adonijah asked for abishag in marriage . abishag in the bible and here was an adopted daughter of king david in his old age . when solomon hears that , he decides adonijah is getting greedy again and has him killed . the bible mentions someone named berniah who was going around basically doing contract hits on adonijah ' s supporters . 

what we have in the film is a spectacular climax involving a miracle that i searched for and couldn ' t find . it came from the fertile imagination of director king vidor who ended a long and distinguished career on a sour note . it was a question of vidor trying to out do cecil b . demille in biblical spectacle . 

he didn ' t make it .  this show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat idiot blue collar slob with the pretty ( and sometimes shrewish-seeming ) wife and crazy in-law ( s ) . with this show , it ' s fat unfunny comedian kevin james as doug hefferman who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service . he has a pretty wife , carrie ( leah remini ) , who works as legal assistant , and senile father-in-law , arthur spooner ( jerry stiller ) , who lives in his daughter and son-in-law ' s basement . kevin james ' doug is your typical beer drinking , sports loving , tv watching slob of a sitcom husband who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marital issues . he also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by this show ' s couple . beyond the few laughs supplied by jerry stiller ' s crazy old man character this show was generally unfunny . kevin james ' imbecilic behavior usually caused the show ' s problems that usually resolved by his wife . this show continued a run of sitcoms with the fat stupid father / husband and their pretty wives that all seemed to run on abc for some reason .  

this film was produced and released as a successor to a ghastly - although fairly popular - slapstick californian beach comedy called hardbodies , but it has little or no connection with the earlier film and is better assessed completely in its own right . it is certainly better than hardbodies i , and is more closely related to films such as venus and summer lovers which were also filmed during summer in the greek islands . the combination of blissful beaches on blue bays with beautiful bare bosoms makes for seductive viewing , but ( except for travelogues just designed to help plan your next holiday ) even such films require an adequate story line if they are to hold a viewers attention for more than a very few minutes . venus was underpinned by the legend of the re-incarnation of the goddess , and summer lovers had the viability of a " menage a trois " as its theme . in my view both these films were much more successful than hardbodies ii which has a very tenuous story line and depends too much on simplistic semi-slapstick comedy . the use of slapstick quickly becomes tedious , it usually leads to a series of very short self contained cameo sequences that are hard to integrate into an ongoing story line . mel brooks achieved this brilliantly with silent movie , but few other films have succeeded in the same way , and hardbodies ii unfortunately does not . there is also the problem that the slapstick sequences do not co-habit happily with the idyllic and peaceful scenario in which the film is set . the final airport sequences were no doubt intended to provide a hilarious ending for this film but in my opinion they are an example of the worst type of overplayed slapstick pseudo-comedy . they are also grossly overlong , so i left the cinema with a bad taste left in my mouth . this is a film which could have been much more successful with a stronger story line and with most of its slapstick sequences very heavily pruned . as it was released it certainly does not warrant a viewers rating higher than 3 . 

	there is little memorable in the acting , but the cast does its best within the limitations imposed by a meagre story line and poor direction - it is in these latter areas that the failure arises . 

 a real hoot , unintentionally . sidney portier ' s character is so sweet and lovable you want to smack him . nothing about this movie rings true . and it ' s boring to boot .  i was prepared to love " where ' s poppa " , it features the nexus of normal lear sitcom character actors who , when i was growing up , felt like extended members of my raisenette-sized broken nuclear family . how fun it would be to see censor-free barnard hughes , vincent gardenia , ron liebman , rob reiner , and a pre-snl garret morris . 

but alas , " where ' s poppa " drags . it ' s claustrophobic and plodding , and breaks the cardinal rules of farce , lightness of mood and a fast pace . 

the plot involves the efforts of a lawyer ( george segal ) to rid himself of his overbearing jewish mother , who lives in his gigantic new york apartment . along the way we are exposed ridiculous characters and situations : a comedic group of muggers who repeatedly mug the brother of the main character , the rape of a policeman which involving a gorilla suit and subsequent gay love , ruth gorden pulling down segal ' s pants and biting his ass as he serves her dinner . why doesn ' t this work ? part of the explanation is the sense of doom engendered by the cramped , dark interiors and antique set-decoration . i absolutely eat up cinematography of new york during this era , but watching this movie felt like i was leafing through the police gazette in a dark bus terminal . 

the main reason though is the slow pace . modern mtv-style quick cuts have changed what moviegoers feel is a comfortable editing tempo , but , even taking this into consideration , camera shots are held for an excessively long time . plot developments are also very slow . there is one situation in which this works : a weird love song george segal sings to trish van devere , softly , very close to her face , and for an excruciatingly long period of time . it reminded me of those cringeworthy extended shots in the british version of " the office " , where you find yourself mentally begging the camera to cut away , and at the same time you can ' t stop looking . 

sadly , most of the film is more " hurry up " than " can ' t look away " . which made me wonder if it ' s possible to have a black comedy that is also a farce . the dilemma is that the gravitas of the subject matter in a black comedy tends to weigh down lightness of the farce . movies like robert altman ' s " m * a * s * h " and kubrick ' s " dr . strangelove " prove that it can be accomplished . they do this not only through speed but also through entertaining subplots , something " where ' s poppa " neglects . 

although the film features multiple , stereotypically-funny characters , almost all of them are directly involved in the central drama of how to deal with the recalcitrant mother . the scenes featuring garret morris and the central park muggers are as close as the viewer gets to a mental break . the muggers seemed almost shakespearean , following the tradition of comic ne ' er-d0-wells . if the rest of " where ' s poppa " had clung a little more closely to stage tradition it would have been a better film . edgier isn ' t always better . it ' s as if all these talented actors and the director carl reiner , were taking a short before the creative maelstrom of the 70 ' s . 

random notes : after strealing ron liebman ' s clothes , the muggers mention cornel wilde ' s " the naked prey " ( 1966 ) , a great action movie that was a stylistic precursor to 1968 ' s " planet of the apes " . 

as politically incorrect as he was , it ' s disquieting to learn about the death of an action hero as formidable as charleton heston . linda harrison , who played " nova " , taylor ' s mute mate , said that james fransicus , in the sequel seemed to be cute and tiny compared to heston .  i saw a great clip of this film , which i ' ll talk about later , and then the cast list , and thought i might as well give it a go . basically , a down-on-his-luck bartender , randy ( matt dillon ) , his cocky cousin carl harding ( paul reiser ) and murder investigation detective dehling ( john goodman ) all have something in common , they have seen the girl of their dreams ( whether married or not ) , and they would do anything to please and be with her , even die . all three met / saw her " one night at mccool ' s " , the bar that randy worked at , they have no knowledge of each other , but all three cannot stop thinking of femme fetale jewel valentine ( the lord of the rings ' liv tyler ) . all three are telling their stories to someone they hope will listen to their pretty intense and revealing stories , randy talks to hit-man mr . burmeister ( michael douglas , who co-produced the film ) , carl to psychologist / psychiatrist dr . green ( reba mcentire ) and dehling to priest father jimmy ( richard jenkins ) . they confess all details of what they have been willing to do , their sexual contact with her , and eventually they are all brought together in one place , all intent on being with her , and all involved with the final shootout that leaves one dead , one running away ( and eventually dying ) and one stunned , and the unexpected guy she chooses ( but at the same time obvious , cos it ' s sex-obsessed douglas ) . also starring andrew dice clay as utah / elmo and sandy martin as bingo vendor woman . if i had to pick a favourite moment , it would definitely be what was mentioned at number 11 along with cool hand luke on the 100 greatest sexy moments , where tyler copycats the woman washing the car with suds all over herself , and in front of goodman , very sexy ! apart from that , not the most memorable film . okay !  i do not see what is the whole deal about this movie . patricia kaas sings , yes , and that makes the film charming , but singing is not enough . i mean , if you want to get all benefits of this one , go buy patricia ' s cd and enjoy ! the plot is simple ( if to omit the " dreams " ) ; the main characters seem to love each other instantly , and as well instantly forget their other acquaintances . relationships appear almost " mandatory " , and the little " detective story " thrown in just makes things worse . what at first appeared to be a perfect movie ending , is first screwed up and then comes out as just a dream . i measure movies by how well i would remember them , and for this one , i already started to forget the details .  having enjoyed neil gaiman ' s writing ( especially his collaboration with yoshitaka amano in " the dream hunters " ) in the past , i figured mirrormask to be a sure thing and was very disappointed . the beginning , live-action section of the movie was intriguing enough . the relationships between the characters was believable and easy to empathize with , and i loved the sets , the costuming , and helena ' s artwork . the subsequent computer-generated scenes , however , were excruciating . the dialogue was awkward and pretentious , the interaction between the live actors and the cgi horrifying . events occurred for the flimsiest reasons , and most events seemed superfluous to whatever plot may have existed . i only watched the first twenty or thirty minutes of the movie , so i ' m not exactly an authority , but i strongly recommend that you don ' t watch any of it at all and stick with gaiman ' s strong written work .  a very un-tom and jerry short . jerry narrates this tale that revolves around tom the cat falling in love and losing her to his rival , butch . tom is best friends with jerry here which irked me a bit . the cartoon is also presented in cinemascope . overall i found this tom and jerry cartoon sad and depressing . the should have just put " puss gets the boot " on the dvd instead and i would ' ve been happy . this experimental animated short can be found on disc 2 of warner brother ' s 2-dvd spotlight collection set . it ' s the last one on the set and i ' m hoping that warner brothers chooses to release a second volume soon . 

my grade : c- terrific production and a good comedic performance by george clooney can ' t save curiously detached , occasionally clumsy quasi-comedy from joel and ethan coen . depression-era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain-gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune , and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process ! the film meanders along but never builds any momentum . it does get a big boost from clooney ' s charismatic , gableesque mugging , and also from the art direction and t-bone burnett ' s lively music . otherwise , the screenplay ( by the coens ) is seriously lacking in humor and interest , supporting cameos by john goodman and holly hunter fail to add any lift , and the second-half of the movie slides precariously into self-indulgence . * * from * * * *  five years after the us civil war , western folk are more concerned with the age old war between homesteaders and cattle ranchers . the cattlemen herd their wares , from texas to the trail town of abilene , kansas . there , the cowboys find not only big money , but also big confrontation , with homesteaders . tall in the saddle marshal randolph scott ( as dan mitchell ) tries to keep peace in the town . mr . scott has experience mediating between trail hands and saloon patrons . he also juggles the town ' s finest looking women : sexy saloon singer ann dvorak ( as rita ) and pretty church lady rhonda fleming ( as sherry ) . boozy county sheriff edgar buchanan ( as bravo trimble ) offers more comic relief than sharp-shooting assistance . 

 " abilene town " begins with some promising symbolism and contrast : gunshots interrupt scott and ms . fleming singing a hymn in church ; then , the camera switches to ms . dvorak sexily singing her saloon number , which causes a man to fire his gun in pleasure . after that , it really becomes quite a standard western ; it is somehow duller than it should be , but not quite awful . young lloyd bridges appears as one of the homesteaders . dvorak ' s leggy costume is the film ' s greatest asset ; in it , she is a real mover . 

 * * * * abilene town ( 1 / 11 / 46 ) edwin l . marin ~ randolph scott , ann dvorak , edgar buchanan in order to enjoy ' fur - an imaginary portrait of diane arbus , ' stephen shainberg needs the viewer to suspend all reality and prior knowledge of the american photographer , diane arbus . paradoxically , it ' s the very use of diane arbus ' name and knowledge to her life and work , that sets this film up to fail on a grand scale . 

what becomes apparent quite early on with the casting of the beautiful waspish and glamorous nicole kidman as the anti-glamorous jewish diane arbus , is that shainberg didn ' t get arbus or what her work was about ( unsentimental realism ) and seems only attracted to arbus on a superficial level through her photographs of circus freaks . 

what follows is a kind of pretty and trivial beauty & the beast fantasy biopic with robert downey jr as kidman ' s hairy fictional love interest . however , it ' s not the banality of the story that is the main flaw in this film , but the director ' s misogynistic stance that diane arbus , one of the art world ' s most singular and original woman photographers , was incapable of forming her own ideas about her work . while his previous film ' secretary ' was a study of female masochism , his continued portrayal of the female as submissive spoils this film completely - and flys in the face of the real life diane arbus ' courage , tenacity and fearlessness in single-handedly exploring the often shady world of outsiders . 

imagine an imaginary biopic on pop star madonna ' s life with guy richie as her svengali , the man behind her career , and you ' ll get a feel of how seriously flawed and imaginary this film is : it can only work if you have absolutely no knowledge of the subject , or just choose to ignore all the facts . 

it ' s a shame because once you remove all reference to diane arbus , this film could have stood up on its own as an interesting study on fetishism and a good companion piece to secretary . 4 / 10 director delbert mann was a much better director than this film indicates . he directed all quiet on the western front , that touch of mink , and the last days of patton among others . this mediocre , made for television retelling of dicken ' s masterpiece is so bad , even those unfamiliar with the often filmed tale , will be unsatisfied . 

besides the fact that the movie is available from only two known suppliers ( brentwood and bci eclipse llc ) the poor quality of the transfer , and the scratchy and muddied sound track make the task of finding this film on video not worth the effort . 

i have always believed that if a company is going to put a film on video and charge the public money to buy it , then they should at least have a descent copy of the film and do a good job on the transfer . unfortunately neither of the two suppliers have such a work ethic and the result is only fit for the bargain bin in the local discount store . 

the story is told mainly through flashbacks , making the film episodic and talky . much of the rich detail of the novel is lost in this translation . the characters of martha , traddles and others have been cut and the relationship of young david and steerforth is not explored enough , so we are left wondering why david would hang out with the guy . 

the relationship between david the boy , and young agnes is never developed and it is hard to understand why she and david eventually marry . since martha is left out , it is a mystery how dan peggoty finds his niece . and the absence of traddles makes david a very lonely fellow . 

some have credited this film with doing a good job of abridging the lengthy novel . i disagree , this is at best a hatchet job on the book . anyone who has seen the 1935 george cukor version will agree . 

the performances in that version by fields as micawber and rathbone as murdstone , are definitely worth the trouble of watching it . and the more recent masterpiece theatre version ( april 2000 ) and hallmark ( 2000 ) versions are both outstanding achievements in made for television adaptations of classic novels . directors simon curtis and peter medak who are responsible for those films are deserving of the highest praise . 

my final comment on david copperfield 1969 is don ' t buy it , there are several much better versions of the film available . if it is on television , turn the channel to something else . it is a waste of one hour and twenty minutes of your life . sorry folks , but i can ' t praise such an appallingly bad film .  secret service agent jay killion ( charles bronson ) has been assigned to protect the president-elect ' s wife , the new first lady ( jill ireland ) . she is a very difficult woman and killion has his hands full . she is the victim of numerous assassination attempts , all directed by the president ' s chief of staff , who wants the first lady dead . this movie insults your intelligence with not only the story line , but also with the lack of realistic locations . for example , in the scene depicting the inaugural parade , the first lady is in a rolls royce convertible with agent killion and without the president . also , we know what washington , dc , is like weather wise in january , and not only is everybody " top coat less " , you can even see some palm trees in the 70 degree and sunny weather ! ( obviously filmed in hollywood , not washington , dc ) . this movie is a joke . it is not worth your time .  in the twilight years of his career , charles bronson forged long-running partnerships with several directors , most notably j . lee thompson and michael winner . he did two films for one-time bond director peter hunt too - the first being the decent 1981 actioner death hunt , the second being this indifferent political chase thriller . assassination is pretty dull if truth be known , and come the end you ' ll find yourself longing for something with a bit more passion and pace , like the wilby conspiracy for instance ( which , plotwise , this film resembles ) . 

 bronson sleepwalks through his role as bodyguard jay killian , whose assignment is to protect the american president ' s wife , lara royce craig ( jill ireland , real-life wife of bronson ) . killian believes that mrs craig has been targetted by assassins ; she thinks he ' s an over-protective , paranoid pessimist . turns out - surprise , surprise - that killian was right all along and someone is indeed out to eradicate her . the pair of them go on the run , pursued by the assassins . 

 everyone knows that the wife of an american president is known as the first lady . for some reason , in this film they have renamed her " one mama " ! quite what the point of this is is anybody ' s guess , but it ' s indicative of the film ' s pointlessness as a whole . most of the film ' s performances are lazy , and the script takes a heck of a long time to get to where it ' s going . if i had to label assassination within a specific genre , i ' d say it is supposed to be a " thriller " . i ' d say that with some reservations , however , as to say that it ' s a thriller it has precious few thrills .   " the brotherhood of satan " is a stupefying combination of conventional horror elements mixed with some imaginative characterization and direction ( bernard mceveety ) . it all starts out with father charles bateman ( as ben ) driving out west with his pretty blondes : luscious ahna capri ( as nicky ) , and daughter geri reischl ( as k . t . ) . things get weirder and weirder for the trio , as they approach the town of hillsboro , which is being gripped by a satanic cult ! 

when the dullish travelers hit hillsboro , the " action " switches to the film ' s more interesting assemblage of characters : townies l . q . jones ( as pete , the sheriff ) , strother martin ( as doc ) , charles robinson ( as jack , the priest ) , and alvy moore ( as tobey ) . their interplay is sometimes fun . soon enough , it all gets very silly , and predictable . mr . martin is the stand-out ( as you might expect ) ; he considers the possibility of a satanic cult to be a " cock-and-bull story " , but is ( of course ) their leader . the " come in , children " ending is puzzling ; unless , perhaps , it was the film ' s original title .  there is not much to say about this one except that it is probably the worst of the early spate of zombie movies ( i may get to watch another one , revolt of the zombies [1936] , before the month is out ) . for all star john carradine ' s intention of building an army in the service of the third reich with them , they are not seen to do much at all ! ; james baskett ( uncle remus from song of the south [1946] ! ) plays their leader , who also serves as carradine ' s manservant . black comic mantan moreland reprises his ' fraidy cat ' chauffeur role from king of the zombies ( 1941 ) , as does the exotically named madame sul-te-wan as carradine ' s housekeeper . unfortunately for carradine , his supreme achievement Â the zombification of his wife Â brings him all sorts of trouble : not only do her relatives turn up at his remote abode / lab to inquire into her sudden death ( which means he has to fake a funeral service ! ) but she actually proves disobedient and indignant , eventually ' persuading ' her fellow zombies to rise against their master ! ! also involved is cowboy star bob steele ( still best-known for his bit in howard hawks ' the big sleep [1946] ) who plays a u . s . secret agent posing as a nazi posing as a sheriff ! thankfully , director sekely would have much better luck with his next genre effort , the day of the triffids ( 1962 ) .   " a lot of the films i ' ve made probably could have worked just as well 50 years ago , and that ' s just because i have a lot of old-fashion values . " - steven spielberg

some points . . 

1 . though this film is a loose remake of " a guy named joe " , it also borrows heavily from " a matter of life and death " and " wings of desire " . 

2 . this was spielberg ' s second attempt at being frank capra . 

3 . spielberg has often said that he wishes to make a " frank capra movie " in the vein of " it ' s a wonderful life " and " mrs smith goes to washington " . judging from his recent attempts to get a " harvey " remake off the ground , it seems as though spielberg still holds this dream , the director rightfully not satisfied with his last 3 ventures into capracorn . 

4 . critics at the time bashed " always " , stating that the elaborate action sequences distracted from the film ' s romance , but that ' s really not the problem at all . the problem is that " always " needs a lot more special effects to distract us from the fact that spielberg can ' t film any line of dialogue that doesn ' t end in an exclamation point . 

5 . the film is filled with comedy that just doesn ' t work . spielberg ' s comedic tastes aren ' t very sophisticated , and seem to be ripped right out of 1950 ' s screwballs and looney tune cartoons . these exaggerated antics may work in a cartoon universe , but in a film it just seems like an odd marriage . 

6 . the film ' s lead couple come across as brother and sister , not lovers . spielberg ' s films have always being apprehensive toward sex and intimacy , but this film goes to extreme lengths : she ' s a wisecracking tomboy and he ' s a wisecracking old man . they ' re more irritating than endearing . 

7 . the film contains one good scene , in which john goodman argues with holly hunter , but for the most part the film ' s characters are too annoying . there ' s no subtlety , every emotion overplayed , every joke over designed , every sequence filled with unnecessary busyness . 

8 . " always " and " hook " taught spielberg how to con audiences . after their failure ( and the twin financial failures of " the color purple " and " empire of the sun " ) spielberg dumped the goofy colour cinematography of " color purple " and " empire of the sun " in favour for the more desaturated " black and white " worlds of " schindler ' s list " , " munich " , " minority report " and " saving private ryan " . from here on , " less light " and " dark cinematography " became equated with " serious topics " . 

9 . after the financial success of each " dark film " spielberg reverts back to his colour cinematography , and falls flat on his face once again . " amistad " followed " schindler ' s list " , " ai " followed " ryan " and " lincoln " will follow " munich " . these " colour " films are always bashed for being too tacky , sentimental , corny and hokey , but the truth is , if you removed the desaturation , all these " serious " films would feel the same way . 

10 . since the 70s , spielberg has tried to differentiate himself from the other brat pack directors ( scorsese , de palma , coppola etc ) , by pretending to be an " optimist " and " humanist " . he would himself state this repeatedly during many interviews in the late 70s . the reality , though , is that he is probably the biggest sadist of all these directors , the very form of his films often undermining their content , their very box office performances always proportionate to their dazzling displays of carnage . 

11 . the failure of spielberg to connect with any of the characters in " always " , and the relish he shows , instead , for filming forest fires , air-planes crashing etc , perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography . people running from dinosaurs , sharks , nazis , tripods , rocks etc . . . this is what spielberg delights in . the moment his characters stop to speak , however , everything self-destructs . a film like " amistad " failed , in other words , because not enough blacks died and too many whites talked . 

12 . the film ' s flying scenes aren ' t up to the standard ' s set several years earlier in the mega-hit " top gun " . of course , when your " enemy " is a forest fire , it ' s hard to make things cinematic . 

13 . failures like " 1941 " , " hook " , " always " etc are often more illuminating that spielberg ' s more successful films . they reveal the steel skeleton beneath the technique . they show what the amusement park ride looks like when its not working , revealing the vacuum beneath the broken machinery . 

5 / 10 Â there ' s one good sequence here ( two actors in a room , simply improvising ) , but this is mostly an annoying picture with a predictable script . 

worth one viewing .  director kinji fukasaku is perhaps best known , in his homeland at least , for his japanese gangster films , a series with which this movie shares a number of characteristics . violence and political intrigue are themes throughout both shogun ' s samurai and battles without honor and humanity , and both feature a lead character who finds his loyalties challenged by betrayals . both films also feature a large number of characters who seem to have little purpose but to die , and since so little is done to develop them , their deaths have little impact when they do come . this film has other flaws as well . the makeup , costumes and sound design are distractingly poor , and the battle scenes were substandard as well , inferior to other samurai films of earlier years ( seven samurai comes to mind ) . 

sonny chiba plays the sonny chiba character in shogun ' s samurai , the no-nonsense master swordsman who strides through the film , scowling menacingly . what a guy ; he even gets to wear an eye patch . if you were expecting to see the legendary toshiro mifune , you may be disappointed ; his appearance amounts to little more than a cameo , and just when it appears that his character might do something interesting , he disappears for good . 

overall , the strengths of the film are its story , which is infinitely more comprehensible than those gangster films , and the challenges posed to traditional concepts of good and evil . two brothers are challenging for the throne of their recently departed father , who may have had some help on his way out . early on , it looks as if we will be faced with a couple of characters who couldn ' t be more clearly good and evil ; after all , the older brother stammers and has a birthmark , the sure sign of a villain . eventually , however , it becomes clear that in a winner-takes-all struggle for power , there are no heroes and villains , only winners and losers .  the recent release of " mad dog morgan " on troma dvd is disappointing . this appears to be a censored print for television viewing . some of the more violent scenes have been edited and portions of the colorful language have been removed . anyone who viewed the film uncut will be mad as hell at this toxic dvd version . " mad dog morgan " deserves to be released on dvd in the original theatrical cut . however , even as released on dvd , the film is still one of the better depictions of bushranger life in nineteenth century australia . after having toured the old melbourne gaol , with death masks of convicts on display , it is " mad dog morgan " that comes to mind .  glenn ford , a new york boy who has been saving his cash , thumbs and hobos his way to the arizona ranch he has bought , where he hopes to find heaven with a barbed wire fence . 

a film with a dalton trumbo script and story , directed by villain extraordinaire ricardo cortez , and starring the frequently twitchy glenn ford and the restless richard conte just shouldn ' t be so bloody nice . though the system -- mostly seen as mean cops and railroad bulls and real estate con men -- is as awful as one might expect from the leftish mr . trumbo , every single proletarian is just so sweet and nice and salt of the earth that one feels nausea . it doesn ' t help that the heroine -- a sweet blonde thing who is an illegal alien refugee fleeing franco ' s spain -- is annoying for reasons of both scripting and acting . 

so why watch ? richard conte , in his first role , already has his persona and a pretty good part . and there are some moments of 30s leftist camp that are pretty astonishing . ( did dalton absolutely have to set a major portion of the movie in the russian worker ' s mission ? all that was missing was a portrait of a beaming joe stalin ! ) also , this is glenn ford ' s first substantive role ( though his performance isn ' t good ) . 

why not watch ? essentially , the movie offers an unconvincing vision , is wedded to a political viewpoint that is risible , and the two leads have made much better movies . also , the strengths of dalton trumbo as a screenwriter are nowhere in evidence . instead , we get a film that the coen brothers barton fink could have written in a flash ( and avoided that hellish bout with writer ' s block ) .  this sickly sweet and laboriously paced 5-reeler is definitely not among harold lloyd ' s better films . gags are sparse and mostly uninspired . saccharine melodrama is abundant . the setup takes forever , as lloyd , the unconventional , but impossibly kindly , country doctor makes his rounds , bringing a little sunshine into the lives of children , the elderly , and puppies . it ' s like a 1922 version of patch adams . ugh . 4 / 10 .  julie delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in france of the 14th century . the film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalry image of the heroic medieval knight , by showing a rather dreary image of the period , defined by psychological dysfunction , and violence . 

the movie opens with a child , franÃ§ois , growing up in the shadow of the hundred years ' war , told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return . franÃ§ois takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed . franÃ§ois murders him in the name of defending his father ' s honour . like father like son , franÃ§ois grows up , and leaves his family , also to go to the same war . this setting is somewhat of an explanation for the events to come , as on his way home , we already notice that something is wrong with franÃ§ois . the war has not done well with him , he has changed . 

the daughter , bÃ©atrice de cortemart ( delpy ) , awaits her beloved father , to return from captivity of the english . she is pure of heart and she was left to take care of the estate while her father was gone . in her father ' s absence , bÃ©atrice needs to deal with financial difficulties , which strengthens bÃ©atrice ' s hope that her father will return to save her . but , upon his return , she notices that he lost the will to enjoy life , and he tortures and humiliates everything around him , even his own daughter . from this points the film depicts various ways how franÃ§ois torments his family . starting with humiliating his own son , and ending with the rape of his own daughter , bÃ©atrice . 

setting the film in the middle ages supposed to soften the blow , as the viewer may tell himself , that these kind of violent acts were held in difficult times . and indeed , many films on the topic of incest , such as tim roth ' s " the war zone ( 1999 ) " which are contemporary were more shocking because of that . 

delpy appears in this film in several daring nude scenes . indeed she appears to be angelic and beautiful . 

i was annoyed when i saw some animal torture scenes . i believe , and this is not confirmed , that some birds were killed for the making of this film , which really upsets me . the quality of a film drops when real violence is used towards animals . i would hope that this movie will be re-released without those cruelty scenes . those scenes do not contribute much to the film storyline . 

overall , the movie is too long . the script is problematic . we don ' t get to see franÃ§ois and bÃ©atrice before the war , we don ' t really get the answer why is he changed to such extreme . i would have pass on this film , however , i have to mention a few scenes that made this film worth watching : 

 * scenes of a young child being able to murder in cold blood is truly shocking . i saw it first time on " city of god ( 2002 ) " . here , franÃ§ois , murders his mother ' s lover , while his father away at war . excellent scene and very graphic . * the scenes from bÃ©atrice being raped by her father till she finds out she is pregnant from him are truly shocking and interesting . the scene after the rape , where delpy burns her cloths and cleans herself . she asks her brother to kick her in the stomach with hopes to have a miscarriage . 

 * the brother humiliation scenes where the father dumps his son ' s head into the food - humiliating him then ranting about the war . later , dressing his son with women ' s cloths . 

the film won the cÃ©sar ( french oscar ) for best costume design , i agree , the costumes here really make the film look authentic for the time period . the movie location is chÃ¢teau de puivert , a real 12th century castle and a historical monument , located in aude , south-central france . beautiful castle and mountain view , really helps you set into the period of this film . the film also nominated for 3 more cÃ©sar awards , but they were all snatched to the widely successful french film " au revoir , les enfants " ( " goodbye , children " , 1998 ) . 

--- released as " beatrice " in new york city , march 1987 . only to be screened in france on november 2007 . watched it on yes3 on 3 may 2007 , 17 : 45 , at work .  in this follow up to the naked civil servant we see the final years of quentin crisp ' s life in new york . john hurt is again crisp ( come on who else could play the part ? ) and its a role he inhabits to the point of disappearing . for me hurt is crisp and i ' ve always found it very hard to take the man himself because hurt was more him than he was himself . its masterful performance . his equal is denis o ' hare as phillip steele , crisp ' s long time friend and confidant . 

unfortunately outside of the performances the film has little to recommend it . to be certain the film gets the details right . filmed in and around new york the film the film looks and feels like new york and its environs , but dramatically its kind of inert . its crisp talking to people being witty , trying to come to terms with the world as it is ( he ended up regretting some poorly chosen words concerning aids ) and dealing with the infirmities that old aged thrust upon him . quentin the man is always interesting , but his life as portrayed is really not . 

i am disappointed by the film . i ' ve always admired the man and his unique point of view . i just wish he was better served by this film about his life .  i have only seen this movie once , when i was about 14 years old , but i was thrilled that they made a movie about the 45th division . being from oklahoma and especially now that both of my sons are members of the 45th , i would like to see it released on a dvd . i may sound a little bias but the 45th division sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves today . the history channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when it talks about ww2 and korea but you rarely hear it mention the 45th . one of the scene that really stood out for me was when the had the indian code talkers at work and the puzzled look on the german soldiers faces when they could not understand this language . i am glad that all of the native american code talkers are getting the recognition they deserve .  rigoletto is verdi ' s masterpiece , full of drama , emotion and powerful , memorable music . the maestro must have rolled in his grave when this bawdy travesty of his work was released with its needless frontal nudity and cheap copulating and its portrayal of the naive but principalled gilda as a horny ditz . opera certainly can be adapted to cinema --- look at zeferelli ' s magnificent la traviata --- but when a work is as superb as rigoletto , it doesn ' t need cheap gimmicks . it might even have been acceptable if the dubbed in music had been good but it is a mediocre rendering of the libretto with second rate sound quality at that .  overrated mob comedy . director demme makes the actors pause after some funny lines to let audience laugh , and not miss next line . seems odd - this director did " silence of the lambs " - now there ' s the way to use pauses ! casting seems off . mathew modine too young for fbi agent and pfeiffer ' s love interest ! dean stockwell is doing a jack nicholson-thing with a squint , and he gets a nomination for it ! plus we have to accept pfeiffer and stockwell as italians ? charles napier as a hairdresser and al lewis as a mob lawyer are underused with only one line each - they should be the bumbling hoods . song score by chris isaak is totally out of place - better for a flick like " pretty in pink . " re-make this movie , it ' s worth it , but with proper casting and director and the satire will come through . . . even the often repeated " forgedaboutit . "  a sadly predictable , clichÃ©d story about a woman who was no better than she should have been . sadly , too , the screenplay is by the once-great experimental novelist john dos passos , from an original by french exotic potboiler pierre louys . this time marlene dietrich is concha , a manipulative , cold-hearted spanish beauty . don pasqual ( lionel atwill ) raises her from the cigarette factory , but she ditches him . he warns his tall young friend antonio ( cesar romero ) against her , but to no avail . a duel ensues , concha reproaches pasqualito for trying to kill the only man she ever cared for , so he doesn ' t : he points his pistol at the sky , but antonio shoots him . but instead of going off to paris with the young victor , she goes back to the man who would have died for her . with an unexpected bit by edward everett horton as a spanish governor . dietrich plays the part of a spanish woman by moving constantly , twisting at the waist and posturing and then twisting back , flouncing , tossing her head , and so forth . and she makes faces , and has a curl in the middle of her forehead . the photography is strangely crowded : no outdoor scene can be shot except through a tangle of bare trees , no interior scene can be shot without so much busy detail that it ' s almost impossible to follow people moving across a room , no consecutive scene of dietrich can be shot without a major wardrobe change . the carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers it ' s almost like an underwater scene in the sargasso sea .  poor jane austen ought to be glad she ' s not around to see this dreadful wreck of an adaptation . so many great jane austen movies have come out recently that this one deserves to be permanently buried along with two other movies i despise-the man in the gray flannel suit and the 1969 version of david copperfield . my main beef with the movie is that it completely misses the point of the book . jane austen was poking fun at the gothic mania in her society , and much of the novel is tongue in cheek . the movie , however , is serious and comes across terribly melodramatically . the lighthearted , fun-poking flavor of austen ' s writing is completely and conspicuously absent from this ponderous foray iinto horror meets period drama . the scenes of catherine ' s imagination are both gratuitous and uninteresting . also , henry tilney is dreadfully unappealing . why , i ask , would anyone fall for him ? if you are looking for a fun-filled jane austen evening , watch emma instead !  of all of the post-1985 perry mason movies i have seen , this one is my least favorite . 

i confess i have never liked diana muldaur as an actress . she only seems to know how to play one type of character - a hard-bitten career woman with some undefined chip on her shoulder who for that reason is extremely difficult to in any way sympathize with . this one is no exception - it runs true to form . 

the only thing that saves this movie , in my opinion , is an earnest performance by scott baio as the prosecutor - i actually found myself rooting for him to win , and the movie is worth seeing for him alone .  the women ( 2008 ) by diane english is sadly such a waste of talent . with annette benning , candice bergen , bette midler , cloris leachman whom i like and enjoy in everything i ' ve seen them , and meg ryan , jada pinkett smith , debra messing , and eva mendes who may not be my favorite actors but are nice to look at , how could the movie be boring , predictable , embarrassing , sloppy , and simply bad ? it was made by diane english who is known as the writer of the very successful tv show murphy brown , and it is her first movie for which she wrote a script . the movie has been a labor of love for english who had tried for many years to make it happen and i respect that . i even found the scenes with the supporting players , bergen , leechaman , carry fisher and bette middler in short but memorable cameos , funny , smart , and enjoyable but in general the movie is a second hand " sex and the city " which was released few months ago . i did not find sex and the city very good when i saw it but next to the women , it was simply brilliant . at least , sex and the city spared us the long and tasteless scene in the hospital ' s delivery room where one of the characters ' was having a baby and her friends were there supporting her . poor debra messing , what did she do to deserve that nightmare she was put through and we , the viewers together with her ? the movies like " the women " give the whole genre , chick flicks , a bad name . it is nothing wrong with the genre , but why is it so difficult to make a really good comedy about female friendships and hardships , about dealing with marriage , motherhood , and proving yourself professionally ? these are all very compelling and important subjects any modern woman can relate to . why making movies with the lines , dialogs , and situations so clichÃ©d , predictable , not funny and insulting that they will be forgotten as soon as the movie is over ? 

after i saw the new movie , i checked out from my local library the original the women and i truly enjoyed it . the story was told much better 70 years ago , and kept my interest all the way . the old movie had a real star power .  this is a family movie set in 1950 ' s rural america about a boy whose uncle presses sheep killing charges against his dog drum , starting not only a family legal feud but community discord as their town begins to take sides . 

this is formula film that attempts to be very touching and sweet . its biggest weakness is that the only people who could really act were scott bakula ( defense lawyer ) , ron perlman ( father / drum ' s owner ) and the dog . ( john shuck and kathy garver , " sissy " from the original " family affair , " as the uncle and his wife , were okay . ) the children were not that good ( basically they looked like they were acting ) and that ' s a problem when the film really revolves around them ( aaron fors , who plays the bully donny makes me think of what the actor russell crowe must have looked liked as a child , only with no talent but a lot of ham ) . 

favorite line ( spoken by the prosecutor after scott bakula ' s defense closing trial speech ) : " we ' ll be lucky if they don ' t lynch us . " 

favorite line spoken by ron perlman ( after his son punches the bully ) : " now making him your friend , that will be the hard part . " 

cute enough to rent / buy used .  always enjoy the classic horror films , however , this film was really a big waste of time and if it were not for john carradine playing the mad man doctor who is able to control human beings through his experiments . this film was made during ww ii and john carradine was a german nazi working to find a human weapon against the entire world . bob steele playing in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture bob seemed bored to death with his role in this film and acted like this was his first film . mantan moreland , ( jeff ) gave an outstanding performance with great comedy which helped keep the audience attention . i hate to criticize a film made in 1943 , but this is really a big disappointment . if you like john carradine and the roles he played as count dracula throughout many films during the 1940 ' s , you just might like to watch john doing his best .  the theatrics and the drama included in the movie is fantastic , but the facts and the research is far from solid . when quoting dr . bovon , where the documentary tries to establish a connection to mary magdalene from mariamene , dr . bovon later clarifies it should be used for literary purposes ( ie : fables of that time ) not for a historical figure . in fact he states , he does not believe the mariamene ossuary in talpiot is mary magdalene . he further comments on his public letter , that he was not informed that his words would be used for this documentary but rather for information regarding acts of philip ( a literary work in the 4th century ) . 

so what we have here is a director that took one clip for a 4th century acts of philip fantasy and used it specifically to support a 1st century ossuary inscription . a very sad stretch and dr . bovon calls the jesus / mary magdalene connection as " science fiction " -- as this documentary should be rightly labeled .  after having watched darwin ' s nightmare , one must have the impression of tanzania being a living hell , with its population being quasi-slaves delivering the finest fish to the well-fed europeans while leaving the fish bones to the starving population . in exchange for the fish they get western-made weapons , which the mainly unemployed population eagerly awaits to use , because being a soldier is their only source of income . 

so everything is all dark with trade as the incarnation of evil and source of all misery ? not quite . fortunately darwin ' s nightmare shows the dark sides only and completely spares the positive aspects . in fact , the documentary hardly tells anything about the economic and ecologic importance the victoriaperch has for the region . 

for the countries around lake victoria the victoriaperch is the second to third most important source of income . the wages in the fishing industry are way above average . tanzania has banned huge trawlers to secure the jobs of thousands of fishermen . the adjacent states have met agreements to keep fishing on a sustainable level . cities at the lake are benefiting from the taxes the fishers have to pay for each kilogram caught fish and the taxes on the factories ' exports and profits . furthermore tanzania has banned exporting the local traditional fish , which still play an important role feeding the local population . 

by ignoring those positive signs the documentary deters the badly needed western consumers and investors and thus threatens to aggravate the african ' s situation . 

for further reading i can recommend two articles the german alternative-wing newspaper wrote on the subject : http : / / www . taz . de / pt / 2006 / 09 / 02 / a0013 . 1 / textdruck http : / / www . taz . de / pt / 2005 / 03 / 17 / a0151 . 1 / text i bought this movie at a thrift store . months before , my friend told me about it when we were talking about dumb movies we ' ve seen . once i spotted the cassette , i knew i had to have it . i watched it that night . i could tell it was going to be very cheesy and cheaply done . . . that ' s what drew me to it . i popped it in and i laughed the whole way through . i recognized gregory ( the ice cream man ) , but i didn ' t recognize his name and i couldn ' t remember where i saw him . later , while watching the andy griffith show , clint howard ( ice cream man ) was featured as an extra since he is ron howard ( opie taylor ) ' s brother . i saw the credits and i gasped . i turned to my mom , who was also watching the show , and said , " that ' s the ice cream man ! ! " she , too , gasped . this movie is great , but only for laughs and criticalness . it is the perfect example of a cheesy horror flick . if you feel like laughing as well as poking fun at low-budget movies , rent this video .   . . . at least during its first half . if it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes , it would have been a much better and tighter film . the second half of the film is worth it , especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships , but it ' s like a dull toothache getting there . also , don ' t watch this film just because ginger rogers is in it . she has an important role , but it ' s a small one . 

the film starts out showing three new york city buddies working the tourist trade and also in good-natured competition for the hand of sally ( ginger rogers ) , a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue . world war i breaks out , the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle , yet enlist in the navy anyways . the one of the three with the least industry as a civilian ( bill boyd as baltimore ) winds up the commanding officer to the other two ( robert armstrong as dutch and james gleason as skeets ) . to make matters more complex , sally has fallen in love with one of the three , but doesn ' t have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to war . 

the film is a little more interesting on board ship , mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself , and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable . however , james gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby , especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible . 

one real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design , or , i should say , the lack of it . in the scenes in new york just prior to wwi we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 - no effort was taken to bring this film into period . 

in conclusion , if you watch the few scenes with ginger rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission , you ' ve seen everything here worth seeing . the rest is padding .  when i was young , i ' d get up early every saturday morning not to watch cartoons but to turn on the local channel for what was called ' kung fu theatre . ' it wasn ' t as if these films were works of art . it wasn ' t as if these films all came from china , japan , korea , or any country in particular ; if the story had to do with fighting Â be it swordplay or fisticuffs Â and if the fighting didn ' t resemble much of anything going on in any american gym class , then that was good enough . it wasn ' t as if they were really even very good . they were just great action flicks with incredibly over-dramatic music where the hero reaped his vengeance over a whole host of bad guys , and then the credits would roll . 

 " sword in the moon " is much like these films of my youth , arguably a bit of a thematic throwback given a welcome twist by muddying the characters up enough that it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the bad guys from the good . 

yun ( cho jae hyun ) is known throughout the kingdom as ' the human butcher . ' he kills quickly and mercilessly on behalf of the chun dynasty , the chief bodyguard of an emperor who spared his life and the life of his men in exchange for his service . however , an equally merciless rebel and his lovely sidekick appear in the countryside and start murdering imperial ministers , and yun agrees to find these rebels and kill them . his task becomes one of personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are choi ( a friend from his past ) and his former love , shi yeong . 

sadly , " sword " doesn ' t have much to distinguish itself from other action films . some stunning cinematography is nearly entirely wasted on shoddy editing with portions of the film put together so loosely its hard to believe that what inevitably made it to the film was what anyone intended . while the atmosphere and story tend to gravitate toward a dark mood , the tone is almost sacrificed to the never-ending parade of flashbacks as each of the main characters is given a healthy story arc . what should ' ve been a quick and easy action film gets weighed down by far too much personal baggage , and the film suffers as a result . 

i ' ve read that this film marks korea ' s first real foray into the world of art-house action pieces along the likes of " crouching tiger , hidden dragon . " next time , i ' d strongly suggest that the producers stick with a little more ' martial ' and a little less ' art . '  am i the only person who thinks that the entire forensics and scenes of crime community in the usa must detest this almighty slap in their faces . a rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera . by the time he returns ( still no senior cops , socos or other assistance for the lovely jolie - this is new york isn ' t it ? ? ) it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence , only after she ' d stood in front of an amtrak to stop it disturbing the scene . 

i want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the images ! ! the horror continues : - not in the film itself ( pretty ordinary i ' m afraid ) but in the lincoln rhyme character as played by mr washington . this man is a highly dedicated forensic crime scene examiner with years of experience who , instead of the highly trained but invisible local crime scene examiners , entrusts the work to an untrained cop , a rookie cop , who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clues and move them before photographing them thus contaminating every item and making dna profiling well nigh impossible . now that was a bright idea eh ? i know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely disengaged their ability to think in order to find this film believable . 

i have given this film 4 / 10 for the superb acting of denzel washington and for miss jolie ' s lips which are the only items requiring my disbelief to be suspended !  this is the slowest " film noir " film i ' ve ever seen . very weak script only provides opportunity for jack palance and rod steiger to deliver exceptionally well , lines that were made for an acting audition . palance and steiger both affirm they are indeed serious actors who can portray their respective roles with power , emotion and drama . the story itself moves at an incredibly slow pace , mostly taking place in a living room . the director obviously moved the actors around in a rythmatic circles as they delivered exhaustingly long lines , to keep the slow pace from becoming noticeable to the audience . the action doesn ' t pick up until the last ten minutes of the film . if you ' re one who ' s looking for more depth in a crime drama , this one ' s not for you !  gordon goes over the top in typical full moon fashion , but that ' s to be expected . combs is surprisingly low-key , keeping his performance at a more realistic level than we are used to seeing . also gone is the usual stuart gordon ' tongue-in-cheek ' black humor . 

the film is quite effective in showing combs ' break down and his final heroic act to save his wife & daughter . you actually feel sympathy for his character , despite his short-comings . 

personally , i was more surprised at the nudity and borderline porno sex scene , than i was shocked by the graphic violence & gore . 

not classic gordon , but certainly something you might enjoy if you ' ve seen his more famous films .  dear readers , 

i ' ve found in my studies of movies that whenever michael bay makes a movie , people pan it and hate it , yet they still go to see it and it makes somewhere around 100 million dollars . why ? because michael bay is one of the top five directors of all time . standing alongside ridley scott , spielberg , kubrick , and miyazaki , michael bay has cemented himself as hollywood ' s best action / adventure director . that point is proved with his most panned film , armageddon . 

an asteroid the size of texas is hurtling towards the planet and the only way nasa can think to take it down is to land a team of men on the asteroid , drill to its core , and drop a nuclear warhead inside then blow up the asteroid . only one person is qualified enough to do it : bruce willis . willis portrays harry stamper , a grizzled hardened oil driller trying to keep what ' s left of his family together . not helping that fact is his daughter , grace ( liv tyler ) , having an affair with his best driller , aj ( ben affleck ) . hired by dan truman ( billy bob thornton ) , the head of nasa , stamper and his team of roughneck drillers train to become astronauts and save the world . 

armageddon is a two part movie . first there ' s the funny parts where we meet the gang and wackiness abounds . then they get into space and all the comedy gets sucked out the window and is replaced by mind-blowing special effects , cool music , and great serious acting . murphy ' s law goes insane in the second part , meaning that everything that can go wrong , does in fact go wrong , increasing the tension of the film to outstanding levels . 

with a cool cast and crew ( michael bay as director , jerry bruckheimer and gale anne hurd as producers , and j . j . abrams as one of the scriptwriters . ) , tons of special effects , great humor , awesome music , plus an intro done by mr . ben-hur himself , charlton heston , armageddon rocks big time .

parental warnings : this is not a film for kids . the f-bomb is used a few times and lots of other swear words are used as well , plus there ' s a strip bar scene and the extremely intense second part might be too hard for a kid to handle .   ' ernest saves christmas ' is comedian ernest ' s christmas special film . in this film , ernest has to find a successor to santa claus in order for christmas to continue . along the way , he meets a young girl who is a thief and who ends up stealing something very important of santa ' s ( i won ' t tell you what that is ; you ' ll just have to watch the film for yourself ) . like most ernest films , there is a lot of slapstick humor involved . 

this film is probably one of ernest ' s best films . it ' s funny , and it has some important lessons to learn regarding friendship and family and not being afraid to show love . it ' s not the best christmas film around , but it is a good one to get you in the christmas spirit . it ' s a little bit sad that the film is a little dated now .  as usual , leader leo gorcey ( as slip mahoney ) and " the bowery boys " are hard-pressed for cash . after unsuccessfully trying to sell their old jalopy , the lads look for help at the local bank . there , hapless huntz hall ( as sach ) has his picture taken by pretty photographer teala loring ( as cathy smith ) . but , since the shot was snapped during a robbery , it makes mr . hall look like the prime suspect . with pals bobby jordan ( as bobby ) , william " billy " benedict ( as whitey ) , and david gorcey ( as chuck ) ; mr . gorcey wants to clear hall , and collect the $ 1 , 000 reward money . " bowery bombshell " goes through the motions , with ms . loring a main strength . 

 * * * * bowery bombshell ( 7 / 20 / 46 ) phil karlson ~ leo gorcey , huntz hall , teala loring , bobby jordan tony curtis and skip homier both are wearing black with white trim canvas shoes in the scenes just before and after the swimming pond and the tank being blown up . must have been too hard on the young stars feet . if the real marines had been on the mission they would have been wearing boots . in the first scenes they took off their leggin ' s just before starting out on their little trip to find the farmer . when they went to the area where they dug the fox holes tony and skip are wearing combat boots , then later when lovejoy and curtis run into the framer and his daughter tony is wearing the " tennis shoes " but hey have been blacken . the movie in about a true story but did they really need the love interest ? ?  artificial melodrama with a screenplay adapted by mel dinelli from his play " the man " concerns a boarding-house proprietress taking in a troubled handyman who may be homicidal . despite solid work from ida lupino and robert ryan ( both trying their best ) , this tedious yarn isn ' t very inventive within its one primary set ( which quickly becomes visually dull ) and underpopulated cast of characters ( there is however a smart pooch who senses the worst ! ) . hokey and humorless , with a stilted direction from harry horner ( perhaps lupino should have directed ? ) . where ' s all the suspense promised by the ads ? dinelli also served as a co-producer . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  one of a few movies filmed at coronado high school in scottsdale , az in the late 80 ' s as well as just one of the guys , bill and ted ' s excellent adventure and just perfect ( which was a segmented movie played during the mickey mouse club . ) movie is definitely for kids as the previous comments have it pretty right on . 

coronado has gone through an overhaul in the past couple of years and many of the buildings seen in this film are now gone . the field where they are playing catch is adjacent to the football field , one of the few areas still there . the internal scenes near the lockers i believe were in the old 200 building . 

unless it is playing late at night on the disney channel it may be a very hard to find flick . how they ever made sequels to this is beyond me .  despite strong performances by minnie driver and tom wilkinson , this film fails to ignite the imagination of the viewer . 

by the way , what has become of ms . driver ? she had such a potential in the film industry . 

this to me was almost like an 1850s version of yentl without the musical fanfare . with the death of her father , driver takes a position as a governess to a christian family , hiding her jewish identity . 

while i realize that this is a period peace , it was awfully dull even for 1850 england and scotland . 

the lady of the house is most irritating with that sing-song voice of hers . i expected her to refer to driver as dear at any moment . what kind of name is mary blackchurch ? i know that driver is trying to pass herself off as a christian , but does this name signify all the way ? 

in the interim , mary finds love with the young charge ' s father ( wilkinson ) and his emotionally unbalanced son . 

in the end , the only thing that we see accomplished is that mary has found a profession to provide for her family-photography . did we really have to be subjected to what was happening throughout the film ? 

the early scenes of judaism practiced in 19th century england and the cholera epidemic at the end could have been played up more . there is a definite underlying feeling of anti-semitism by the wilkinson family but that ' s never allowed to come out .  as a big jim carey fan i took my seat in the cinema with optimism . after all , fun with dick and jane appeared to have all the raw materials to make this another carey success . after the opening five minutes of good humour it seemed that this film would provide but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in . the idea that a charming , charismatic , top v . i . p employee could suddenly find himself turning up to work in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get your head round the fact that this guy has also become a master criminal is virtually impossible . the actors seem confused with the situation as well . of course , the stereotypical , rich , uncaring head of the operation doesn ' t struggle one bit to pull off his one dimensional character but for carey and others around him the job is a whole lot harder . one minute dick is seen as a cocky office pro , obsessed with possessions , the next minute he ' s a bumbling mess who can barely string two words together , and ultimately he becomes a petty thief who is able , quite happily , to put a gun to another man ' s head . jane is equally confused with her role and her character never really gets going . 

the idea behind the story is such a good one and it is a shame that this film has not managed to make it work . the odd moment of laugh out loud comedy can be found but it is usually more physical humour than anything witty or clever . carey tries his best in parts to save a sinking ship but his comic talent can never flourish in a character that has so many gaping holes to his personality . carey shines when he is presented with a strong , daring character ( man on the moon , the truman show , ace ventura ) which this film never presented him with , despite its best efforts .  i seemed to find the trailers better than the movie . they did their job and made me interested in watching unknown . the interest waned early . a simple premise laking in scenery . five men wake up in a chemical warehouse not knowing why they are there ; let alone know how in the hell they got there . confusion and paranoia brings with it fear and distrust . the men learn that a kidnapper is on his way with plans to kill his hostages . now the men size each other up trying to distinguish if all are victims and who may actually be one of the kidnappers . the cast includes : jim caviezel , greg kinnear , joe pantoliano , bridget moynahan , barry peppper , david selby and adam rodriguez .  after the suicide of his father , charlie ' kid ' davis ( ray `boom boom ' mancini ) accepts the invitation and advice of his friend tiny ( michael chiklis ) and travels to las vegas with him trying to become a boxer . on the road , they meet gina ( jennifer beals ) hitchhiking , they give a lift to her and she becomes charlie ' s girlfriend . johnny ticotin ( rod steiger ) is convinced by tiny to be charlie ' s couch , and the powerful agent alex dumas ( joe mantegna ) , after watching him fighting , becomes his manager , promoting charlie ' s career . this movie is so boring that it indeed does not deserve to spend much time writing about it . i do not like boxing , but sometimes i watch some worthwhile movie about this theme . but this one is horrible ! predictable , full of clichÃ©s , having an awful lead actor , a pure waste of time . my vote is three . 

title ( brazil ) : `corpo e alma ' ( `body and soul ' )  bette midler is the best thing about this movie . it is a poor second to the original from 1962 with natalie wood as gypsy . the songs were done much better in the original and the costumes were better . bette ' s voice was great and she looked better in most of the costumes compared to cynthia gibb . only someone who has not seen the original would think this a good movie . 

there was not enough of a change between ugly duckling to beautiful girl . when natalie wood was gypsy she only was seen as beautiful when she got into the dress with her gloves for the first time to perform in the burlesque show . when she has her hair down and then magically it is all done up beautifully and she looks so elegant , it is an important aspect to the movie because it is also the first time gypsy sees herself as something special and that she might actually be a star , not just a poor substitute to her sister . and the scenes where she slowly becomes more famous were rushed through . it was an important part of the movie and they butchered it . it is critical to show her becoming more comfortable with her future as a stripper and the costumes are amazing in these scenes in the original . it was a huge let down to watch it unfold in this movie . i was completely disappointed and had it not been for bette midler i would have shut the movie off .  this is unique in films of hitchcock ' s that i ' ve seen , in that i didn ' t really enjoy it . 

in fact , i actually found this quite predictable and annoying . 

cary grant and joan fontaine are a newly married couple . he ' s the kind of " lovable rogue " character that you ' ve seen in many films , without ever being lovable as far as i am concerned ! 

in fact , it was a barely believable relationship at best , and at times seemed particularly false and implausible . 

unable to hold down a job and trying to live an opulent lifestyle , grant is led to borrow money that he cannot pay back . 

fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her in order to get the money she is insured for ; and presumably what her late father was worth . 

average and rather uninteresting all round actually , but as usual you can see the influence on films that have come at a later date .  no one is going to mistake the squall for a good movie , but it sure is a memorable one . once you ' ve taken in myrna loy ' s performance as nubi the hot-blooded gypsy girl you ' re not likely to forget the experience . when this film was made the exotically beautiful miss loy was still being cast as foreign vixens , often asian and usually sinister . she ' s certainly an eyeful here . it appears that her skin was darkened and her hair was curled . in most scenes she ' s barefoot and wearing little more than a skirt and a loose-fitting peasant blouse , while in one scene she wears nothing but a patterned towel . i suppose i ' m focusing on miss loy ' s appearance because she is by far the best if not the only reason to tune in to this creaky antique and to keep watching . you sure won ' t be attracted by the dialogue , which is hopeless . in one typical passage , nubi gazes out the window at the departing caravan and waxes poetic : " always the gypsies , they sing . weird and sad . when the big sun have breath of fire that burn , and when the pale moon look from behind cloud and breathe air cold as death , they sing . " poetic , or what ? lovers of purple prose will have a field day . i can ' t help but wonder , though , if in her later years miss loy preferred not to recall her involvement with this project . 

like so many early talkies this one was an adaptation of a recent broadway success . the stage version opened at the 48th street theatre in november of 1926 and ran for over a year . the play provoked a famous episode involving the humorist and theater critic robert benchley , who was known to have an aversion to characters who spoke in thick dialect or pidgin english . according to a much-repeated anecdote mr . benchley squirmed uncomfortably through the opening portion of this show . the spanish village setting ( moved to a village in hungary for the movie , for some reason ) gave the actors leeway to practice their accents with varying degrees of success , but benchley ' s patience reached its limit when , during a family dinner sequence , a door burst open and an actress dressed as a gypsy girl dashed into the room shouting " help ! help ! he keel me ! " she then threw herself at the feet of the mistress of the household and exclaimed " me nubi ! me good girl ! me stay here ! " at that point mr . benchley rose and announced to his companion : " me bobby . me bad boy . me go now , " and left the theater . 

the film version offers numerous examples of unintended humor but never comes close to benchley ' s level of wit . the melodramatic plot concerns the lajos family : father josef , mother maria , and son paul , a student at the nearby college . we would consider this prosperous family " upper-middle class " as they are landowners with servants and all the comforts of life , but their comfortable existence is abruptly thrown into turmoil when a gypsy caravan arrives in the village and their home is invaded by , yes , nubi the nubile gypsy girl . she arrives at their door during the storm of the title-- symbolizing stormy emotions , i daresay . the girl is fleeing an abusive relationship and begs for sanctuary . after considering the matter the lajos family agrees to hide her from her angry lover , who shows up shortly afterward but is turned away . nubi becomes a servant in the household . kindness motivates the family ' s decision to take her in , but soon enough that conniving little good-for-nothing nubi has paid them back by seducing every able-bodied male in the vicinity , starting with the lajos ' servant peter , then working her way up to son paul . nubi breaks up paul ' s relationship with his fiancÃ© irma ( played by loretta young , still a teenager ) , causes him to flunk out of school , and then prompts him to buy her jewelry by stealing the savings of the family ' s maid lena ( zasu pitts ) . lena , for her part , is still mourning the loss of her own fiancÃ© peter , seduced and tossed aside by nubi when she turned her attentions to paul . ultimately nubi sets her sights on the pater familias josef , and i suppose if the running time had been longer she also would ' ve gone after uncle dani , maria , the village priest and god knows who else . 

i guess it goes without saying that a scenario like this one easily lends itself to parody , but during its first half the squall nonetheless exerts the undeniable fascination of a daytime soap : we watch , hypnotized , as the bad girl works her spell on the men-folk and wreaks havoc like an irresistible force of nature ( almost like-- a storm ! ah-haa , another metaphor ! ) . but as the plot machinations grind on the campy fun fades . during the later scenes nubi is de-emphasized and the focus switches to the dysfunctional dynamics of the lajos family , and after awhile these people get to be a real drag . the son in particular behaves like an absolute heel , yet the parents never acknowledge this or face up to their own shortcomings ; everything , we ' re told , is the fault of nubi , that no-good tramp . 

the men of the cast are dull . aside from miss loy the only actress who can handle performing in talkies is zasu pitts , terrific as usual . the mother of the lajos household is played by alice joyce , a longtime silent star who was out of her element with speaking roles , and who retired soon after this . loretta young ' s fresh prettiness provides a nice contrast to nubi ' s dusky allure , but her line readings are so awkward it ' s kind of endearing . no , there ' s only one reason to watch this flick , and that ' s nubi herself . i can ' t think of another actress who could ' ve played this silly role and managed to come off half as well . i ' m not an objective observer , however . i have a desperate crush on myrna loy and will watch her in anything , even the squall .  the series does not start as it means to go on . although it ' s first two seasons are crammed with incredibly average episodes , as well as numerous duds , afterwards the pace picks up and one of the finest space operas is born . the first ever episode of star trek : the next generation is remarkable for two things : it ' s hugely enjoyable introductions to all of the main cast , and marina sirtis ' peculiar accent which would later disappear . seeing how it all began is very satisfying , and viewed in mind of the rest of the series , rather moving actually . otherwise it is a very mediocre episode featuring q , and some giant jellyfish . that ' s right .  the peace and beauty of koyaanisqatsi was a powerful affirmation of the natural world . in naqoyqatsi , we are assaulted by images of the synthetic , the competitive , the violent , and the digital -- the destructive constructs of our culture . 

some liberties are taken with the images , with posterization , distressing , and much slow motion . the connections between the sequences are inscrutable , if there are any . naqoyqatsi is defined at the film ' s end , a missed opportunity to place the images in context . 

the film is difficult to watch , the quality of the archival footage uneven , and it ' s most redeeming qualities are its theme and the hypnotic score of philip glass .  the movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the stooges . the story is told from the point of view of moe howard and his relationships with his brothers shemp and jerome ( curly ) howard , also the life long friendship with larry fine . the movie deals mostly with the off camera high points and pit falls of the stooges multi decade career . the casting director and makeup artist did a fair job of finding actors who resembled the famous ensemble . the actor who plays " curly " howard did a fine job of portraying the on camera antics of the most beloved stooge . a must see for any fan of three stooges shorts .   " the yoke ' s on me " is undoubtedly the most controversial film in the stooges ' 23 years of shorts . the reason is understandable ; by today ' s standards , this film can be considered racist . for this reason , it is rarely shown , if ever , on television . 

let me just state that , for the record , the japanese seen in the film were not soldiers ; they were japanese-americans sent to a relocation center during world war ii . they were treated and shown as the evil enemy in this film . by all accounts - including the us government , who made an apology and reparations in the 1980s - japanese-americans during world war ii were as loyal and hardworking as any american . their imprisonment during this time is a dark blot in american history . 

there are some stooge laughs in this film , but the memories of how japanese-americans were treated during this time sullies the entertainment value . let ' s not confuse the loyal japanese-americans with their representation in this film as evildoers . loyal japanese-americans and the world war ii-era evil empire of japan are not synonymous . 2 out of 10 .  they have taken a story dear to the people of edinburgh ' s heart , a true story and changed it as hollywood has done before to many a tale . the end result is a movie however well done for those how do not know the story yet totally different and inaccurate . the original movie of this tale that walt disney himself oversaw used the right breed dog that is crucial for this tale and did not make that john grey was anything special he was a poor shepard who died in poverty at the inn . if you like the story , watch the disney original for a better heart- warming story . it ' s a shame the cast and the potential was there for a terrific remake of a classic tale . read the book for an accurate occurrence of the story . and if you really like it , you can visit the real kirkyard in edinburgh .  henry ( don ameche ) turns up at the entrance to hell and recounts his life story to his excellency ( laird cregar ) . the story focuses on his relationships with females throughout his life , and in particular , his relationship with martha ( gene tierney ) . at the end of the film , we cut back to henry and his excellency for a very predictable ending . 

unfortunately , there is nothing more to say about the film because nothing happens . its a sentimental story of one man ' s life and its very boring . i watched it with my girlfriend and my dad and we all thought it was rubbish , despite the lubitsch touch . i yawned more than 15 times . hugo ( charles coburn ) is good whenever he is on screen as the grandfather and there were a few funny moments of dialogue . the colour made it a good spectacle but it wasn ' t enough to save this plodder from going into the reject pile . in the same mould as " its a wonderful world " and " you can ' t take it with you " , and so , not surprisingly , it was nominated for an oscar . a story about ordinary people , none of whom are interesting and with no storyline of any interest . boring , sentimental and the biggest damp squib of an ending that i can remember . . .  since the magus is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution , one should sit back and enjoy the scenery . set on a " remote greek island , " it stars a very uptight michael caine as a teacher working at a school for boys who gets caught up in mind games with local wacko / mystery man anthony quinn and his daffy girlfriend candice bergen . quinn , looking like pablo picasso with white hair and striped sailor shirt , is actually pretty good but caine looks like he ' s ready to explode . bergen , although stunning , should not put on a british accent ever . she ' s not very good at that type of thing . guy green ' s direction is fine , but unless you have infinite patience with the circular logic of the film , you will not enjoy it . a real sour note is the casting of the effervescent anna karina in the completely joyless role of caine ' s girlfriend . after seeing her in the likes of a woman is a woman and a band apart , her presence here is quite jarring .  norman wisdom ' s final starring vehicle was a departure from his previous outings Â bringing his accident-prone milquetoast up-to-date , this being a product of the swinging sixties ! the end result is an uneasy and occasionally embarrassing comedy which mixes the star ' s typical slapstick ( and sentimentality ) with mild sexuality and even milder satire ; the plot has to do with an executive on a trip for a banking conference falling for teenager sally geeson ( who doesn ' t mind getting involved with him but doesn ' t take their relationship all that seriously either ) ; sarah atkinson appears as geeson ' s friend who warns norman of her fickle character . 

the film is nowhere near as bad as leonard maltin ' s bomb rating would have it and , if anything , is interesting for its treatment of mid-life crisis ( being in many ways similar to hoffman [1970] and 10 [1979] Â both of which , incidentally , i ' ve only just watched ) ; towards the end , norman even tries to bring his wife round to his new way of thinking ! the pretty things appear as themselves performing a number of good tunes in a nightclub and norm himself sings the catchy title track !  dryly irreverent , but sadly unfunny satire of detective movies , with stony-faced michael caine playing a british author of trashy crime stories traveling to the mediterraean to assist in writing the memoirs of a would-be gangster ; soon , he realizes he ' s being followed and his life is in danger . caine narrates the proceedings with considerable sly wit and low-keyed sarcasm , but his actual performance is bereft of energy ( caine ' s shrill bursts of anger or frustration seem to come out of nowhere , and he connects with nobody on the screen ) . other cast members ( particularly mickey rooney , a silver-haired lionel stander , and lizabeth scott ) do very well in colorfully outrÃ© roles , though al lettieri has an insulting part as an apparent cross-dressing homosexual ( lettieri gets insulted without being able to defend himself , an unenviable position ) . writer-director mike hodges has the germ of a good idea ( satirize the detective movies of the 1940s without compromising the hard-boiled talk and milieu ) , but he hasn ' t a very sharp sense of humor . when a bogart lookalike--asking a question about a falcon--is the best joke , what follows is anemic indeed . * * from * * * *  the movie opens with a scene that simply could not be . a man wakes up and while his wife remains in bed , he begin his morning prayers in his bedroom while his wife sleeps peacefully . morning blessings are recited , but only the ones gitai finds controversial . the rest are conveniently omitted . then while in philactories and a tallis he kisses his wife good morning ! ! this is not an accurate depiction of jewish prayer in any home , let alone a chassidic home . amos gittai is not interested in accurately portraying chassidic life . he is interested in adding to his ever growing list of melodramatic and empty films . the mikka ( ritual bath ) scenes are far from accurate and his jewish wedding was laughable as it does not even approach the atmosphere of a chassidic wedding . i have many problems with the chassidic way of life , but i have no use for amos gittai ' s commentary on these issues . he would have you think that the chassidim are all dense comformists with severe bouts of depression . i may not agree with the chassidic lifestyle , but i acknowledge that chassidic life has many layers . amos gitai is blinded by his own secularist pseudo-intellectual stubborness and is therefore , incapable of portraying an accurate depiciton of chassidic life . aside from his poor research and unbalanced portrayal of chassidic life , gitai fails in other aspects as well . the plot is full of holes , the dialogue loaded with silence , the soundtrack is too repetitive and the acting while at times powerfull was too often loaded with melodrama . the movie drags on and on and the ending is not worth sticking around for . watch if you must , but be warned . if you want to learn about chassidic life go to the communities and talk to chassidim . do not rely on gittai ' s film !  i guess i should now comment upon a 4th flick in the magnificent seven franchise ; the sequels still surprise or amaze meÂby their sleaze and deliberate _absurdism . they constitute or forge a 4th wayÂnot classic , not revisionist , not europeanÂbut a sleaze americana , kindred to the violent vigilante ' 70s movies , absurd trash . this installment too is bombastic sleazeÂinexplicably awkward and even somewhat strange . 

now what i find disturbing that these sequels not only have their opportunist fans ; but that the fans simply do not sense any difference between the original ' s style and the sequels ' . 

these sequels are not boring or insipidÂbut bizarre . they are of course very badly writtenÂmessy scripts , rubbish lines . it ' s straight crazy ; in this installment each gunman gets several womenÂ van cleef ' s young wife begs him to release a young prisoner ; he finally does . the young man resumes his life , shoots van cleef , kidnaps the wife , rapes and kills herÂthen joins a wrongdoer . van cleef , who has previously refused to help defending a village , now assembles a small bunch and charges the wrongdoer ' s hacienda ; then the wrongdoers charge the village where van cleef has set . 

i liked the cast . 

van cleef is chris ; stefanie powers , pretty active in the ' 70s screwy westerns , is van cleef ' s darling . callan , very antipathetic , is noah , a writer and chris ' sidekick . the rest of the aggressive bunch are askew ( one of the only three survivors ) , armendariz , lucking , lauter ; rita rogers is truly hot , fleshy beauty .  a movie about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town on its ear should be fun , romantic and easy-going entertainment . instead this movie is more about things not said and not expressed , so it gets to the point where you are grateful anything is said at all , even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable . 

spoiler --

when the relationship that says the most is the one least seen on the screen ( danner and mcewan ) , you know you ' re in trouble . but those two actresses are a very welcome sight in a movie screaming for some genuine people . 

end of spoiler

capshaw is given the task of creating a character from not much and she is not entirely successful . like i said above , the theme seems to be repression and i understand that is an element of life and love but i don ' t want to see a movie about it either , at least not this one . 

i can ' t recommend this at all , despite the very talented cast who are left to fend for themselves .  i can remember reading that darwin had a pivotal experience in the galapagos islands , seeing the vast range of animal life there , and intern , penned his theory of evolution . not according to this movie-it was inspired by the british countryside . ok , and as john cleese would say-right- . i also did not think that darwin was a man suffering from deep personal conflict and someone who suffered dark reveries and flights of anguish . according to this film he was . it is sad that he apparently lost one of his daughters to illness , but i don ' t think him losing a family member would have impacted on the mans scientific abilities very much . well , not according to . . . you get the picture . i think there is nothing worse than when science gets turned into fable , and to an extent this film comes off as trying to debunk evolutionary theory by saying it came from a man who was emotionally unstable , which to me , is just plain gross . i think charles darwin was the soul of scientific enquiry , cool and calm , and always thinking logically . this film seeks to dramatize the undramatic and sensationalize clear headed scientific exploration . it is like a canterbury tale . i would not recommend it .  a romp across a disbelieving outback , this outragous adventure enchants through it ' s downright brazeness . comedy from the clashing confrontation of cultural assumptions - as drama from crisis . perhaps a little too queenie for some - i would love to have watched in a cinema audience in the outback . shockingly good why does the poster & artwork say " clubbed is one of the best uk indie films i have seen in a very long time . screen international " when it was a quote of the french distributor reported by screen international ( an influential film trade publication ) . see www . screendaily . com / screendailyarticle . aspx ? intstoryid=39811 which reads : 

 " pretty pictures has acquired all french-speaking rights to neil thompson ' s clubbed . . . . james velaise , president of pretty pictures , said : " clubbed is one of the best uk indie films i have seen in a very long time . " " 

isn ' t this rather misleading ? the distributor is bound to say it ' s good . are the other quotes real ?  to begin with , i really love lucy . her tv show still makes me laugh . she was one of the greatest comedians who ever lived , right up there with chaplin and keaton . but , her performance in this movie is disappointing . she was too old , and the gauze filters on the lens make her look like a london fog refugee . she couldn ' t sing , and her voice was so froggy that she croaked through every song . her dancing days were long in the past . just because you are a lucy fan , don ' t gloss over this mistaken , sad performance and sing it ' s praises . i prefer to remember lucy in her wonderful tv series ( i love lucy ) and to draw the curtain of charity over the terrible mess of a movie called " mame " .  there must be an error . this movie belongs with " plan 9 " , and a lot others as a quite entertaining , silly diversion . you ' ll never accept you like it , yet you will watch it whenever it comes out on tv . it ' s as simple as that .  it is impossible to avoid comparing zhang yimou ' s `hero ' to ang lee ' s `crouching tiger , hidden dragon . ' they were both big-budget chinese kung-fu films with breathtaking cinematography of chinese landscape and a cast of super-stars . but aside from the obvious , there is in fact nothing else to compare . `hero ' fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters , proving that big-name stars , beautiful scenery , and action effects are no replacement for a director ' s artistry and vision . 

all the marketing hype preceding the premier of `hero ' has done nothing more than make its failure a spectacular one . much anticipated , `hero ' drew movie-goers in throngs when it first opened at theaters in mainland china and hong kong , making it an instant box-office success . however , though the script pleased government censors , chinese audiences went to newfound heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their disdain . on-line critics , both professional and amateur , proclaimed the film `ideologically disturbing , ' `from the viewpoint of deep servitude , ' written `either by an amateur historian , or someone with ulterior motives . ' one article was simply titled , `hero , you make me sick ! ' 

the deepest failing of the film is in its plot , which is not only morally reprehensible , and based on unforgivable historic fallacy but - worst of all for a film - is boring ! all blockbuster epic films are known to take some liberties with the facts of history , but `hero ' goes beyond artistic license into unforgivable ignorance when it attempts to glorify an emperor that was as brutal as stalin or hitler . `hero ' does not make up for this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or fun . instead , it is makes a woefully poor attempt at being `deep ' and merely manages to be pretentious and preachy . 

though historians agree that the first emperor of china was ruthlessly violent , mao zedong was known to have admired this ruler - no surprise , given mao ' s own tyrannical rule . likewise , the communist government in beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the first emperor and its own iron-fist methods , so they were particularly pleased with this latest work by zhang yimou . tony leung , one of the stars of `hero ' remarked during an interview to promote the film that the beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 by crushing the student demonstrations , because it was needed to maintain `stability ' in china . for these remarks , tony leung received shocked criticisms in his home city of hong kong , but he merely stated out loud the underlying message of the movie . 

director zhang yimou has stated that his goal was to surpass the values of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung-fu novels and movies , to reveal a higher wisdom . unfortunately , his version of `wisdom ' turns out to be : the oppressor is right . in china , where thousands of years of historical reality have rammed this message through , art was the last sanctuary where the individual could actually find freedom from such tyranny . the great popularity of the kung-fu novel can be explained by its ability to provide an escape into an alternate world : one where kung-fu warriors roamed the country seeking adventure and fighting for justice , free from fear and winning against all odds with their super-human skills . only in the novel did the individual ever win over institutionalized power in china , and only in the novel did the oppressed find their champions . going against this tradition of the kung-fu hero , zhang yimou has not gone upwards towards a higher truth , as he had hoped , but downwards , to the level of government propaganda . it ' s no wonder the government was so pleased . 

some film lovers may secretly wonder , `all moralistic judgments aside , is it at least entertaining ? ' fortunately , the answer is a resounding `no ! ' because the same tale is told over and over with only slight variations , it becomes tedious to watch . moreover , the three conflicting versions of the same story serves only to confuse the character development , since it leaves precious little time for the viewer to feel any sympathy for any of them once the `real ' version emerges . 

the film is not without its beautiful images . however , all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect to or enhance the storyline . the use of different colors to distinguish the separate versions of the tale comes across as simplistic and contrived , and the cinematography appears self-consciously rather than truly beautiful . great for a trailer , but a disappointment once you are there to watch the entire film . 

for those in china who showed disdain for `crouching tiger ' s ' unrealistic kung-fu , much was expected from `hero . ' jet li , who plays the title role , is a real kung-fu artist who held national titles before beginning his career as an actor . his previous movies have revealed limited acting abilities , but many hoped that zhang yimou could use li ' s lithe body movements to full effect while casting him properly in a role that would not task his acting abilities . but it was not to be . `hero ' attempts to go beyond the kung-fu genre , so there are not many fighting scenes , and jet li is expected to perform a difficult piece of acting : an inner transformation leading to profound wisdom and self-sacrifice . as the casting director ought to have expected , li fails miserably . meanwhile , the only fighting scene that reveals any true kung-fu skill is the first one of the film , between li and and donnie yen . all the scenes that follow are a disappointment , so `hero ' fails to satisfy , even on that level . 

though most audiences outside china are unlikely to be aware of the historical mangling of the story of the cruel first emperor , it seems even more unlikely that they would accept zhang ' s version of `chinese wisdom , ' which is anything but . perhaps the only time an audience coming out of a screening of `hero ' was seen smiling - instead of yawning or frowning - was at the special screening for chinese government officials . 

 hollywood has made a lot of strange movies over the years , but none stranger than this . why this movie got made i will never know , nor how paramount could have thought it would sell any tickets in 1947 . it is the strangest mix of genres i have seen in a long time , a movie that truly does not know whether it is trying to be a serious war drama or a viennese operetta comedy . 

it tells the story of a british spy trying to get a poison gas formula out of germany in the days just before ww ii began . ray milland , a fine actor , is stuck playing the part like an escapee from monty python , all very exaggerated english prep-school dialogue . in germany he meets a gypsy , marlene dietrich , who helps him to travel under cover as , of course , another gypsy . she plays her part like the typical viennese operetta gypsy caricature , as do the other " gypsies " in the movie . but there are also nazis , who are not funny at all . and then milland finds he is starting to think like a gypsy , and that is not treated as a joke . sometimes the music is for a light comedy , sometimes for a drama . every time the nazis show up , the film score plays wagner , which is funny by itself . 

this movie could have been a comedy , or it could have taken the plight of the gypsies seriously and done a serious job of showing how the nazis treated them . both are hinted at in this movie , but neither pursued . what we are left with is a truly strange mish-mash of genres that must have embarrassed everyone ( except the director ) involved . 

bizarre .  the only reason this movie is not given a 1 ( awful ) vote is that the acting of both ida lupino and robert ryan is superb . ida lupino who is lovely , as usual , becomes increasingly distraught as she tries various means to rid herself of a madman . robert ryan is terrifying as the menacing stranger whose character , guided only by his disturbed mind , changes from one minute to the next . seemingly simple and docile , suddenly he becomes clever and threatening . ms . lupino ' s character was in more danger from that house she lived in and her own stupidity than by anyone who came along . she could not manage to get out of her of her own house : windows didn ' t open , both front and back doors locked and unlocked from the inside with a key . you could not have designed a worse fire-trap if you tried . she did not take the precaution of having even one extra key . nor could she figure out how to summon help from nearby neighbors or get out of her own basement while she was locked in and out of sight of her captor . i don ' t know what war her husband was killed in , but if it was world war ii , the furnishings in her house , the styles of the clothes , especially the children and the telephone company repairman ' s car are clearly anachronistic . i recommend watching this movie just to see what oddities you can find .  i actually belong to the demographic zoey 101 specifically is trying to target , so i can see that as much as it tries to be relatable to people my age , the premise is simply too ludicrous for an average person to relate to . the show revolves around the wealthiest boarding school in existence , and the lovely , incredibly tan , attractive gang of one-sided characters who inhabit it . as is the tradition amongst kids networks , the cast is an array of skinny white kids , with the token black guy , of course . 

the story lines all revolve around zoey and her gang of friends stumbling upon or creating some sort of minor dilemma , such as not wanting to attend gym class , resulting in zoey devising a scheme to save the day for all her friends . there is generally a b-line revolving around either a one- sided guest character , or placing supporting characters in completely unrealistic situations , such as having a hive of wasps in a dorm room and no one noticing . these plots often play off stereotypes , such as any character who pulls good grades in math must by default completely lack social skills . the majority of episodes have the continuous and overused will-they won ' t-they chase-zoey dynamic . 

the characters , unfortunately , are all incredibly one-sided ; there is zoey , the perfect girl with a solution to literally everything , chase , the constantly lovesick still but rather endearing best friend , michael , the token black guy ( kudos to christopher massey for managing some genuinely funny one-liners ) , lola , the theater chick ( meaning she dies her hair and 75 % of her dialogue is about her dreams of stardom , despite the fact that she never does anything in the actual theater ) , logan , the womanizing narcissist , dustin , the spazzy little brother , and quinn , the science geek . the few words i spent on each of these characters sum up each character entirely . 

zoey 101 does manage to be entertaining at times , but the serious flaws in the system of values it promotes are a major turnoff . zoey , who is set up as the obvious role model and quasi-feminist crusader and who is on the surface portrayed as flawless , still manages major character flaws . for example , when lola was first introduced , she was believed to be a goth girl . zoey tried to use this as an excuse to kick her out of their shared dorm room for being " freaky " . 

as for the acting , it is quite clear that jamie lynn spears landed this role because of her name , not because of talent . although she has definitely improved as time goes by , it is clear she is not a born actress , which greatly affects the quality of the show , as most of the plot lines revolve around her character . the supporting cast is surprisingly good , especially considering the material they have to work with . they deliver quite a few good one-liners for comic relief , if the plot hasn ' t yet ventured into obscurity . 

all in all , zoey 101 is a flawed view at high school life , and anyone past their limited too years shouldn ' t expect much from it .  this film with fine production values features secrets and how friends use each other . henry may long is a very well-acted , dimly lit , depressing turn-of-the-century period piece about a friendship between a fatally ill man and a melancholy , indebted junkie . talky drawing room dramas are not my cup of tea , and all the crying wears thin . recommended if you like independent , slyly intellectual , slow-paced merchant ivory-type features . 

i suspected that the main characters were in love , but their connection was so intimated , it didn ' t really have the emotional impact of ' brokeback mountain . ' it features some good writing with a scene discussing how to disappear in life , but it is truly a dark and depressing film .  stone has tried another type of movie . any given sunday falls short of a the above average the last boy scout and the below average against all odds . stone can be fantastic , see the doors , natural born killers or platoon but he can also repeat himself see nixon or born on the fourth of july . his real brilliance is realized in the michael caine perfection , the hand .  stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so i am happy to see any of their films . ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital , and with nothing else to do , stan decides to visit him , and take him some boiled eggs and nuts , instead of candy . chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollie ' s leg cast string , and manages to push the doctor ( billy gilbert ) out the window , clinging on to it , getting ollie strung up to the ceiling . when the situation calms down , stan gets ollie ' s clothes , as the doctor wants them both to leave , and he also manages to sit on a syringe , accidentally left by the nurse , filled with a sleeping drug , which comes into effect while he is driving ( which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen . filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad ( although repetitive and a little predictable ) classic comedy , it isn ' t great , but it ' s a black and white film worth looking at . stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians ' comedian . okay !  fear and desire is of interest mainly to kubrick obsessives , who can plumb this pretentious clap trap for signs of his still-to-come greatness . kubrick was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video . he considered it embarrassing and amateurish , and he was correct in his evaluation . this is a weak and tedious film--at 68 minutes it still seems longer than " barry lyndon " ! --it nevertheless is of historical interest , and has its genuine absorbing moments . it ' s a difficult film to find ( only " unofficial " copies are in circulation ) , though perhaps this may change if kubrick ' s estate relents and has it released on video . recommended only for kubrick enthusiasts .  up at the villa ( 2000 ) * * 1 / 2

warning : you may find some spoilers ahead

it ' s hard to know what is the point in up at the villa , a gorgeous but shallow period piece , one of those made with the only objective of earning oscar nominations for best costume design and art-set direction ( one for cinematography and another for score are also welcome ) . it has the same basic idea of thousands of period pieces produced every year : a good-looking , intelligent woman trying to find love in a strange place to her . she has many difficulties but ultimately finds her happiness in the arms of a man that is not the one that she had an accomplishment with . in this case , our lady is in florence , some time before world war ii . she is an english widow engaged to a rich-but-old man ( whom , obviously , she doesn ' t love ) . one day she meets another man , who has not a good reputation but for whom she falls in love . of course there is her friend who will help her for better or worse and a third man- who commits suicide here , in the lady ' s room , setting up a risky situation for her . guess how the story ends . . . ? 

up at the villa is not a bad film . i was always quite interested in the story , but never got excited . the problem is not the slow pacing , but the screenplay . adapted from a novel , it needs something more spicy , exciting , twists and suspense . every time you think the story will get warm , it gets cooler again . if you think there is a conspiracy involving the mean police chief of florence , well , there is , but it doesn ' t change almost anything in the story . it just keeps going and going , till the predictable ending . 

as i said , up at the villa is not bad . if it is a bit bland , it never gets sappy and too sentimental . the acting is half and half , but surely convinces . kristin scott thomas made some really bad choices after the english patient ( the saaaaaaappy romantic drama the horse whisperer and the dull / irritating random hearts ) . up at the villa is undoubtly better than those pieces and kristin is also better , but she can do more than that . sean penn is good as always , even if his character is a big dude . anne bancroft is a terrific actress ( the graduate , my god ! ) , and here she doesn ' t let her character become ridiculous . now , the supporting actors are pretty bad ( jeremy davies is sooooooooooo irritating ! ) . 

the directing is good , but not audacious . it was interesting to know that the director is the same of angels and insects ( also starring kristin scott thomas ) , another so-so period drama , but more audacious than this . what matters here are the visuals . florence is wonderful , the costumes are great , the scenery , the music . . . 

in the end , up at the villa is an average romantic drama , but of course it could have been much better . it is watchable and interesting , but don ' t expect a suspense film- it is not ! this film kind of fails because it wants to have some mystery , something to behold . . . however , there is not much to say mainly because of the shallow screenplay . now , about the oscar nominations , don ' t worry- it will probably get them .  this is an admirable attempt from first time filmmaker ham tran , offering little-glanced perspective dealing with vietnam war victims struggling for liberation , but plays out as a glorified history special . with clunky , self-consciously informative dialog and sub-par acting , even a relatively impressive budget with attention to detail will not spring to life this sagging , albeit historically worthy , melodrama . paying no mind to the often distracting disconnect with the actors to the reality of situations on screen , and you should be left with an informative , if somewhat impersonal educational lesson in vietnamese post-war history .  while the david lynch version of dune is choppy , awkward , and unfaithful to the novel , it is visually well designed and well acted . the best one can say about the sci fi channel ' s attempt to make dune into a miniseries is that it ' s ambitious . actually , that is virtually the only positive praise one can offer . the actors ( with few exceptions ) seem happy to recite their lines with the least emotion possible , and the least appropriate accents . the costumes seem to have been designed by someone with a a large surplus of mylar fabric on hand and an unhealthy love of unflattering headwear . 

in part , this miniseries suffers from living in the shadow of lynch ' s already well known effort . however , it takes elements from lynch ' s film which were not present in the novel and copies them nearly wholesale ( i . e . the guild steersman ' s navigation sequence ) , and this only encourages encourages negative comparison to lynch ' s film . a for effort . d for virtually everything else .  your time and brains will be much better spent reading or listening to charlie wilson ' s war . phillip seymour hoffman , plays the most enjoyable character in the movie , gust , the greek , and he plays him as a eunuch . gust , in the book , is hard core and completely free to speak his mind . in the movie , he ' s not even shown as being equally important to charlie . and poor charlie is never shown donating blood ( which he did every time he visited the camps in pakistan ) . in short , the movie is too bland , and the history is too old for our modern time . we don ' t really care about the end of the cold war and the defeat of the soviet union ( which happened in spite of reagan , not as a result of ) by a well financed group of people who were extremely willing to fight . not quite the lesson we need to be hearing and seeing considering how well the wars in iraq and afghanistan are going . ( as i read the book , i kept getting that deja vu feeling , except it was present day ) .  the production year says it all . the movie is a marauding mess of politically correct leftwing feministic selfappreciating drivel , of a so heavyhanded symbolic variety that comes across as ridiculous today . every scene has the purpose of shedding light on one of the burning issues of society , mainly the role of females in the working community , the role of women vs men , women as sex objects , consumerism , politics , war , etc . every scene is commented upon by the inner dialogue of one of the main actresses , or by turning the scene into a surrealistic joke . i have no reminiscence of any plot , or who the main characters actually were . it is the sort of movie , where consumerism is mocked by having a couple make love in a furniture store sales window while the sales agent delivers his speech , or where a revealing interview of a stage actress turns into a fullblown striptease act , for " of course " the offensive gentlemen of the press is the equal to a raunchy club audience . then we move swiftly on , as we need to see war erupt in a peaceful forest , we need to see multiple inflammatory feministic public speeches being drowned in the ( male ) blowing of cars horns or rioting crowds , and of course we need to see cinema newsreels of stalin and all the other usual suspects . you get the idea . but all this does not matter at all . the movie is an unsurpassed piece of eyecandy for any ( male ) ingmar bergman aficionado . a movie boasting leads bibi andersson , harriet andersson and gunnel lindblom at the height of their beauty makes this reviewer surrender completely and just drivel Â and also delight in watching them so generously use their acting skills in a movie i had never heard about before today . it is hard to believe how especially the face of bibi andersson owns the screen every single time she appears . the cinematography is gorgeously orchestrated bw , often revelling in an overexposed ( ? ) dimensionless whitishness , and you just never grow tired of watching the performers . how absurd , that a movie made with so much consideration for the feministic agenda , tirelessly advocating that women should not be viewed as merely an object of desire , has nothing better to offer the 21st century viewer than a parade of stunningly beautiful babes . as mentioned , i am not complaining . i could rewatch it tomorrow .  attractive husband and wife writing team robert wagner ( as joel gregory ) and kate jackson ( as donna gregory ) arrive at the spooky mansion of actress " lorna love " ( actually , silent film star harold lloyd ' s house ) . mr . wagner and ms . jackson are contracted to write the silent movie star ' s biography . wagner has a personal interest in the project , since his father was once the famed star ' s lover . mysterious events unfold , and jackson must fight to save her husband from the spirit of the beautiful blonde , who is " perfectly preserved " in a crypt on the estate ; moreover , the evil woman seems bent on possessing her husband , and murdering jackson ! 

this is very much a " night of dark shadows " variation , co-starring genuine " dark shadows " alumni kate jackson , who knows and plays her part well . robert wagner lacks david selby ' s intensity . sylvia sidney ( as mrs . josephs ) sidesteps grayson hall . marianna hill is not a match for lara parker ( or diana millay ) . bill macy ( as oscar payne ) is good in a part that would have been played by john karlen ( in a dan curtis production ) . 

there are smooth cameos by joan blondell , john carradine , and dorothy lamour . ms . lamour ' s delivery resembles joan bennett , which begs the question : why didn ' t producer aaron spelling get more of the original " dark shadows " regulars ? 

director e . w . swackhamer was bridget hanley ' s husband ; he worked with ms . blondell on " here come the brides " , and with jackson on " the rookies " . " death at love house " has , arguably , a tighter storyline than the " night of dark shadows " film ; it differs in the movie star angle ; and , in its " father eternal fire " ending , it more closely resembles the tvseries ' " laura the phoenix " storyline . 

 * * * * death at love house ( 9 / 3 / 76 ) e . w . swackhamer ~ robert wagner , kate jackson , sylvia sidney having some idle time before going to work , i looked at my " 50 movie pack comedy classics " dvd collection and picked the most obscure title in the pack : zis boom bah starring a forgotten grace hayes . " classics " is obviously the operative word here since most of the titles i ' ve never heard of and i suspect they ' re all in the public domain . anyway , this movie also stars her son peter lind and his wife mary healy ( who i just found out is a new orleans native from the state i live in , louisiana ) with benny rubin as a malt shop proprietor and huntz hall , taking a break from the east side kids , as peter ' s buddy . the plot , about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible one with him unaware of who she is , is for the birds and doesn ' t have many funny scenes though i did like peter ' s celebrity impersonations and his dance with hall in drag . and the songs and dances are entertaining in themselves . rubin , however , is all over the place with his confusion of the american vernacular of the time and almost everything concerning him makes no sense whatsoever ( though i did like his funny dance ) . since this was only 61 minutes that i ' m sure played on the lower-half of the double feature bill , i ' ll be charitable and give this one a 3 for the few entertaining bits that i mentioned enjoying .  this sequel to the above - and the final entry in the " kharis " series - is slightly more enjoyable on the whole but it ' s also more contrived ( hell , we even get a singing barmaid / hostess ! ) : peter coe is easily the least charismatic of the various egyptian high priests we ' ve seen during the course of these films , and martin kosleck as his henchman seems uninterested in the proceedings ; kurt katch , then , is saddled with a ridiculous accent as the man who discovers the newly reincarnated princess ananka : the latter , in the form of virginia christine ( later a much-used character actress ) gets her most substantial ' role ' and , indeed , the sequence of her resurrection from the swamps is a highlight not only of this film but the entire series . unfortunately , here too , chaney has precious little to do as once again the emphasis is on ananka , as i ' ve said ; his mummy ( to which he returned most often at universal - apart , naturally , from his signature role of the wolf man ! ) remains , without a doubt , his least memorable monster for the studio .  again , like many other tv shows , a certain actor / actresses in thrust into the limelight , in this case miranda cosgrove , having built up her reputation in previous movies / series ( especially by nickelodeon and dan schneider . she is now the star of the show , gets to sing the soundtrack ( which she did not write and thus gets even more fame from that ) . wonderful ? it creates as much imbalance in popularity vs her other co-stars , especially nathan kress , who is continually thrust into minor rolls in each episode , except idont want to fight . cosgrove ' s music would never have met the charts without this show and her singing the main theme song ( which was not written by her ) and other covers such as about you now and stay my baby . let ' s not forget that she lip sync / sings her song live too . is that how you create vocalist nowadays ? 

back to the show , cosgrove reveals more physically by acting scenes in a bikini , hawaiian hula type bra and mentioned bra many times through out . bras and seen in many cases ( though not of the other actresses ) . wedgies are mentioned , panties have been mentioned once . og let us not forget " oh my god " a come phrase ( are any of the scriptwriters / actors christian ? ) granted that the show is not meant to be just for kids , i ' m surprised at the multitude of mentions of the female undergarment , especially in the first episode , where the phrase " pointy boobs " were mentioned . i ' m not sure whether kids would thus refrain from saying that at home / in school afterwards . 

it ' s not that i ' m against the mentioning or showing of female undergarments ( which girls will wear ) , but for a show from nickelodeon , the people in charge should have realised that kids would get the exposure to such stuff . i doubt that other nickelodeon shows have such content in them . 

as mentioned is other reviews , the laughter track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many parts--for example , when the character sam cries , how on earth is that a time to laugh ? it distracts people from getting the joke and is used almost in every sentence . 

as mentioned , cosgrove is made the star of the show and thus gains the utmost fame and support from die hard fans , who even scolded a hotel staff when she is told to keep her noise level down ( see http : / / www . youtube . com / watch ? v=kk0gtfuk98u ) . jennette mccurdy is the second star of the show but she faces competition from cosgrove in the music industry ( compare the popularity of her new single vs cosgrove ' s covers ) . as noted , the third co-star nathan kress is the least noted of the lot . he is portrayed as a atypical boy who suffers the brunt of bullying by a girl and other boys but somehow a wizard at technology . his height in early episodes make him a cute actor but unusual given his character ' s crush on carly / cosgrove . beyond that , kress isn ' t breaking into the music industry and as cosgrove ' s fame grows with each episode , kress falls behind . i would bet that he is the least paid of all the three actors . 

the content of the show is of course fictional , but also lets one wonder how it fits into a comedy series at certain times ( thus the laughter track is used ) . it also contains several continuity errors ( how can your father be and air force colonel on a submarine ? us special forces have their own branches , and the air force doesn ' t use us submarines--that is for seals ) . a unique feature is that of allowing viewers to submit their own videos to be shown during or after the episodes , but again the videos somehow do not meet the theme of comedy . 

once again , it is a show that is riddled with mentions of the female undergarments , exposure of skin , and over used laughter tracks . it is a series which thrusts a teen actress so far into the crowd such that her songs / actions are excessive supported by her fans , leaving her co stars behind .  this hbo original is pretty straightforward and pretty dumb . armand assante , once again doing a poor stallone imitation , is ray wellman a ex-con just out on parole . all he wants is his old girlfriend lacy , played by a young marcia gay harden , back . unfortunately for ray , lacy has hooked up with stalwart elliot , played by sam neill . further complicating matters is that ray ' s old cell buddies want some favors and they kidnap lacy to make sure they happen . ray and elliot team up , despite mutual dislike . 

what follows is violent and slow , but marcia gay harden shows us why she would win oscar in the future , she ' s not as polished here , but her raw emotion , sincerity and some rather explicit nude scenes almost make this worth watching . almost . 

rent " fever " ( no the title doesn ' t fit the film ) if your a fan of hers , otherwise skip it and be grateful it ' s stars went on to better things . 

note-this is a hard " r " flick for language , violence and nudity .  i have to differ from the other comments posted . amid sporadic funny moments , there are a lot of actors trying too hard to be funny . the strain shows . i watched this with two friends on another friend ' s recommendation- none of us were thrilled .  although i found the acting excellent , and the cinematography beautiful , i was extremely disappointed with the adaptation . 

one of the significant portions of the novella is the fact that ethan and mattie decide to kill themselves , rather than go on . this is never presented in the movie , they show it as if it were a sledding accident . 

the character changes in mattie and zenna are almost non-existent . while in the novella they almost change places , at the end of this adaptation it appears as if they are both invalids . 

lastly that mattie and ethan consummate their relationship fully nearly destroys the power and poignancy of the finale . 

the change of the narrator being a preacher was one effective change . 

neeson and arquette are superb in their portrayals . joan allen was also wonderful , however her character was much watered down from whartons novella . 

i do not expect films to faithfully portray novels , but this one went to far and in the process nearly destroyed the story . 

overall , i would not recommend watching this film unless you have read the book as you will come away confused and disappointed .  i ' ve never been a huge fan of almodovar , but , generally , i ' ve always found something to enjoy in his films . unfortunately , i had more trouble finding something to enjoy in broken embraces then i would normally think i would . 

i find the biggest failure in broken embraces to be the characters and the lack of depth they display . the film is essentially a love story , one that is tragic , and one that wants to involve the viewer in their stories . i found this problematic from the beginning . 

in the opening scene , our ' hero ' the director / screenwriter , mateo , is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met . his agent comes in as the woman bashfully leaves . 

in the opening scene , our ' hero ' the director / screenwriter , mateo , is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met . his agent comes in , and rolls her eyes , as the woman bashfully leaves . mateo babbles something about needing to enjoy life as the only thing he has left . having been blinded in a tragic car accident that also killed his ' true ' love lena , played by penelope cruz , the viewer might buy into to this notion except the rest of the film really never illustrates why lena was the love of his life or any depth to his character or any other . 

cruz plays lena the mistress to an industrialist named ernesto martel . from the outset , their union is rather a pathetic one , as martel clutches jealousy to lena , and lena avoids uncertainty of being on her own by staying with the much older martel . to skip ahead , martel finances a film for mateo so he can keep tabs on the star of the film , lena . naturally , without any back story , lena and mateo fall in love . and , in almodovar ' s world it really is that simple . mateo , in the opening scene , has sex with a sexy young woman , now mateo falls in love with lena , later it ' s revealed he had a son with his agent after their love affair . her son responds to this information with a laugh and an , " oh , well . " again , no depth , no understanding for any of these characters , it all just happens . from the beginning of the film to the end , i got no depth of emotion from mateo . he is flat , and doesn ' t act much different from one scene to the next . 

the one scene i did enjoy was when film producer , martel , is watching video footage his son recorded under the guise of doing a documentary of mateo . there are nice a moment of martel watching obsessively as a lip reading confirms his worst fears . later , lena confronts martel as he ' s watching the footage and speaks her part out loud matching the video footage of her lips as she talks . some quite brilliant moments . rather contrived , but still really fascinating . 

unfortunately , for me , the rest of the film left me rather bored . i couldn ' t care about these characters or their situations , so no amount of cleverness on almodovar ' s part can make up for this lack of depth . i think if you ' re a fan of his work you ' ll enjoy this movie , but if you ' re like me , in between , then you ' ll find it lacking .  wealthy horse ranchers in buenos aires have a long-standing no-trading policy with the crawfords of manhattan , but what happens when the mustachioed latin son falls for a certain crawford with bright eyes , blonde hair , and some perky moves on the dance floor ? 20th century-fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges . it is very heavy on the frenetic , gymnastic-like dancing , exceedingly thin on story . betty grable ( an eleventh hour replacement for alice faye ) gives it a boost , even though she ' s paired with leaden don ameche ( in tan make-up and slick hair ) . also good : charlotte greenwood as betty ' s pithy aunt , a limousine driver who ' s constantly asleep on the job , and carmen miranda playing herself ( who else ? ) . the stock shots of argentina far outclass the action filmed on the fox backlot , and some of the supporting performances are quite awful . by the time of the big horserace finale , most viewers will have had enough . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  it was inferred by a previous poster that the military would not be subordinate to the police in a disaster as depicted in the film . in fact the military role would be to supply aid to the civil authorities when requested to do so . the civil authorities would retain primacy . in practise the army would need 48 hours or so to mobilise themselves , there not being much army presence in london , especially with current overseas commitments . even then they would be dependent on calling in the ta . 

as for cobra , we were given the impression that it was a full governmental emergency department in its own right - even reference to a met police cobra division . in fact cobra stands for cabinet office briefing room " a " . it ' s just the room where the pm or dpm meet their advisers to discuss the current emergency !  the movie is nice well pictured , but no originality . . . 

this movie is directly copied from " the hitch " where salman plays like a date dr . like will smith , and govinda like some fat jerk , who is desperate to get in love with her boss by the end the movie comes to an old indian flimi style , the bride ' s father doesn ' t like the bride ' s lover and gets some other groom , and govinda the bride ' s lover comes in the end and saves her from the new groom and a fancy dance and stuff . 

the comedy was real good , no doubt when the hitch meets hindi would be more funnier . . . . 

ultimately worth a watch but when it comes on tv after few months . . .  like many western pennsylvania history buffs , i had been really looking forward to this much-heralded pbs program that was produced by pittsburgh ' s wqed . however , i must say now that i was somewhat disappointed . on the positive side , i believe that overall this film did a fair job of explaining the main issues and describing the events of the so-called french and indian war . in particular , its presentation of the indians ' point of view was somewhat new and quite interesting , although it certainly was at time over-emphasized . also on the positive side , the blend of narrative and action scenes was well done and came across somewhat better than many of these typical documentaries made up of " experts " interviews and picture stills ( a la ken burns ) . on the negative side , many of the battles did have a somewhat " staged " look and many important aspects of the war were overlooked . most of all i was very disappointed and frustrated by how little importance was given to forbes ' s successful campaign of 1758 against fort duquesne as compared to the earlier failures of 1754 by washington and 1755 by braddock . in particular , i was somewhat incredulous that there was no mention of colonel henry bouquet , the swiss mercenary in the british service who was most responsible for forbes ' success . finally i could not believe the complete omission of the 1763 battle of bushy run that started as a re-run of braddock ' s defeat but ended up as the victory that decided the outcome of pontiac ' s war thanks to the wiles of the same colonel bouquet who certainly must rank as one of the most successful british commanders of this war .  imagine a film the complete opposite of lawrence of arabia , instead of having an all male cast , it has an all female cast . instead of being set in the barren deserts of arabia , it is set in the bulging metropolis of new york city . and instead of it being one of the greatest films ever made , it is one of the most pointless , boring and forgettable . 

the film concerns mary haines ( meg ryan ) a perfect wife and mother , the envy of all others in her high society manhatten social circle . she is painted as a women bearing the weight of the world on her shoulders , despite the fact she needs a live in nanny and housekeeper to cope with her one child . but i don ' t want to be too hard on her , mary does all this whilst taking a liassez-faire attitude towards the fashion designing job her father has given her . this idyllic lifestyle cannot last forever though and things start to crash in a very real way . 

mary ' s husband is cheating on her and her father fires her for not working hard enough . she is quite naturally upset and breaks down a little . 

mary needs to bounce back though , for the sake of her impressionable young daughter and for herself . she does this through rehab , hair straightening and designing her own line of clothes ; though amazingly for this kind of film , not a montage . mary succeeds ; her daughter loves her , her mother loves her , her friends love her and her husband decides he loves her now . she decides to take her cheating husband back after realising it was her fault he cheated , as she didn ' t dote on him enough . 

the films one saving grace is that it doesn ' t go down the " all men are evil " route .  the great yul brynner , who won an ' oscar ' , and who has starred blockbusters such as ' the ten commandments ' among lots of others , ended his remarkable career with cheap backlot movies such as this one , ' sartana ' , and such . regretable , indeed . one should take pity on seeing him making his very best to make this idiotic thing stand . gone were the days when he was surrounded by steve mcqueen , james coburn , charles bronson , eli wallach , in ' the magnificent seven ' , and walked around under the famous elmer bernstein soundtrack . it ' s difficult to make a living out of being an actor , sometimes .  one would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this made-for-tv movie , it would reflect something of the taste and manners of the upper class couple--wallis simpson and the prince of wales--instead of being a mawkish , unappetizing historical romance . 

nor is it helped by the fact that jane seymour and anthony andrews give stiff , rather uncomfortable to watch performances in which the events move much too slowly to hold attention . 

it ' s hard to understand why a star of olivia de havilland ' s caliber would wish to play the supporting role of aunt bessie since the role is so colorless she just about fades out of sight . at this stage in her career , olivia was appearing in so many " nobility " roles requiring a regal presence but nothing more . 

a trivial movie best left forgotten among all the made-for-tv movies of that era .  this film basically try to portray the heroism of firefighters by making the whole movie revolve around a american dad with a good heart that puts others before himself . now i know they try to show jack morrison ( joaquin phoenix ) as a typical american father that is a firefighter but like there is just nothing interesting in about him what so ever , thus when the movie gets to the climax there is just little to no emotion . this movie basically tries to make the life of a firefighter exciting but it just comes off as boring as any other jobs except you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire . john travolta plays the captain of the fire station but anyone could have played his role and he is a dull character as the rest of the film . what could have been a good film is that the firefighter are put way up as heroes because they are firemen and turns the whole scenario into a uninteresting melodrama . 

4 . 9 / 10 this was an 1970s-type irreverent comedy , poking fun at the psychiatric profession and at beverly hills . i didn ' t mind that but i did object to more that irreverence regarding marriage and religion : two topics which secular filmmakers ( meaning about everyone in hollywood and elsewhere ) just can ' t stop trashing . 

walter matthau plays a scuzzy character , " donald becker , " who walks around with a cleric ' s collar on , which offends me but when has hollywood ever been worried about offending christians ? 

anyway , despite that nonsense the film has its entertaining moments and even some charm to it . dan aykroyd is good at paying a nut-case and donna dixon ( " laura rollins " ) is a knockout . i am sorry she didn ' t have a bigger role .  back in 2002 when matthew lawrence did the hot chick , i also saw drumline that day . drumline wins by default ! if the comebcaks had been released in march ( as planned ) the same time tmnt was released , tmnt would ' ve won by default ! 

granted , matthew lawrence did a fine job portraying a quarterback . he didn ' t have to resort to uttering dirty words which is a plus . but when he started playing with his private parts as well as another football players and touching a girl ' s boob , those were the minuses . 

but the biggest minus that ticked me off is that every football player got to participate in the mock music video , except matthew lawrence ( insert the price is right ' s losing horns ) ! another blown musical opportunity for him , just because he ' s shy about doing music . 

in the past , matt has disappointed me many times ( super human samurai syber squad ) where he came so close to having a musical moment , but ended up failing . 

sure , joey had a singing career with two albums to his belt and andrew ' s starting a music career of his own . but it ' s very rare to find a matt musical moment . the two that stand out would be on brotherly love where he played the guitar and sang " pigeon on your car " ( art atrack ) , which he wrote by the way , and that romantic boy meets world moment when he sang " this dame " ( as time goes by ) . 

matt , you ' ve played jocks too long . why not make a musical comeback . you have a good voice and i miss your musical side .  this movie would have been alright , indeed probably excellent , if the directors would have left the interviews and the concert footage separate . " into the void " is a great song , and i hate how it is cut off at the best part to go to an mumbling interview with ozzy osbourne . that should have been at the end of the film , or located in a special feature . the best part of concert dvds is to put them on and let the music play , but " black sabbath : the last supper " is hard to put and and simply let play because the music is continually interrupted . nevertheless , there are a few strengths to this film ; the concert footage , when it does play , it excellent . black sabbath returns to the stage after a long hiatus without osbourne and this film captures that well : sabbath basically rocks the fans . the fans , of course , have a sweet advantage in the film because they are seeing the band live , of course , but also they do not have to put up with the incessant interviews that the dvd viewers are burdened with . shame on jeb brien and monica hardiman ( the directors ) for doing this to the film ! also , shame on wyatt smith for editing the film in such a way .  i have an affection for these twists on british social norms and it is rare that one loses me . but our betters did lose me a bit . it ' s a tale of social climbers and their joy at breaking the rules but personally i found it a little dull . 

i liked the duchess though she whines a little too much and constance bennett amiably fills the role of lady greyston , a role that bette davis could have played backwards . 

but the movie comes the life in the third act when ernest joins the party . he is so lively and fun ( and in truth probably wears more makeup then lady greyston ) . he gets the last line of the film and it ' s a gas !  this movie truly shows the farce and hypocrisy of indian society . what it tries to show you is only one side of the story . the other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of indian children which this movie does not show . 

 " indian parents " are culpable for the following : a . destroying the individuality of the children by making them completely dependent on the parents at a very early age . such children grow up to be adults only in physical looks but remain children in minds . since everything has been provided to them by their great indian parents , they children automatically do not feel the need to work hard at something or learn the basics of human communication with other human beings apart from their parents . 

b . i can show you so many indian parents who try to prevent their kids making friends , going out or prevent them to do anything which starts making them to grow into adults . 

the reason why they do is the same selfishness . indian parents " expect " their children to take care of them when they grow old . they do no savings for themselves and once they reach the age of 50 . . . they cry out loud . . . . . . we have grown old now and so we are dependent on you children since we have done the great service of bringing you to this world and taking care of you and making you intellectually weak . 

most of the indian parents at the age of 50 have dilapidated bodies and health and are financially completely insecure . most feel that they absolutely have no need to take care of themselves since they " expect " their kids to take care of them . 

in the west the opposite of that happens . people start planning at the age of 20 about their retirement and once they retire they are financially secure . 

indian parents do nothing of that sort since like i said they have brought the kids in the world and what better investment at that ? . 

i am a victim of my indian parents ( i am sure there are countless other indian kids like me ) , who have grown up physically but are still struggling with their lives on their own and they continue to have pestering 50 year olds who cry out loud for help all the time . 

this movie shows only one side of the story . . . . . utter piece of junk made with film stock left over from the production of nana , 1927 ' s sur un air de charleston is described as a holiday film for all concerned , and that ' s the best way to view it . jean renoir seems never to have thought enough of it to even edit the footage together . the plot is a simple reversion of racial stereotypes Â in 2028 a black explorer travels to a post-holocaust paris where a white native girl teaches him the charleston ( naturally he assumes she ' s a savage whose dancing is a prelude to her eating him before giving in to the seductive beat of ' white aborigine ' music ) . there are plenty of surreal touches , be it the pet gorilla eating the flowers in catherine hessling ' s hair , the angels the girl telephones ( renoir and producer pierre braunberger among them ) or the fact that black performer johnny huggins plays his part in minstrel blackface while hessling ' s dancing ability is almost completely nonexistent , and there are some interesting occasional experiments with slow motion , but there ' s not really enough to sustain it for two reels . an additional air of surrealism is provided by the fact that this silent musical has absolutely no score at all on lions gate ' s new dvdÂ this noisy , dizzying football film from director oliver stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well , everyone except william h . macy , who could have tackled the role played by mr . stone , the team doctors , or the " fruitcake " selling cereal . if you ' re a fan of the foul-mouthed , there are some great , profanity-laden knock-down , drag-out , put-down phrases you can try-out on two-faced friends and way-ward lovers . the film is sometimes good as lively background party atmosphere , especially during the first two hours ; it even features some mtv-styled music video scenes . 

 * * any given sunday ( 12 / 16 / 99 ) oliver stone ~ al pacino , cameron diaz , jamie foxx , dennis quaid george and mildred is a truly unfunny film . this attempt to translate the successful tv series to the big screen was a dismal failure , as is so often the case . 

the wit and clever one-liners from the tv shows have gone missing . the plot is a typical english farce of confused characters and mistaken identities , which is neither funny enough nor weird enough to provoke many decent laughs . 

die-hard george and mildred fans might want to see this final episode of the pair ' s output ( mildred died of hepatitis before the film was released ) , but others should invest their time more wisely .  barricade finds alice faye without any songs as a refugee trying to flee china and without passport . she ' s in a heap of trouble , i won ' t say what exactly , and even american extraterritoriality won ' t help her out . 

i mention that because one of the grievances that the chinese including the bandits who attack the american mission in this story set deep in the chinese interior was that particular institution whereby american citizens who committed crimes were tried by american courts set up by our consulates . we were far from the only country doing that however . 

anyway the story opens with her on a train for shanghai trying to use a hokey russian accent . the accent intrigues warner baxter who ' s pretty plastered . 

bandits however interrupt the journey and the two of them seek refuge in the american consulate presided over by charles winninger . he ' s the best one in the film and i only wish that a better story was given because i liked his character . he ' s a widower and a proud member of the consular service , appointed in 1900 by william mckinley . he requested a transfer ten years later and that ' s the last he was heard from . as assistant secretary of state jonathan hale aptly put it , he ' s the real forgotten man . 

baxter does all right in a role that someone like clark gable would have done in his sleep at mgm . the heroics would have come more natural to gable than to baxter as the mission is barricaded and defended against the bandits . 

alice faye did have one number to sing . why alice ' s song was cut out , god and zanuck only know . one thing i ' m still trying to figure out is when the mission inhabitants take final refuge in the cellar with a trap door , just who was left upstairs to pull the rug over the cellar door ? 

barricade had the potential to be a lot better than it was . but sloppy editing and lost faith in the project made 20th century fox release a project unfulfilled . watching barricade is like eating a badly cooked meal .  directed by diane keaton and adapted from a book by franz lidz . a young mother selma lidz ( andie macdowell ) is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband sid ( john tururro ) is a little lacking in the emotions department . unhappy with the new home situation , their sensitive son steven ( nathan watt ) decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles danny ( michael richards ) and melvin ( lou cutell ) until his mom is well . steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle ' s living habits ; he even decides he wants to change his name to franz . set in the early 60 ' s , this drama is a bit comedic . . . change that to zany . not being a macdowell fan , unstrung heroes assures my attitude ; albeit i enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste .  what a terrible movie ! it represents perfectly the state of degenerateness of french society , where the most elementary respect for wholesome values and traditions has completely disappeared . the plot is nonsensical , the movie is not funny at all and the characters are completely shallow and uninteresting . to say the least , the direction and the cinematography are very poor and uninspired . catherine deneuve is as bad an actress as she always was , even when she was directed by bunuel in belle de jour . the rest of the usually good cast ( vincent lindon , line renaud , jean yanne ) seem completely lost in an ocean of vulgarity , platitudes and restlessness . i cannot help to draw a parallel with the wonderful james ivory ' s " le divorce " , with its thoughtful depiction of french and american mores , its superlative cinematography and stellar cast put to good use . having watched " le divorce " you can feel a kind of empathy with the french , regardless of their foibles . " belle-maman " leaves you with only a nauseated contempt for its morally bankrupt and clueless protagonists .  adenoid hynkel , a lowly soldier in world war one , rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of toumania . he creates an aggressive , antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush moustache . sound like anyone you know ? 

from the safety of hollywood , chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort europe to take up arms and defy hitler and mussolini . given that the united states in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it , and no strong desire to embroil itself in europe ' s civil strife ( remember , it was hitler who declared war on the usa , not the other way round ) it is surprising that chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic . 

the story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides , and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly , humane , brave , etc . , etc , chaplin is hynkel , and he also plays the jewish barber , the little hero of the ghetto ( the tramp in all but name ) . needless to say , chaplin writes , directs , stars , composes the music and does the catering . 

in 1940 the full truth was not yet known about the third reich , and chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight , but even by the standards of the day he gets hitler badly wrong . a comedian and a sentimentalist , chaplin tries to ridicule hitler by making hynkel silly and hapless . all this does is to humanise him . when hynkel the not-very-warlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside-down aeroplane , he becomes endearing rather than despicable . as dictator , he inspects his subordinates ' technical innovations which don ' t work ( the parachute hat , the bulletproof uniform etc . ) and these passages are meant to make us think that the real-life nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside . in fact , hynkel ' s regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery . 

in truth , chaplin ' s day had already passed when he made this ill-considered polemic . at heart , he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen ( check out the humour , with gags like staggering up and down the street semi-conscious , or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings ) . the hero schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of european decency against which hynkel can be judged , but schultz looks more like a character from operetta than a nazi . is it in any way believable that a schultz figure ( if such had existed ) would say to the fuehrer ' s face , " your cause is doomed to failure because it ' s built upon the stupid , ruthless persecution of innocent people " ? and how does schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto ? if he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt , why does he persist in wearing his ruritanian uniform ? chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of auschwitz-birkenau or treblinka , but the nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age . as usual , chaplin thinks in terms of ' silent ' comedy set-pieces , loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line . there is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers , shaving a man to the accompaniment of brahms , and the globe ballet ( watch for the segment filmed in reverse ) . 

paulette goddard is the unremittingly perfect hannah . just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice , and the jewish haven in osterlich is ridiculously idyllic , so hannah is quite literally too good to be true . brave , defiant , resourceful , hardworking and ( of course ) beautiful , she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage . " gee , ain ' t i cute ? " she asks , after the barber gives her a make-over . too cute by far , is the answer . she doesn ' t come close to ringing true , because chaplin has made her a caricature . the ' wouldn ' t it be wonderful ? ' speech which chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author - too wordy , too emotionally cloying . 

jack oakie is great as napaloni , the fascist dictator of bacteria . he brings a whiff of much-needed comic brio to the proceedings , but the film ' s underlying weakness remains . if napaloni is silly and ineffective , how can we fear him ? and anyway , the stuttering stop-start of the back-projected train is a fine chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth . 

and where did the jewish barber acquire that immaculate hynkel uniform ?  42 / 100 . often referred as " tarzan with clothes on " , but it ' s not at all in the same league as his far superior tarzan series . basically , the jungle jim series became a tarzan replacement for johnny weismuller , after he started getting too out of shape for a loincloth . in jungle jim , he is fully clothed . it can ' t compare to the tarzan series in any way , not in acting , screenplays or quality of production . it ' s pretty hokey stuff . this one is the first the best in the series , and that isn ' t saying much . too much stock footage is used , and it is so obvious . the score is overdone , and the plot is lame and the production is so poor it makes it hard to watch at times .  this has to be one of , if not the greatest mob / crime films of all time . every thing about this movie is great , the acting in this film is of true quality ; master p ' s acting skills make you actually believe he is italian ! the cinematography is excellent too , probably the best ever . this movie was great ; and i have the brain capacity of an earth worm .  possible spoilers as peter jackson has so brilliantly shown in his `lord of the rings ' trilogy , it is quite possible to make good films , even great ones , within the heroic fantasy genre . the genre has distinguished literary antecedents , dating back to the mediaeval chivalric romances , particularly the arthurian legends , upon which tolkien and other authors have drawn . `lord of the rings ' apart , however , it is difficult to think of any other sword-and-sorcery films which are any good . i would agree with the reviewer who said that the best of a bad bunch was ron howard ' s `willow ' , and even that achieved little distinction other than that of being a merely mediocre film as opposed to a positively bad one . `red sonja ' , however , cannot achieve the even more modest distinction of being simply a bad film as opposed to an appalling one . 

as with `willow ' , many of the plot-elements in `red sonja ' are derived from `the lord of the rings ' . an evil ruler seeks to gain control of an artefact with supernatural powers in order to achieve an ambition of world domination , but is thwarted by an assorted group of heroes . the film , set in the hyborian age , a barbaric era in the earth ' s remote past , starts with the villain of the piece , the wicked queen gedren , making unwelcome sexual advances to the heroine sonja . when these are rebuffed , gedren ( not a woman to take no for an answer ) reacts by murdering sonja ' s parents and brother . ( in 1985 it was presumably still considered politically correct not only to make the chief villain a woman but also to make one of the main motives for her villainy frustrated lesbian lust ) . 

gedren ' s next move is to capture the talisman , a sort of fluorescent green soccer ball with magical powers , by slaughtering the whole of the scantily-dressed female priesthood charged with protecting it , just as they are about to destroy it because they feel its powers have become too dangerous . among the dead is sonja ' s sister , her sole surviving relative . sonja herself , however , has not been idle , but has enrolled in a martial arts academy from which she graduates summa cum laude , and sets out to avenge herself . along the way she teams up with kalidor , a heroic wandering swordsman-king resembling tolkien ' s aragorn , prince tarn , the spoilt child-ruler of a kingdom that has fallen to gedren ' s powers , and falkon , tarn ' s loyal servant . the rest of the film is fairly predictable , as sonja and her allies try to overthrow gedren and prevent the destruction of the world threatened by the out-of-control talisman . 

just what is it that makes this film so bad ? well , the acting , for a start . arnold schwarzenegger as kalidor gives the sort of typical wooden , poker-faced performance that became his trademark , at least in the early part of his career , complete with heavy foreign accent . compared with brigitte nielsen as the heroine , however , he looks like laurence olivier . miss nielsen seems to have had even worse language difficulties , delivering every line in the mechanical , toneless voice of someone who has just completed lesson three of a `teach-yourself-english-by-correspondence ' course . one wonders if she was hired for the role just to make arnie look good by comparison . the other characters , while not conducting their own private struggles against the english language , are simply cartoonish caricatures , especially prince tarn who must be one of the most obnoxious screen youngsters ever . 

an even worse fault than the bad acting , however , is the film ' s almost complete lack of imagination . this is a particularly glaring fault in a fantasy film , as films of this genre need to rely on their imaginative power in order to persuade the audience to suspend the natural feelings of disbelief that would be provoked by a fantastic plot . when we watch peter jackson ' s masterpiece we can persuade ourselves , at least for the next three hours , that we are in middle-earth , that elves , wizards and hobbits do exist , and that the fate of the world really does depend upon the destruction of a magic ring . when we watch `red sonja ' we are persuaded of nothing except that we are watching a bunch of actors with bad accents fighting one another on a hillside for possession of a lime-green football . 

this lack of imagination even starts with the film ' s title . the british science-fiction author brian aldiss , when challenged about the exotic names given to his characters , replied that there was little point in creating a fictional alien society with its own distinctive culture if you were going to spoil the effect by calling the hero joe . ( admittedly , tolkien was able

to get away with giving the name sam to one of his main characters , but that was because hobbits were supposed to be reassuringly familiar , the middle-earth equivalent of tweedy , pipe-smoking englishmen ) . similarly , giving the heroine of a tale ostensibly set in a long-gone barbaric age a common girls ' name like `sonia ' ( which is how the name `sonja ' is pronounced ) is about as appropriate as calling her `betty ' or `mary-jane ' . 

the film seems to have been made on a very small budget , which makes me wonder why they bothered at all . fantasy needs to be done convincingly , or not at all . it was obviously shot in a remote mountain area , with little or no attempt to suggest a distinctive culture . the few buildings we see , such as the temple of the talisman or gedren ' s palace , are obviously cheap sets . we learn that tarn ' s capital city has been destroyed by gedren using the power of the talisman , but we do not actually see this event ; all we see is what might be a thunderstorm taking place on the other side of a hill . at first you wonder how sonja intends to overthrow an entire kingdom with only a few allies , but when you see how small an army gedren has at her disposal it becomes more understandable . when an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace , you wonder if this is the talisman at work or merely a crew member inadvertently leaning against the set . if we can enjoy this film for nothing else , we can at least enjoy it for its inadvertent humour ; a fine example of the so-bad-it ' s-funny school of filmmaking . ed wood would have been proud of this one . if it had been shown on californian television the night before the recall election , gray davis would still be governor . 2 / 10 .  the obsession of ' signifie ' and ' signifiant ' is not enough to make a good film . pascal bonitzer should have remained in our memory as a brilliant film theorist back in the ' 60Â´s . it was not necessary to take the camera . the result is quite frustrating . itÂ´s a pity for his excellent leading actors .  released at a time when duvivier was going again from strength to strength . " black jack " which was sandwiched between the overlooked extraordinary " au royaume des cieux " and the dazzling stunning " sous le ciel de paris " , is a jumble , which duvivier himself hated , which is not surprising . there ' s almost nothing to write about this dud . we can notice that : 

1 . orson welles used to admire duvivier . that may explain why wellesian actors were featured in duvivier ' s movies : joseph cotten in " lydia " ( 1941 ) , and here a totally wasted agnes moorehead . it ' s the first time

i have not enjoyed moorehead ' s performance ! on the other hand , welles borrowed his desdemona ( suzanne cloutier ) from duvivier ' s " au royaume des cieux " for his " othello " . 

2 . in any duvivier ' s movie , there ' s one or two worthwhile sequences and this one is no exception : the search in the caves where duvivier ' s sense of mystery works wonders ( for a short while ) ; then the chase when dalio gets caught up in the fishnets . duvivier ' s touch can be felt in the unhappy end too . 

as for the rest , as my dear pen pal writer ' s reign writes , it ' s a black joke .  the most fertile man in ireland revolves around eamon manley who is 24 year old and still happens to be a virgin . he lives with his mother in belfast . he is also a very shy guy towards women . everything has changes for eamon when he is seduced by a woman ( as far as i can remember a neighbour ) . it is not because he looses his virginity but he discovers that he has a super power . despite having protection , this neighbour becomes pregnant . he is told by the doctor that he has very high sperm count . his mother brilliantly comes up with an idea which makes us see ginger headed babies all around in the end of the film . he starts helping out women in both side of belfast to conceive babies . first voluntarily then with the help of his colleague runs a business out of it . the most fertile man in ireland has its funny moments but needed to come up with better jokes and with a better script . i couldn ' t help thinking that it gave me the impression of a tv sitcom rather than a movie . kris marshall is a different name on the silver screen but does not shine as star . it ' s more like the guy you saw in such and such movie . like him being in love actually ( i think he was very funny in that one ) . . well , it was okay to watch but couldn ' t help dozing off from time to time . * * out of * * * * *  you may like tim burton ' s fantasies , but not in a commercial-like show off lasting 8 minutes . it demonstrates good technical points without real creativity or some established narrative pace .  slaughter trail is a b western with some grand pretensions . but it ' s come down in hollywood history for a most ignominious reason . 

watching this film with it ' s musical score which can only be described as overbearing , i have a feeling what howard hughes was trying to do is recruit a singing cowboy for rko films . they already had tim holt who was as reliable a b picture cowboy hero there ever was , but he was not a singer . i guess hughes saw what money herbert j . yates was raking in with roy rogers over at republic and decided he ' d get one as well . 

so terry gilkyson who was a very good performer and much better song writer got recruited and sang some of his material which was not his best and worse , looked like they were shoehorned into the picture . but worse than that , there ' s this annoying chorus which sang a lot of the story and frankly overwhelmed the actors , extras , even the horses . needless to say terry never got to be a singing cowboy . but he did write such classics as the bare necessities and dean martin ' s great hit , memories are made of this . 

the plot concerns an inside woman on a stagecoach jewel robbery . that ' s right , the outlaws who are gig young , myron healey , and ken koutnik plant virginia grey in the coach as a passenger which they receive word is carrying some valuable jewels . 

it ' s a great act grey and young pull off . young takes her away from the coach to presumably a fate worse than death and they do properly act out the scene within earshot of the passengers , but what he does is slip her the swag . last place the authorities might look , if she doesn ' t run off with it . 

but when they flee the robbery it ' s on tired horses so they stop at a cabin to take some replacement mounts and shoot three navajos who object . that puts the navajos back on the warpath , didn ' t help that one of the casualties was chief ric roman ' s brother . 

that ' s the situation that captain brian donlevy at the fort has to deal with when the coach and the outlaws arrive there for protection . how it all works out is predictable , but in a gaudy sort of overproduced way . 

in fact that ' s the problem with slaughter trail . it ' s a simple no frills b western that got souped up into something almost grotesque . 

but the real reason slaughter trail entered into history is that this film apparently marks the official beginning of the blacklist . originally howard dasilva was to play donlevy ' s part and may have in fact completed his scenes , when howard hughes officially fired him for communist sympathies . his scenes were completely re-shot with brian donlevy in the lead . 

considering what a fiasco this film turned into , i ' m not sure whether donlevy or dasilva ought to have thanked hughes or kicked him in his private preserve .  i appeared as an extra and was on location as a journalist covering " the dain curse " . my involvement was during the segments of this film shot in jim thorpe , pa . ( jim thorpe was also one of the locations of the 1969 film " the molly maguires " ) . i reported the ' action ' in the emmaus free press newspaper where i was editor 1978-80 ( the paper ceased publication int he 1990s ) . i recall the excellent attention to detail of the period costumes , automobiles , etc . the modern asphalted streets of jim thorpe were covered with gravel to mimic a 1920s rural town of the south . at the time , i interviewed the producer and spoke briefly with the director during a set change break ; i did not get to interview james coburn which was always a great disappointment to me . as an aside , i appear briefly in one of the street scenes wearing a snap- brim hat and a tweed jacket . the producer asked me to " jump in " and it was a real thrill . i still have a collection of black and white stills i took of the production work for the newspaper . someday , they may be of interest to film / television historians . --lou varricchio the disney studios ' remake of their own 1965 slapstick classic concerns a clever feline leading an f . b . i . agent to a kidnapped woman . christina ricci gives a churlish , let-me-outta-here performance as the cat ' s owner and the fed is played by doug e . doug , embarrassingly over-the-top , like a human cartoon . a pair of rich neurotics ( dyan cannon and original " cat " cast member dean jones ) are funny and the formula-plot still has a little juice left in it , but the handling here is so heavy and lugubrious , and the cat is so lifeless , that it ' s strictly d . o . a . 

 * from * * * *  i was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine . the gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me , and i could see why people would have been afraid of someone like dillinger . seeing it as an adult , it seemed almost comical , owing to the overdone narration and jarring details like thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the fifties . there is a certain gritty , unglamorous reality to the way the criminals are portrayed , but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera . the most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where ma barker and her sons are shooting it out with the fbi and the sons are killed . the narrator says something like " perhaps in that moment , for the only time in her life , ma barker became a real mother " . this is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos , as ma finally realizes how she ' s destroyed her family out of her own greed , but instead , it provokes laughter . a very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days . gangster movie buffs might enjoy it , but more as a curiosity than a real movie .  the title of this documentary is very misleading . at no time during the documentary do they show how the introduction of the nile perch fish into lake victoria has cause any of the problems facing the town of mwanza , tanzania . the film tries to place the problems of tanzania on an environmental cause but the truth of that matter is the problems stem from a parasitic outside force . the documentary is very slowing paced with no narrative what so ever . instead it relies on small blips of text between none related segments to display bits of information that do little to add or expand of the subject matter . there are only two attempts to discus the environmental effects of the nile perch fish . one is a small segment about 10 seconds long where they interview the factory managers where the fish is processed and he briefly mentions how 50 years ago the nile perch was introduced into the lake and it consumed the other fish species . the film maker makes no attempt to follow up on the matter or go deeper into it . the second attempt is when within this documentary they film the showing of another documentary that is discussing the environmental impact the nile perch has introduced , and again no real attempt is made to expand on just how devastating the problem has become . 

the subject matter that this documentary does delve into has nothing to do with the perch fish itself and more to do with the problems facing most african countries . the film tries to link the introduction of the perch fish with aids , poverty and pollution in tanzania but never makes a direct connection . as any intelligent person well read with problems in africa , the problems shown here are not unique to tanzania but affect most of africa and have nothing to do with the fish . it would have been great if the film makers would have shown how the local economy or life was before the fish was introduced and how it has been negatively impacted by the introduction of the fish but they don ' t . the fact of the matter is that many of the people they interview say that the fish has provided jobs and opportunity for many . yes things are bad within the town of mwanza but they are far worst in other parts of the country and continent for that matter . 

a weak attempt by the documentary makers to link the fish to famine problems in tanzania is quickly discredited by the documentary itself . first off tanzania is a very large country and lake victoria is only a small portion of the country . many of the individuals interview actually say that they can to mwanza , the fishing town on the lake , to find a job and feed their families because things were so bad in other parts of the country . 

this documentary is very weak , has no narrative and makes no attempt to actually link anything they display to the nile perch . it plays on people ' s emotions by displaying images of the devastation of poverty , famine and aids making no attempt to show you how any of this is unique to the lake victoria region of tanzania or directly related to the perch fish . the fact is most of the problems have more to do with war , globalization and christianity than and environmental effect of the perch fish itself .  based on the 2007 spy novel by david ignatius , body of lies tells the story of a cia operative roger ferris ( dicaprio ) who is sent to jordan to track down an al-qaeda mastermind , all the while treading a narrow tightrope of loyalty to his jordanian hosts and his manipulative american boss ed hoffman ( crowe ) . 

anybody who ' s seen the trailers could be forgiven for thinking the story revolves around double-agent action and the betrayal of ferris by hoffman , but the actual story is much more mundane . instead we are served a tepid broth of ridiculous subterfuge as white pretty boy american ferris moves with virtual impunity through the teeming streets of amman jordan with nary a worried look over his shoulder or the attraction of attention from the locals . only during a scene where ferris takes his new-found iranian sweetheart out for tea does reality intrude as the couple are bombarded with glares from jordanian men . 

compounding the film ' s problems are plot twists and turns which seem designed as nothing more than padding . ferris flies to jordan , ferris gets expelled from jordan , ferris flies to washington , ferris flies to the uk , ferris flies back to jordan , hoffman flies to jordan , hoffman returns home to take care of his kids Â an on it goes . this is the sort of stuff you expect to see in an episode of the amazing race , not a spy thriller . 

in body-punishing loyalty to his craft , crowe gained an impressive 63 pounds of flab for the role of portly ed hoffman , thus joining the small select club of actors consisting of robert de niro and christian bale as thespians who ' ve subjected themselves to massive weight gain or loss for their roles . it ' s too bad that everyone else involved didn ' t share crowe ' s level of dedication to quality , for if they did , we ' d have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess .   " tart " is a good illustration of old the yogi berra saying : " if you don ' t know where you are going , you will probably end up someplace else " . writer / director christina waye ( in her first feature ) has managed to make a $ 3 million movie that ends up someplace else . " tart " is either a coming of age story devoid of characters that a rational person can connect with , a black comedy without any humor , or a sexploitation movie without anything that is particularly sexy . 

unlike the standard swain film , " tart " actually employed a competent and experienced production designer . good enough to provide two extremely nice shots : the scene of swain and barton taking a bubble bath together and the scene of swain in the park-featuring a nice montage of the " alice in wonderland " sculpture . the symbolism incorporated into these elements supports the possibility that waye ( despite the absence of a linear logic or unity of tone ) actually has some visionary talent and aspirations for making a quality film . 

it is even possible that waye was trying for a fusion of the somewhat expressionistic " metropolitan " and the camp classic " cruel intentions " which also deal with the manhattan upper class . there are many camera shots framed by windows and doors yet few tight shots of faces and eyes . the former technique hinting at symbolism and the latter at intentional distancing from the characters and their motivations . " tart " seemed on the verge of veering into camp territory at least twice and would have been well advised to keep going in that direction . first there was the scene where they try to dump the seemingly deceased swain into the garbage chute . then there is the whole bit about her father being jewish ( played to the same extreme as joel grey dancing with the jewish guerrilla in " cabaret " ) . 

in her other films swain ' s acting technique is to overwhelm each scene in which she appears ( insert scenery chewing here ) but in " tart " she actually shows an ability to restrain herself . this is the best performance of her career . it also provides some clues about her physical deterioration from willowy super cute in " girl " to hulking lumpy-faced in " pumpkin " . this transformation was about half-complete by the time she made " tart " ; so go the ravages of time . 

mischa barton ( " sixth sense ' s " i feel better girl ) and lacey chabet are excellent in supporting roles . the rest of the cast is simply horrible , although some of the blame for this should go to waye ' s script and direction .  purportedly this is the final film of the left behind series which is fundamentalist preacher and novelist tim lahaye ' s idea of what we can expect in our future in the final days of planet earth . if this is the case we can expect an activist presidency in every sense of the word if barack obama becomes president next year . 

the fantastic four of revelation are all back with one cast change , arnold pinnock who most would know as the guidance counselor in life with derek , is now the minister taking the place of clarence gilyard . brad johnson as the anti-christ ' s pilot by day and christian by night is there as his daughter janaya stephens and ace investigative reporter kirk cameron . these are the only four people on earth who have divined the true nature of un secretary general nicolai karpathy and once again are throwing sand in his machinery . 

this time they ' ve got as an ally the president of the united states who is played by louis gossett , jr . he ' s having one hell of a rough time , especially the guerrillas launch on rpg attack on a presidential motorcade killing vice president charles martin smith . that ' s right , the toad is vice president . somebody really messed up bad here because everyone including those who would do them harm know a president and vice president never travel together . 

it takes all of them the entire film to convince gossett exactly who karpathy really is . once again the best one in the film is gordon currie as karpathy . 

we may yet see another left behind film yet , the door was left open though people assure me that they ' ve run out of source material from tim lehaye . i suppose as long as they make money and these players can ' t get jobs in the mainstream film industry . and there are some unresolved plot issues involving brad johnson and chelsea noble who is mrs . kirk cameron in real life . 

one of the fantastic four does die in this film , so will it be the fantastic three or will they get another fourth . stay tuned .  the man with the golden arm ( the movie ) is a decent career vehicle for frank sinatra , but fails abysmally as a good adaptation of a fantastic book . you always hear about how books are " changed " when they are made into films- things are cut out , dumbed down , etc . well , you can ' t even say they " changed " anything with the movie- they just told a completely different story . the characters and setting are the same sure- but not the ambiguous characterization , the depth of the men and women of polish chicago in the book . as for the setting , it ' s become merely a play stage , complete with the unnecessary " supporting role " players walking all too busilly down the claustrophobic , interior exterior streets . the movie is a dumbed-down , completely different take on frankie machine and drug addiction . when this happens , zosh , frankie , sparrow , all lose their psychological edge . frankie ' s drumming , a modest dream in the book , becomes his full passion in the movie ( probably because sinatra is a musician ) . and drug addiction is treated as shlock , exploitavely . the acting is decent , especially the snakelike louie , who is more menacing in the movie than the book . but it ' s just a shame this kind of movie can be heralded as a classic alongside the book it is " based upon , " the real story of frankie machine . the movie just goes to show hollywood can ' get anything right without dumbing it down and adding a happy ending . in this case , they just changed it completely , cheapening an important and realistic story into hollywood fluff . i ' m sure as hell biased because i read the book first , so i can ' t really treat the movie honestly by knowing how good the book is . i actually thought about turning the movie off ( and i never do that ) , just so i wouldn ' t get its silly plot confused with the beauty of the book . but this is an overrated film , and while it ' s not so bad , the book should come first , as it was the first . and it should have remained the only story of division street and frankie machine .  david bryce ' s comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative as almost say everything i feel about darling lili . this massive musical is so peculiar and over blown , over produced and must have caused ruptures at paramount in 1970 . it cost 22 million dollars ! that is simply irresponsible . darling lili must have been greenlit from a board meeting that said " hey we got that pink panther guy and that sound of music gal . . . lets get this too " and handed over a blank cheque . the result is a hybrid of gigi , zeppelin , half a sixpence , some mgm 40s song and dance numbers of a style ( daisies and boaters ! ) so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical porridge , and mata hari dramatics . the production is colossal , lush , breathtaking to view , but the rest : the ridiculous romance , julie looking befuddled , hudson already dead , the mistimed comedy , and the astoundingly boring songs deaden this spectacular film into being irritating . lili is like a twee 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up . star ! released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally appreciated for the excellent film is genuinely is . . . and andrews looks sublime , mature , especially in the last half hour . . . . . . but lili is poppins and dolly frilly and i believe really killed off the mega musical binge of the 60s . . . . . and made andrews look like poppins again . . . which i believe was not edwards intention . paramount must have collectively fainted when they saw this : and with another $ 20 million festering in catch 22 , and $ 12 million in on a clear day and $ 25 million in paint your wagon . . . . they had a financial abyss of cleopatra proportions with $ 77 million tied into 4 films with very uncertain futures . maybe they should have asked seer daisy gamble from on a clear day . . . . . . lili was very popular on immediate first release in australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for months but it failed once out in the subs and the sticks and only ever surfaced after that on one night stands with on a clear day as a sunday night double . thank god paramount had their simple $ 1million ( yes , one million dollar ) film love story and that $ 4 million dollar gangster pic the godfather also ready to recover all the $ 77 million in just the next two years . . . . for just $ 5m . . . . incredible !  joan crawford is convincingly disfigured as our story starts , and of course she get fixed up . but she ' s a bad egg , exploiting one guy , while living out another guy ' s anti-social philosophy . all of this takes place in sweden , which is truly bizarre . it causes anything and everything memorable in the visuals , which are freed from having to depict anytown usa , but it makes a viewer wonder why every remake since is burdened and rendered unspecific by the need to americanize everything . there is plot , plot , plot so chatty that you could drown in it , and making matters worse is a framing device that adds zilch to the movie . the photography is occasionally nice , with odd angles and miniatures incorporated quite well . but it ' s overwrought without ever once drawing you in .  the movie opens with beautiful landscape shots of the northwest countryside . fenceposts jutting out from soddy earth , a freight train crossing fields of hay in the distance , billows of clouds , small structures by the side of the road , a motel or a diner in the middle of nowhere . over this plays a languid but mysterious twin peaks piano arrangement and it ' s all adequately moody and atmospheric in an american gothic sort of way . through this however director jon jost keeps interleaving awkward frames , blocks of letters , opening credits with annoying swooshing sounds , color frames that announce " blue " , numbers that count towards the " 12 steps to a conclusion " announced in the opening credits . it ' s obvious by the first couple of minutes that , though jost is more than capable to capture landscape and ambiance , he doesn ' t care for it . he has neither the affection for pacific northwest open expanses that terrence malick does in badlands and neither the time or inclination of twin peaks david lynch to weave mystery and intrigue around a given location . 

the rest of the movie is more jon jost frustration with experimental tricks that serve their own purpose . the use of split screen is interesting , i like in particular how we get the first image of ricky lee split in two , one is recounting childhood memories that matter only to him , the other is cursing and banging his head against the wall , and over the course of the movie the second ricky lee prevails , the macho laid-back hipster with the shades who is hopelessly self-involved and stupid . on the other hand the stop motion animation and choice to play most of the movie in voice-over narration does not work . it does at times because jost writes as good as he shoots static shots of the smalltown american nowheresville but beth ann ' s monologues , delivered in the most flat nasal monotone imaginable , a voice that sounds like stephen hawking ' s computer speech program crossed with a horse whinnying , are so grating to the ear it kind of defeats the purpose of trying to pay attention . 

each of the couple relate to us their past experiences , their small triumphs and follies and doubts and past relationships that went nowhere . they say very little to each other and what they say they say with blank faces . but they hump like rabbits . that seems to be their only channel of communication left open , perhaps the only one they can trust with any safety . jost clearly picks his main characters in frameup among the naive and delusional , those baited by an american dream turned sour , but he doesn ' t place himself above them . he ' s not condescending or smug in his portrayal . they may be misguided but they are graced with moments of humanity , awkward though they may be . we ' re called to empathize and show affection rather than point and laugh . this is the most successful frameup becomes ; the movie ' s characters come alive even when their expressionless faces do not , even when jost gets in their way with his stilted framing and obtrusive camera games . 

then we go back to angry rants about the destructive effects of money played over an inserted shot of a dollar bill , we get a weird psychedelic sequence where jost ' s camera glides under big leafy trees that soon turn beetroot red as beth ann repeatedly muses about the " redwood trees " in the voice-over , we even get a sudden about-turn towards plot and genre as the couple of beth ann and ricky lee , smalltown losers with nowhere to go and nothing to hold them back to their dead end lives , arrive in california and decide to rob a 7 / 11 . the movie doesn ' t soar to an emotional crescendo in the aftermath of the botched 7 / 11 job such as one might expect from a ' couple-on-the-run ' road movie , it slowly screeches to a halt and you look out the window to see it hasn ' t really got anyplace in particular . parts of the ride have been hypnotic and parts almost touching and funny , but everything else has been mostly annoying .  butter battle is an entertaining story about two fictional cities and their arms race . it is also as misguided allegory about the cold-war and arms races in general . yes , it is a children ' s book , but like so many of theodor seuss geisel ' s works it hits people over the head with its moral . 

and that moral is what , exactly ? sure it is laudable to encourage us to concentrate more on what unites us than what divides us . it is even a good thing to encourage international cooperation . but to equate the differences between the warsaw pact nations and the nato west to a difference in butter application is just plain wrong . to point out the obvious , many warsaw pact nations enjoyed intermittent periods of shortages of butter and bread -- they would have been happy to eat it butter sideways if it were available . on a less literal level , and whatever your political inclination , soviet socialism versus western ( particularly anglo-american ) democracy is not a mere question of preference and custom . 

to make the point even clearer , nuclear weapons were not developed in a cold war with the soviets , but in a hot war with the axis powers . there is no doubt that germany was developing nuclear capability during the war . should the us have refrained from nuclear weapons research putting their trust in their ( less than inevitable ) victory in the conventional war ? once the weapons were developed they were used against the enemy who attacked us at pearl harbor . what does a nation do at this point when the genie is out of the bottle ? furthermore , hindsight is 20-20 , which is to say that there was no way of assuring another half crazed dictator wouldn ' t crop up with his eyes on developing nuclear weapons . the second gulf war has shown the incredible difficulty in ascertaining credible threats and neutralizing them . 

in any event , the cartoon is little more than simplistic propaganda which does little to explore the nuances of the ethical questions behind nuclear armament and instead tries to inculcate fear of weapons technology into children .  there are interesting pieces here of and about bruce weber ' s likes and dislikes . maybe if a professional editor had put it together for biography , i would have felt more satisfied . instead , i spent $ 8 at a film festival on it . for an autobiography , almost nothing is revealed about bruce weber , other than he likes to look at photographs , shoot interesting people , especially beautiful teenage boys , and listen to jazz . the director of " crumb " would have made a much more interesting and cohesive film .   " yesterday " as a movie , is hard to rate . the cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9 / 10 . the story is gritty and real and does not compromise . but the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not match the camera work . 

as a person who was born and raised in central africa , i appreciated the authenticity of the film ' s look and the honest depiction of daily life for the zulu . but this and the camera work are not enough to recommend the average viewer should see this film . it takes an appreciation of true cinema and not just a love of movies to see the purpose and strength of " yesterday " . 

unlike the 1980 film " the gods must be crazy " , which was a comic look at one african culture encountering modern technology , " yesterday " has no intention of appealing to any crossover audience . the movie simply is not fit for the common western mind - and i doubt it was intended for the western mind . the scenes are long and slow , the editing is not paced for a 60mph+ instant gratification world . the dialog is not cleaver or witty , it is real . movies about health crises do not make the best entertainment and this movie is not entertainment , it is education . 

this movie is best viewed by those who know , appreciate and love the way of life and the culture in sub-sarah africa . if you lack a broad enough world-view to understand other cultures , especially african cultures , should skip this film . do not waste you time with it . go see " talladega nights " or " larry the cable guy " instead for your cross culture viewing . 

i give it a 4 for most who might want to see the movie but have no accurate understanding of african cultures . for the viewers with an appreciation for films about the human experience anywhere in the world , i would give it a 7 .  this lame harold lloyd sound film has nary a laugh in it , and makes one wonder if this lloyd is even the same one that made all of those delightful and hilarious silents . 

lloyd ' s boyish likability becomes fey and limp when we can hear him talk , and a sluggish , restrained pace replaces the zany antics of his silents . lloyd plays a young son of a missionary who grows up in china and then finds himself transplanted to contemporary new york city without a clue as to how life outside his chinese village works . he finds himself an unlikely victor in a mayoral election and quickly draws the ire of all the government organizations because he refuses to look the other way in the face of rampant corruption . when he ' s framed in an attempt to bring him down , he decides to play just as dirty as everyone else , and stages a fake execution of every crook in nyc as a scare tactic . this darkly satiric ending feels out of place next to everything else in the movie , but it ' s the only part of the film that comes remotely to life . everything else is a dull bore . 

i don ' t like having to admit that a harold lloyd movie fails , because i like him so much , but i don ' t have a choice with this one . 

grade : d i really liked this quirky movie . the characters are not the bland beautiful people that show up in so many movies and on tv . it has a realistic edge , with a captivating story line . the main title sequence alone makes this movie fun to watch .  i feel conflicted about this film - it is one of the most beautiful films i ' ve seen , and provides insightful looks into a lost culture . there was an early scene of men in caps and moustaches sitting around a table , with a woman serving , and an accordion playing , that brought tears to my eyes , just because of the way it captured a way of life that must be incomprehensible to many today . it presents the lives of the characters as being inextricably bound up with the life of the village , another lost concept in today ' s world . symbolism is always fun but it seemed a little dated . the fatal flaws of the movie to me were the lack of any compelling dramatic drive , and a total lack of humor . i never felt like i knew any of the characters beyond very basic universal things like grieving over the loss of a loved one , etc . the people were stick figures in the director ' s tableaux involving natural disasters , war , etc . the film was just one beautiful tragic scene after another , with no involving narrative thread and no humanity . as a result , it seemed very abstract , irrelevant to the lives of real people . in the end , i was too bored to finish watching it .  recap : a lone swordsman , living in the desert and acting as an agent to other swordsmen , recollects how his life turned out to be as it is . it started with that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother instead , causing him to leave his home town . one of the swordsmen is huang who is himself in the middle of a complicated love story , where a woman wants to have him killed for having ran away from a promise to marry her younger sister . but the sister wants to hire a swordsman to have huang protected , and everything is put to an edge when the woman and her sister is really the same person . 

comments : i ' ve seen the redux version released in 2008 of the original that was released in 1994 . how the two versions differ i can ' t say , but the redux is very heavily stylized in the way of chinese wuxia action . that is unfortunate as that style to me seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie . a comprehensible story . but true to its style scenery and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus of writer and director kar wai wong . therefore there are lots of colorful , very beautiful scenes , that are completely unrelated to the story . 

the editing and timeline of the story is also mishandled . much is left out in the scenes , the time line is broken and rearranged in a confusing way . very slow and calm scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights , only to themselves being relieved by something else and unrelated . the result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie . 

thanks to these brutal but very few fights , the movie is put into the action genre . the poster and photographs also imply this but could almost be regarded as false marketing . only a few minutes out of the 90 could be considered as anything like action , the other couldn ' t be farther away from it . the movie in its entirety is very slow , dull and hence very boring . not even the rare action filled scenes help since they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie . 

i might say that i ' m not a fan of this chinese style , since they often seem to be afflicted of these same problems , most importantly that the visual is more important than the story , but ashes of time redux is perhaps the worst example i ' ve seen . 

3 / 10 as someone who has read all of baroness orczy ' s books and seen most of the movies based on them , i must say that the 1980 ' s version , with anthony andrews and jane seymour , was better than this . it was better written and stuck more to the spirit of the story than this one , which seemed to go out of its way to involve people getting shot . this new adaptation is less light-hearted , yet does not have as much depth , either . although there is some good acting , the actors did not have much to work with . nice costumes , though .  altman ' s quintet has to be considered more than just flawed : as so many other reviewers have pointed out , the ideas behind the film , even some of the choices in depicting those ideas , ought to work--and yet very little in this difficult film does . the partially fogged camera lens--i remarked to my wife that it has to be the most distracting directorial conceit i ' ve ever seen--never allowed me to get " into " the film ' s world . 

in general there are serious problems with the mise-en-scene employed here . it ' s clear that no small amount of thought went into factors like costume and production design , but neither is very effective in evoking a believable world . perhaps it is a matter of scale ; the film is so stage-bound that i laughed out loud once it was mentioned that " five million " people lived in the city . ( yes i understand the constraints of the film ' s budget . matte paintings here and there might have helped . ) in all the most disappointing altman film i ' ve ever seen . great ideas and grand metaphors do not always come through in art--it ' s just part of the game .  harrison ford playing a playing a cop in a crime thriller . the perfect ingredients it seems for top entertainment with harrison back to his indy and han solo best , protecting a witness from ruthless and merciless murderers . how easy it is to be fooled . if the film concentrated on the main , supposed , themes of crime and suspense instead of putting up barns and shoving ice creams in peoples faces it possibly could have been more worthwhile . unbelieveably predictable with the best method of despatching of a foe is with corn .  i don ' t really know why so many persons love this movie : maybe it ' s funny , ok , but it has totally ruined one of the best novels ever written . as the author himself said , this movie has betrayed the book : not only the story is violently cut to about 1 / 3 , but all the symbols , all the complexity , everything is lost in a very 80 ' s-fashioned fantasy / adventure film for kids . today we have effects , directors , a new attention to books : i hope that someone ( tim burton , peter jackson , hayao miyazaki . . . ) someday will direct the real neverending story . a great dead writer , a wonderful book and many literature lovers deserve it .  lots of flames , thousands of extras in battle scenes , lots of beautiful sets . i don ' t think the plot supported such a vast expenditure . the story could have been told far more effectively and have been more valid , psychologically if there weren ' t so much macho bombast in the production . chinese movies tend to be this way , in my experience . and i think this detracts from the film .  i tried to love this movie . i really did . kevin bacon plays a cerebral palsy victim who is befriended by a 10-year-old girl whose fantasies of digging to china , flying away in a balloon , and so on , are her way of coping with a dreary existence . i admit i did fast-forward through one of the scenes in which the two of them share friendship and simple pleasures while soulful piano music plays in the background . okay , three or four of those type scenes . maybe nine or ten . okay , okay , it was fourteen . but i did sit and watch most of them .  i saw " mirrormask " last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience . 

it is a film that is visually rich but with slow direction , poor plot line and 2-dimensional characterisation . 

i did , however , know this when i went in . i was willing to trust the two gentleman that i went with ( knowledgable comic buffs ) that the visuals would be out of the ordinary and so they were . unfortunately , inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict . though , this is a comment that could be made of many artists whose work is transferred to screen and who are given charge of direction . the pace of the story is lost as the camera lovingly dwells on the pretty pictures . 

i would not have gone at all without that reassurance that the style of the film would be worth seeing . i have tried with neil gaiman ' s work but am always left with the " emperor ' s new clothes " feeling . i live in hope but last night was no exception . 

i do not think i can continue with an analysis of gaiman ' s work without losing the will to live . read the rest of the comments and all his faults are eloquently described . i cannot comprehend , however , how he imagined that he had any understanding of the mind of a fifteen year old girl , nor that what he had to say added anything to the sum total of human knowledge on growing up and assuming adult responsibility , or the changing relationship that a girl might have with her mother . these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly , stereotypically and with no depth of imagination . all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core .  the artist daniel king ( chris john ) and his mate laura peters ( lara clancy ) are invited to move to an old house in cornwall , in great britain , by his childhood wealthy friend natasha carlton ( carol kentish ) . natasha has a crush on daniel , who is an ambiguous man regarding his sentimental life . while alone in the house , weird things happen and laura is startled and scared . when laura meets the old insane priest gabriel norton ( brian blessed ) on the road , she is advised to immediately leave the house , since evil lived there . but the couple stays and has to face tragic consequences . 

what a messy screenplay and awful and cheesy movie this " devil ' s harvest " is ! the cinematography and the camera work is not totally bad , but the amateurish performances of chris john and carol kentish and direction of james shanks , together with the terrible story , ridiculous situations and dialogs make this movie one of the worse i have ever seen in the genre . i have occasionally seen in youtube a couple of shorts from cinema college that are better and better than the pointless and dreadful " devil ' s harvest " . in the end , it is not a horror movie but a horror of movie . my vote is three . 

title ( brazil ) : " a colheita do diabo " ( " the devil ' s harvest " )  is there a fire fighter clichÃ© that is not used in this film ? from the opening line " i ' m getting too old for this " through the " antics " of the firemen , to the " worrisome wife " the loss of his best friend in the firehouse , to the final funeral for the fallen brethren , this film looks and sounds like it was written by the marketing department at disney ( " our studies show that audiences really like it when . . . " and then they stuck it in ) . 

there is nothing original here . any emotion we feel for these guys is brought in for our admiration and feelings for firemen . 

go watch rescue me if you want to see real heroes : everyday guys with flaws that think nothing of running into a burning building to save strangers .  the film was disappointing . i saw it on broadway with bernadette peters and she was outstanding . maybe as she , herself graps on to the end of her musical career , her condtion of desperatation lands her in role that she flaunts , re-invents and triumps as her own . bette ' s singing is always belted , always flat and lacking to show her ability as an actress . to be entertaining , this performance was dying for a stronger lead and a stronger cast , so that the others would be memorable in bette ' s absence . another criticism : she smiles directly into the camera every time she start singing ! i know it is musical theater , but please leave some grace sociale-- middler cannot perform like liza or streisand might in a retrospective tour - out of character and out of context .  my parents may enjoy this show , but i fail to find the humor in it . what is so funny about a dentist husband impregnating his hygienist assistant and the oldest daughter getting impregnated by the captain of the high school football team ? absolutely nothing ! it ' s a shock to me sometimes what people think constitutes humor nowadays . blame that on shows like " the dating game " and " the newlywed game " bringing the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid-1960s . sure , the series has its touching moments , still that ' s no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series . this is nothing like the family-oriented days of " i love lucy " some five decades before . 

an answer i would have to why this series plays on the lifetime cable channel is because that channel ' s brass think women can relate to reba ' s character ! i absolutely dislike the character of reba hart ' s daughter , kyra . she is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager ! funny , i wonder if the actress who played kyra ; scarlett pomers , is like that in real life away from acting . who plays the blockhead ex-husband dentist , christopher rich , is not much better . barbara jean , played by melissa peterman , is ditsy in herself ! the characters of van and cheyenne are also very annoying . 

something else that baffles me is why the dingbat-of-a-series creator , allison m . gibson , decided to set the series in where i live 25 miles away from ; houston , texas ! reba mcentire isn ' t even from this state , she ' s an oklahoman ! why is it during one season or more they decided to make the incidental music sound like a pig snorting ? what i mean by that is where we hear this baritone saxophone being played with drums accompanying it , but the melodies are basically tuneless !  irwin allen put all his talents behind this one : he ' s co-screenwriter , producer and director of this cartoonish " epic " about an atomic submarine and its efforts to reduce a ring of radiation circling the earth . potentially exciting story fails to take off , despite an eclectic cast . varied players from walter pigeon and joan fontaine to frankie avalon and barbara eden are interestingly intermingled and provide a dash of color , but this soggy sci-fi is pretty cheesy . good for a few stray laughs , but allen didn ' t seem to know the difference between strong , solid adventure and campy nonsense . later a popular tv series . * * from * * * *  greyfriars bobby was not a westie - bobby was a skye terrier . a highlight of my childhood day trips to edinburgh was to go to the monument to bobby . i grew up with the story of the valiant and loyal little dog , as every child in my generation did , and i remember lining up with my mum outside the cinema - with many , many other dundee children and their mums - to see the wonderful disney film . how could a movie based on such a wonderful story have been made using a westie , for heaven ' s sake . that ' s like making a movie about the life of robert burns , for instance , and portraying him as an englishman . i say , give bobby back his breed !  let me begin by saying that i adore the book and loved the a & e miniseries . i was hoping to love this film , and i was absolutely willing to allow it a moderate degree of artistic license in interpreting and abbreviating the actual story . however , this film scarcely resembles the original book . if only " the names had been changed to protect the innocent , " i would have possibly enjoyed the movie as simply an entertaining , if inaccurate , period piece . 

unfortunately , putting the name " mr . darcy " on a character who is emotional and weak , giving the name " elizabeth bennett " to a reckless , snippy , often teary-eyed hoyden who cares nothing for the rules of society , and making " mr . bingley " a wide-eyed dimwit absolutely destroyed the idea that the director had ever read jane austen ' s original story . 

there are some really stellar moments in this movie -- perhaps a total of 10 minutes are truly excellent . charlotte ' s explanation of why she accepted mr . collins ' proposal begins beautifully . she is 27 years old ( quite near the hopeless-spinster age in those times ) , she is becoming a burden on her family , and she is not romantic . she only wants " a comfortable home . " however , the beautiful dialogue is ruined when she blubbers , " don ' t you judge me , elizabeth . don ' t you dare judge me ! " and runs off in tears . later , you see charlotte kowtow to lady catherine de bourgh , which was not at all in her character as described in the book . 

another good moment is when darcy catches elizabeth in his home while she is touring the area with her aunt and uncle . it was well done in the a & e series , but the film version with keira knightley made the audience feel acutely how very humiliating that moment must have been for elizabeth . very nice . 

the ending also illustrated a level of affection between elizabeth and darcy that was not shown as obviously in the miniseries . i actually appreciated that scene , simply because i like to see a happy ending , rather than just know that it took place . 

altogether , though , this movie eliminated the subtlety that was such an integral part of austen ' s pride and prejudice . the characters speak in a jarring combination of austen ' s dialogue verbatim and modern phrases and colloquialisms . information that was only alluded to or suggested in the original work is blatantly stated in this version . yes , time was a concern . it ' s only a short movie , yada yada . but turning a complex , beautiful book into a superficial love story is ridiculous . 

some have commented that they loved the moment when darcy first sees elizabeth , because it is so obviously a case of " love at first sight . " love at first sight ? huh ? one of the best aspects of the book is that elizabeth is not supposed to be a traditional beauty , and darcy comes to love her for her wit and liveliness . . . he literally " loves her for her mind . " 

this version also had a moment ( during darcy ' s first proposal ) when the two are yelling furiously at each other , while leaning closer . . . and closer . . . and almost kissing . . . but they suddenly step apart . ugh ! what a sad clichÃ© . they ' re angry and disgusted with each other , but so attracted that it doesn ' t matter that ( at the time ) they don ' t even like each other ? ridiculous ! 

the characterizations were all so far removed from those described in the book that it really was like a different story . mr . bennet was dour , elizabeth usually acted just as silly as her younger sisters , charlotte was emotional , somewhat unintelligent and desperate for a home of her own -- unlike the intelligent , slightly scheming woman with an abundance of common sense who is portrayed in the novel . jane and elizabeth ' s relationship is merely topical , instead of the deep-rooted love and admiration they are supposed to have for each other . 

all this i could have accepted as merely poor interpretations of the novel , but i refused to accept all that in addition to the many , many historical inaccuracies . miss bingley walked around scarcely clothed ( her dress looked like what the others would wear as tight undergarments ) . elizabeth walked to netherfield with her hair down and allowed to fly all over . the family lazed about one morning , though mornings were supposed to be reserved for calling on acquaintances ( or being called on at your own home ) . elizabeth walked outside barefoot in her nightgown . and in a really appalling scene , bingley walked into jane ' s bedroom and conversed with her ( and sounded like an idiot ) when she was ill . 

most people would feel these are minor points , but i simply wanted either a . ) an historically accurate film , or b . ) an accurate representation of the characters in the novel . 

the director / writer / whoever sacrificed accuracy , subtlety and a good story for a trite tale of love at first sight . i can concede that those who have not read the book or who are not familiar with the social conventions of the time could very easily like this movie , and there is nothing wrong with that . i simply couldn ' t overcome my desire to see a film that involved more than just two pretty faces .  the bearings of western-style feminism on the various subcultures of india have hitherto remained largely non-existent , the two entities belonging to alien realms and threatening ( in the name of tradition ) never to coincide . art imitates life ( or so the claim goes ) and popular hindi cinema is no exception , reflecting an underlying misogyny which , regrettably , forms the foundation of much of the collective indian culture . but why ? what is it about the female gender that has rendered it so hateful to the culture that women are routinely subject to the most unimaginable horrors , including rape , murder , infanticide , imposed illiteracy , infidelity , and the subjugation of spirit that goes under the name of ' dowry ' ? rajkumar santoshi ' s latest offering , " lajja " , asks the same plaintive question , linking the atrocities committed against women through three separate chapters / episodes which comprise the journey of shame endured by its protagonist , vaidehi ( manisha koirala ) . 

direction on santoshi ' s part is not up to par with the level the story demands . he fails to achieve the necessary sensitivity in depicting the saga of sadness and confronts the issue of misogyny from the side , instead of head-on . santoshi has recently said that he did not make the film for an international film festival , but rather for the masses of his country . regrettably , the tackiness shows , and the film too often delves into the action-blood-gore genre that santoshi specializes in . the film suffers from its jerky , episodic pace and its ending is rather too contrived . 

the female cast is given much kinder and more rounded characterizations than their male counterparts . the protagonist is played sensitively by the luminescently beautiful manisha koirala who proves in lajja that she is one of our time ' s more competent leading ladies , and given a proper role and set up , emerges with a truly commendable performance . one wonders how brilliantly she may have shone had the film been made by a director with the appropriate creative intention and appreciation of the issue at hand . mahima choudhary puts in a laudable performance and continues to show that she is an untapped talent . cast as janki , madhuri dixit performs with a never-before-seen fervor and felicity for what truly deserves the name of ' acting . ' the role of a street smart performer who finds solace in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child stands as the greatest risk in her cannon of song-n-dance roles which have maintained her marquee status over the past decade . which leaves the final and most disturbing performance in this would-be feminist saga , that of the ceaselessly talented rekha . lajja is manisha koirala ' s film , there can be no doubt about that , but it is rekha who dominates the proceedings in a performance that digs into your bones and sends echoes of terror through the vestibules of your heart . rekha dazzles as ramdulari , foregoing vanity and complacency to deliver a performance that is so replete with authenticity and ingenuity that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of this portion of the film . comparisons are indeed odious , especially when rendered opposite one of the world ' s great leading ladies , but in the gracious presence of this reigning screen legend the others fade in her shadow . 

 " lajja " has none of the sophistication of proto-feminist dramas like " zubeidaa " , " pinjar " , or even the hell-queen celebration " laadla " : it fulfills its feministic goals in two early moments : the loud tirade in which mahima berates her in-laws for their abuse of her father who has committed no other crime than given birth to a girl . she erupts , leaving the wedding procession in shambles . seeing her father devastated , she begins to weep , blaming herself for the chaotic destruction in front of her . she bemoans , " why did i say anything ? i have ruined everything ! it is all my fault ! " her grandmother , witnessing silently the abuse she bore , comforts her by saying , " why are you crying ? there is no reason for you to be crying . you are not at fault for anything . the fault is mine . the fault is of every woman who came before you , because if we had had the courage to say in our day what you have said today , there would have been no need for you to say anything today . " in this scene the importance of the feminist legacy is laid plainly in sight through words . 

the other , more subtle moment comes very early in the film when vaidehi ( manisha ) has fled from her abusive husband to the refuge of her parents ' home in india . to viewers of western societies , it may seem perfectly reasonable ( indeed , natural ) that any abused woman would seek the protective guardianship of her parents ; this , however , is a societal taboo in many eastern cultures , india among them . once a woman has been married , the identity she assumes is that of her husband and his personal assets ( family , business , children , etc . ) for her to turn her back on these responsibilities is a grave social sin , one which truly has no equivalent for the western woman . she is thereafter regarded as tainted and as ' damaged goods ' , one whose value has been nullified entirely by her own actions and her refusal to submit to the role she has been given . she is not so much an individual as she is an emblem of familial honor . her father rebukes her for her actions , concerned that his familial honor will be tarnished irreparably by the daughter he had already transferred to another man . his primary concern is that of the impending marriage of vaidehi ' s younger sister , a prospect made far less likely with a divorced elder daughter in the same household . he tells her in no uncertain that she must return to the man to whom she lawfully belongs , however violent and sadistic he may be . he levies against her the age old adage that , " the honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter . " quietly and pensively , she replies , " yes , the honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter . but there is no honor for the daughter herself . "  scarlet dawn casts douglas fairbanks , jr . as a russian baron rudely displaced by the forces of the russian revolution and now has to fend for himself in a world not terribly hospitable to former aristocrats . he ' s also not terribly suited for any kind of real work . 

doug might have been caught by the reds but for the fact that his former servant nancy carroll didn ' t give him away . nancy ' s got a big old crush on doug and they do marry once arriving in exile in istanbul which throughout the film is referred to by its former christian name of constantinople . they marry and settle down with doug now reduced to washing dishes . 

but fairbanks ' s former mistress lilyan tashman who ' s always playing bad girls of a sort on film spots him and offers to have him get back into somewhat the style he was once accustomed to as part of a swindle against father and daughter american tourists guy kibbee and sheila terry . 

good thing this film has the incredibly short running time of only 57 minutes , usually those were given to b westerns because it ' s both tedious and melodramatic . the ending is rather unbelievable . doug knew he was in a thanksgiving special and really overacts to cover up the defects of a unbelievable story . 

what i didn ' t understand was that fairbanks was trained in the military profession , why didn ' t he just become a mercenary soldier after leaving the new soviet union ? that didn ' t make sense to me at all . 

i ' d only see this if i was a dedicated fan of any the main players .  if this is the best commander hamilton movie , i have no curiosity about the others . 

a movie actor ' s greatest tools are his eyes , but when peter stormare wants to show great emotion , he closes his , so for five or six seconds we get to admire his eyelids while his feelings remain unknown behind them . lousy acting technique . 

stormare also flinches sometimes when he fires a gun , turning his head away and clamping his eyes shut . watch carefully . james bond can rest easy with competition like this . 

there are some interesting supporting performances from other actors , but not enough to hang a whole movie on . the cinematography is good-looking , doing a fine job of capturing the nordic cold . even the sahara winds up looking cold . perhaps hamilton carries his own climate with him . 

there are some individual good action sequences here . unfortunately , the only sense of humor on screen belongs to the villain , which turns the hero into a big pill . james bond ' s jokes may not be particularly good , but at least he doesn ' t look constipated all the time . 

one positive point in the movie ' s favor is that the psychotic , contorted , vicious hatred of israel in guillou ' s books has been left out . what has been kept in is worship of a noble , heroic plo , that he shows us functioning in libya without the dictator khaddafi ' s knowledge or supervision . this fantasy is hard to believe , since khaddafi actually threw the plo out of libya for four years at a time . and at the end of the film , hamilton gives the plo a very disturbing gift . where will they use that gift ? hamilton doesn ' t care . 

we ' re a long , long way away from " for whom the bell tolls " here . 

commander hamilton will remain a local phenomenon . while henning mankell ' s books sell well around the world , jan guillou will never have the same success . 

as for this film , bleeeeaaahhhhh .  danny de vito shows us here he is definitely , indeed infinitely , a better on screen performer than off . he plays the part of owen , a miserable would-be writer with a cranky old mother ( delightfully played by anne ramsey ) he would like to see dead . billy crystal is larry , a very frustrated writing teacher who has an estranged wife he feels the same way about . so owen , after viewing hitchcock ' s " strangers on a train " , suggests they swap murders . 

as director though , de vito ' s control is inconsistent as he wastes this clever idea , while his film lurches from the very humorous to the very bland . he and crystal are okay in the lead roles , but the show belongs to anne ramsey as the cantankerous mrs . lift . 

saturday , june 20 , 1992 - video this movie , which i just discovered at the video store , has apparently sit around for a couple of years without a distributor . it ' s easy to see why . the story of two friends living in new york searching for their pal from high school who is now living homeless under the boardwalk at coney island , has flashes of being a very good film , but ultimately is weighted down by the story focusing on stan and daniel , rather than on their homeless friend richie . cryer is as usual very good and the film has a nice stark look to it , with the ghostly images of coney island . however , writer cryer and director richard schenkman are too busy dealing with the fairly uninteresting lives of stan and daniel rather than focusing on richie . one flashback in a music store , where richie has a crush on an employee stands out and really shows the viewer where this film could have gone . but in the end , not much . two many drawn out scenes of annoyance , such as inside the skeeball building . rating 4 out of 10 .   * * * spoiler alert * * * disjointed and confusing arson drama that has to do with a sinister plan to burn down a major vacation resort before new years day . being insured for ten million dollars the man behind valley view estates in the blue mountains in australia julian fane , guy doleman , is determined to bring his own project down in flames in order to collect . this has to happen by january 1 , two weeks hence , before the insurance policy on the project runs out . 

with his mind totally on his work builder and architect howard anderson , tom skerritt , has no idea that his boss , julian fane , is planning to burn down the resort he ' s building and possibly set him up as the fall guy . anderson gets a bit suspicious when insurance investigator sophie mccann , wendy hughes , informs him on some very fishy goings on between fane and the insurance company proud alliance . it turns out that proud allience is actually owned , or 60 % of it , by fane himself ! this explains whey fane is having all these arson fires happen in order to collect the ten million dollars of insurance which is at least twice as much as the entire valley view estates is worth ! 

we later have sophie mccann murdered , in a faked swimming accident , to keep her from finding out whats happening with the suspicious fries around and in valley view estates . it ' s when lloyd ' s of london , who ' s underwriting proud alliance , insurance investigator george engles , james mason , shows up that fane takes a powder leaving his ace arsonist on his own and out of control to blow fane ' s entire plan . 

meanwhile anderson has gotten wise to both fane and engles who unlike fane wants the valley view estates to go under for reasons which are never made quite clear , just watch the last few seconds of the film to realize that , by it ' s writer and director . the arsonist is exposed as he ' s about to do in his girlfriend with anderson coming to her rescue . we then have this wild chase scene with the arsonist getting lost in the valley view construction site only to have it set on fire , with the help of howard anderson , where he ends up burning to a crisps by the time the fire department came to hose him down . 

the sudden and unexplained ending never made clear to just what happened to the big cheese in this whole scheme of things the sinister and evil minded julian fane . it ' s as if fane got away scot-free and only his unstable and deranged henchman , the arsonist , who was only the instrument of fane ' s crimes ended up as the only person who payed from them .  go to the video store and get the original . i do not understand why hollywood has that need to take a perfect foreign movie and remake it . " mostly martha " or " bella martha " has a much better cast . beginning with the heroine martina gedeck , who convinced me much more in the role of the work-obsessed perfectionist than the more famous catherine zeta jones , to the italian cook and the niece suddenly deprived of her mother and forced to live with an aunt , not fit for child-rearing . 

in many ways , the american version of the movie is a copy of the german original . they just exchanged the actors . however , they also changed the story because it would have been difficult and not very believable to materialize a father for the little girl in an american context . 

i was thinking about that . maybe the father could have been puerto rican , or cuban , or mexican . well , there are so many " guest workers " in the u . s . take your pick . but i doubt that any of them would have shown up to shoulder the responsibility as the italian father did in the original . therefore , the american movie leaves that part out but keeps the italian cook . and by doing this the whole story changes . in the original " martha " is so removed from reality that she thinks it is okay to send her niece off with a complete stranger in a foreign country . 

the american " martha " is softer and therefore the movie is sweeter and does not have that edge the german movie has . 

in the original the " italian " cook is not so good looking but much more charming , the little girl is more of a brat but much more believable and " martha " is more representative of a career woman in today ' s world than the watered down version we are presented in the american version . and the whole opera music in the american version was very annoying . i loved the italian songs in the original and bought the cd . 

hollywood recognized that " mostly martha " was a great movie . maybe the distribution companies should have put it in more theaters or it should have been shown in english without subtitles . in any case , the original is so much better . by the way this reminds me of another remake . " shall we dance " is one of my favorites in the original japanese version and totally forgettable in the american version .  a chilling and gory tale of a couple inheriting a 150 room italian castle while still grieving the loss of their young son . the couples marriage seems to be on the rocks due to the car accident that took the life of their son and left their daughter blind . upon taking inventory of the castle for a future sale a hideous , tortured and misshapen creature breaks lose from the bowels of the 12th century castle . pretty gory with great horror atmosphere and some sexual overtones . starring jeffrey combs , barbara crampton , jessica dollarhide and elisabeth kaza .  perhaps the wildest outlier in alfred hitchcock ' s career is this straight-out comedy vehicle by the director , pairing carole lombard with robert montgomery as a couple who discover a mistake has invalidated their marriage . where do they really stand with each other ? 

contrary to what others say , there is an element of suspense here : the idea that these two miserable people might escape each other , free to inflict their awfulness on some other , undeserving mate . 

it ' s funny reading comments here about how miserable lombard ' s ann smith plays out in this film , because montgomery ' s role is as much of a heel . he manhandles ann , snaps at witnesses , short-shrifts clients - just the kind of lawyer who gives his profession a bad name . ann is overbearing , too , of course , the kind of wife who holds her husband hostage from work for six days over a petty squabble , bringing up things like what he did in paris when he was 20 and hadn ' t even met her yet . " i forgave you that ! " she says , as if it was big of her . 

for david , a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have a little illicit pleasure with his " mistress " before tying the knot for good . for ann , it ' s an attempt at premarital sex that must be repelled with a bottle of champagne to the head , followed by expulsion from their apartment and her life . 

the acorn doesn ' t seem to fall far from the tree , as ann ' s mother is scandalized into apoplexy when she learns what david tried to pull : " oh my poor baby ! thank heaven your father is dead ! " 

that ' s a rare good line in this laughless , unlikeable comedy . 

you can call this an example of the " remarriage comedy " , in which the bonds of matrimony are challenged in order to be reaffirmed . you can also call this an example of what roger ebert calls the " idiot plot " , in which the storyline depends on the main characters acting like idiots . hitchcock seems to have a laugh at uptight american morality , but can ' t really do much more with it than a jokeless scene where an older couple is scandalized by the sound of loud plumbing . 

lombard died within a year of this film ' s release ; it was the last film of hers she lived to see . what a shame it couldn ' t have been something better ! she was overbearing in " my man godfrey " , too , but in such a likable way you didn ' t just have to go with her , you wanted to . here she plays for laughs that aren ' t there while sadistically breaking david ' s chops again and again . montgomery rolls his eyes a lot like groucho , a study in smugitude . 

the only really decent thing in this movie that lasts more than a few seconds is gene raymond as david ' s law partner jeff custer , who makes a play for ann and acts with honor and decency . raymond underplays his many reaction shots , and even a drunk scene , all to good effect . 

 * * * spoiler * * * so decent a guy is jeff that ann ends up rejecting him for not fighting david after she goads him into a confrontation , calling custer " a lump of jelly " . jeff exits the scene , leaving ann and david together for their future murder-suicide . here ' s one custer that managed to escape a massacre ! * * * spoiler end * * *  after watching this film , i thought to myself , they really glossed up errol flynn ' s life ! the movie is really nice eye candy . they really got the 1930s and 1940s atmosphere of hollywood just right . the costumes were great . all the women looked glamorous and all the men looked handsome and debonair . 

is this a serious film about errol flynn ' s life ? nah ! it ' s a fun movie based on all the scandalous stuff he did in his life . 

why am i critiquing this film ? this is a film that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver . duncan reagher was really good as errol flynn . he was not as good looking as the original , but he made you believe that flynn was not just a handsome playboy who did not take himself seriously , but as a man who , although gifted with great talent , was kind of disturbed and unhappy inside . flynn ' s love life was a disaster considering he had so many failed marriages . he also lost a lot of good friends during his life . he also suffered from unrequited love for the elegant olivia dehavilland . the last scene of the film showed errol kind of begging for olivia to stay with him and instead she walks away . he is shown in his tux , looking really empty and slowly walking around the pool as he pours his drink into the pool . it was a sad way to end the film but kind of fitting because everyone knows by now how he eventually fell apart from his alcoholism and his dissipated lifestyle . 

this film could ' ve had much more depth , could ' ve been better well-written . sure they showed all the scandals but they never showed errol flynn ' s human center . surprisingly , duncan reagher was able to put some emotional depth into the character of errol flynn even though the film writing didn ' t put any depth there . 

i ' ll probably never see this film again but i can still remember after viewing this film , " gosh , this could ' ve been so much more . . . . . ! " i give this film a d+ .  this appears to be two movies spliced into one . in the first , zasu pitts is a renegade in a small town . she wants to help the romantic life of marjorie woodworth . ok : i ' d never heard of her before either . but she and pitts are in both parts of this concoction . 

before we know it , pitts is no longer miss {polly . she is emmie . i had to rewind to see if i ' d fallen asleep somewhere . i hadn ' t . she no longer in a small town but on her way to the title honeymoon destination . 

the movie has some cute moments . the first part is better , with roles for what seems to be every third-rate character actress working in hollywood at the time . 

and what of ms . woolworth ? she sounds a little like betty hutton . she sounds a little like marie wilson . she ' s pretty , certainly . but she ' s no comedienne . 

pitts often was used in very small roles . here she has the largest role . she ' s always fun , though this movie made me wonder if a little of her doesn ' t go quite a long way . ( as a comic . when she was a tragic actress in von stroheim silents -- " the wedding march " and greed " are the two i have seen -- she was brilliant . )  this show is pretty alright and fun to watch , its a great disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining . 

i really enjoyed the first season but i hated the second and third seasons . this show has completely changed around . in the first season it was more about science and animals , all that is gone now in the season and third season . its more about her life and dating . ever since that gay kid ( ben ) came along , this show has sucked . the writers took a perfectly good kid show and changed it to a crappy teen comedy . disney took a turn for the worse . i cant stand to watch the newest episodes anymore , they ' re all garbage .  oh boy ! it was just a dream ! what a great idea ! mr lynch is very lucky most people try to tell classical stories . this way he can play with his little plantings and his even more little payoffs . check out polanski ' s " the lodger " for far more intelligent mix of fantasy and reality .  julie andrews satirically prods her own goody-two-shoes image in this overproduced musical comedy-drama , but if she approaches her role with aplomb , she ' s alone in doing so . blake edwards ' film about a woman who is both music-hall entertainer and german spy during wwi doesn ' t know what tone to aim for , and rock hudson has the thankless task of playing romantic second-fiddle . musicals had grown out of favor by 1970 , and elephantine productions like " star ! " and this film really tarnished andrews ' reputation , leaving a lot of dead space in her catalogue until " the tamarind seed " came along . i ' ve always thought julie andrews would ' ve made a great villain or shady lady ; her strong voice could really command attention , and she hits some low notes that can either be imposing or seductive . husband / director edwards seems to realize this , but neither he nor julie can work up much energy within this scenario . screenwriter william peter blatty isn ' t a good partner for edwards , and neither man has his heart in this material . beatty ' s script offers andrews just one fabulous sequence--a striptease . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  this was the first chan film made by monogram . what a come down from fox values and standards ! i was shocked when i saw my first monogram after seeing the great fox films . this is boring and uninspired with wild music playing as chan calmly walks across the street . chan is now working for the us secret service rather than the honolulu police department . he is assisted by benson fong , who plays no . 3 son tommy for the first time . he also has a daughter along , iris chan , played by marianne quon . mantan moreland also makes his debut as birmingham brown . he is a cab driver in washington , dc , here , rather than the later chauffeur to chan in the later films .  hitchcock is a great director . ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch . i admire hitchcok on a purely visual and technical level . 

first the positives . hitchcock invented the notion of the probing camera . the curious eye that is able to withhold or search for information . it isn ' t exactly a new visual grammar but it was revolutionary then . 

secondly , hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie . he has an economical style and is always thinking of the audience . he gives them regular thrills , regular jolts of humour and regular shocks . in short , he anticipates the audience ' s base needs and plays them like a fiddle . 

unfortunately , the base needs of a human being are mostly stupid . food , sex , the thrill of danger and a little comedy . hithcock caters for all these needs on screen , with the exception of food , which , judging from his size , he catered to off screen . 

it ' s this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films . a second downside is that most of hitchcock ' s camera work and visual grammar are now common place . what keeps his films watchable are the simple economy of his tales , the intelligence of his camera work , and his skill at crafting tense action set pieces . 

so on to " saboteur " . this is a light-hearted romp in the vein of " the 39 steps " . it jumps from sequence to sequence , until it concludes at the typical hitchcock final act set piece . 

on an emotional level , the relationship between the leads is not up to par with robert donat and madeleine caroll in " the 39 steps " . hence the whole story lacks a certain energy . the plot simply rumbles on like a machine , desperately depending on the addition of new scenes . and new scenes only bring us nearer the end , since it ' s not clear if the hook is the hero ' s escape from the police , from the villains or his action to stop the plotted sabotages . 

there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws . for example , a guy with handcuffs frees himself using a car fan belt etc . ( why doesn ' t he just drive away in the car ? surely handcuffs aren ' t that restrictive ? he ' s able to swim in them , after all ! ) 

if you want a better hitchcock wartime propaganda flick from the 40 ' s , i would advise you watch " foreign correspondant " . they are both silly chase movies with a catchy finale , but " foreign correspondant " makes great use of umbrellas and tulips , something spielberg rips off nicely in " minority report " . 

7 . 5 / 10 - some good set pieces . beyond that , however , there ' s nothing much to sink your teeth into .  a young woman , jodie foster , is witnessing a mafia murder , reports the killing to the local police , and becomes herself a hit target by the mob operatives . a professional killer , dennis hopper , hired by mafia , is stalking her to prepare for the hit , but eventually he falls for her . then , as a parody of the stockholm syndrome that defines a case when an abducted hostage begins to like and cooperate with the kidnapper , jodie foster falls for her abductor too , make love , and both prepare for a getaway . 

denis hopper , the actor , tries to align himself with the creative ambitions of dennis hopper , the director . the result is disappointing , and fails to keep pace with the artistic level of a great performer as dennis hopper is . there is no real thrill and the script is sometimes naive and predictable . the film is saved to some extent by the performance of jodie foster who is not at her best , but still shines with her talent , beauty and gift . of historical interest is the short appearance of vincent price , and , in a small act , of charlie sawn known from his great part in " wall street " . 

if you decide to spend the 116 minutes to see the film , it is not a complete loss ; this movie offers easy entertainment , but we would expect much more from the director of " easy rider " , and the actress who gave us the character of sarah tobias in " the accused " .  i ' m sure a lot of guys will love this movie . the only woman who shows any " balls " ( unfortunate pun regretted ) is made to look , talk , and seem like a guy , the other 2 women are portrayed either as sexual objects with one thing on their mind- sex / being sexy , with sex as their only attribute and skill ( iris ) - or as freaked out pretty little princesses who ' s neurosis negates any strength and professional authority they had before all hell broke lose ( doc ) . the only strength iris has in the end is the result of some advice from a big strong man . besides my negative gut reaction as a feminist , i have to give the camera work props- and ethan hawke is great in the very first scene . after that his performance loses steam . empty entertainment for a brain that wants to take it easy . at least the film skims the subject of the duality of good / bad in the criminal mind .  nothing could be more appealing than the idea of a good love story featuring kristin scott thomas and harrison ford . the cool , refined english beauty and the warm-blooded american male -- what could possibly be more lovely ? well , this is not that movie . right away they ruin it by casting kristin scott thomas as an american congresswoman . that ' s like casting hugh grant as babe ruth . or colin firth as al capone . kristin scott thomas is exactly the sort of woman you don ' t picture shaking hands with greasy ex-junkies in filthy slums , or squeezing into smelly crowds and kissing babies . she would have been far better cast as the english born widow of an aristocratic senator , the kind who belongs to the hunt club and goes to flower shows but has no idea how the other half lives . 

then there ' s harrison ford as a regular guy cop . certainly he ' s tough enough for the role . but the idea that he ' s going to romance this stunning high society beauty is a bit hard to swallow . why couldn ' t he have been , say , a tough but wealthy reform politician with blue-collar roots who inherits kristin ' s late husband ' s senate seat ? the two of them are initially quite cool to each other , but for duty ' s sake kristin is cordial to him , and he in return starts showing her some of the rawer side of life -- things her husband sheltered her from . her political awakening coincides with the jolting passion of a newer , more blue collar , lover -- one who appreciates her polish and refinement far more than her aristocratic husband . now that ' s a love story ! instead of that , though , you get a blank , meaningless " thriller " where the action drags and nothing happens . well , there is one ghetto style " drive by " scene where harrison almost gets killed , but it ' s so abrupt and unexplained it ' s really more like welcome comic relief . 

the sky is always gray in this movie , and our refined , lovely kristin always looks a little chilled . when she ' s supposed to be dreaming of passion , she looks more like she ' s dreaming of a wool blanket and a cup of tea ! she also looks a bit sleepy most of the time , like she ' d really rather be napping in the bed than screwing harrison ford . 

all things considered , i ' d say you can ' t blame her .  i liked the understated character that laura linney played in ' love actually ' , and she is very good in ' man of the year ' . 

but wow . robin williams doesn ' t give that much of a performance , with a couple of minor exceptions this was weak . laura linney may not have been miscast , but either the editing raped her character , or this was just a sad performance by director barry levinson . 

and i think it was barry levinson that got old . so many weak performances , such uneven results have to be the fault of management . 

christopher walken and jeff goldblum are great in supporting roles . goldblum plays a sinister side with relish , and walken ' s combination of entertainer ' s manager and commentator for the film is wonderful . 

but the story is clichÃ© , the presentation looks like it could have ( should have ) been a very good picture , and too many actions are half-hearted . the pacing , story , and direction all come up weak , compared to , say ' head office ' ( spoof of ' secret of my success ' ) .  propaganda pro-american war effort film that came out in 1942 has the east side kids getting tough against any japanese they spot in their own neighborhood when they learn they ' re too young to enlist . ultimately they learn they were mistaken in their mistrust of some individuals but also happen to stumble across a spy ring they then set out to bust . the film is harmless enough in its fashion although some may well take offense given how innocent asians really did get singled out during the second world war . overall though , it ' s a pretty generic effort and both leo gorcey and huntz hall would have better moments , the best of which tend to come here when they ad-lib .  joe was first released in the us in the summer of 1970 . despite respectable notices , reasonable box office and an oscar nom , it vanished shortly afterwards and remained forgotten about throughout the 1980 ' s , before being enthusiastically reappraised , somewhat unjustly , in the us in the late 90 ' s . thanks to this lengthy unavailability , its reputation has gone on to see it placed ( inexplicably ) alongside the likes of michael winner ' s original death wish . although revenge is a theme , a film about vigilantism this most definitely is not . 

the plot isn ' t worth synopsizing . its a flabby , hammy and bizarrely stagey ramble about an accidental murder and the unlikely relationship that blossoms out of it . that relationship and the largely class-based quirks of its two leads are exaggerated into ridiculous caricature ; these two , and their situation , bear absolutely no relation to reality . 

almost everything about the film is cantankerous and begrudgingly antiquated , which makes the whole thing completely fascinating . hippies are depicted as snide and exclusive misanthropes , hard drugs either make you sleep or dance around maniacally with lipstick on your face , and most young women are prepared to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana at the drop of a fly . its very much a film of the 60 ' s rather than the 70 ' s , so why some industry luminaries have begun to include it in retrospective conversations about the beginnings of the hollywood new wave is a complete mystery . martin scorcese of all people even got involved , though probably only to give a nod to the dank , lavatorial hues of the grim urban cinematography , which almost certainly influenced taxi driver four years later . but joe seems very much like a furious tirade against the likes of easy rider and bonnie and clyde , rather than a continuation of that same insurgent cinematic ethos . 

it isn ' t a film of any real artistic significance - despite joe ' s incontinent fury at everything in his world , it remains a story about absolutely nothing - but its value as a cultural museum piece is unprecedented . shot on and around the streets of new york city during the darkest hours of the vietnam war , and at a time when america ( and , significantly , its cinema ) was being revolutionized to the horror of the old guard , the film ends up , in its own completely oblivious and accidental way , saying more about that period of history than numerous infinitely superior movies that directly endeavored to capture it . 

but as a film ? despite a really surprising and effective shock ending , this is basically a michael winner film , but not as well made . how does that tickle your fancy ? * * incidentally , if you are , like me , a fan of spotting arbitrary background lookalikes , then check out harold steptoe at 1 : 22 : 11 in the hippy art gallery .  the most famous thing about this movie is that this was the first time garbo talked in a motion picture . aside from that ' milestone ' ( if you want to call it that ) this is a movie that doesn ' t go beyond creaky melodrama , with garbo trying her best not to fall asleep . 

the plot involves greta garbo returning to her father after 15 years abroad . her father , who is a captain on a barge , is happy to see her , even though she ' s acting a bit cagey . she soon falls in love with a grizzled seaman , who also notices that something , a barrier if you will , is holding her back . 

anyways , the two fellows don ' t particularly like each other and soon come to blows over garbo , when she diffuses the situation by revealing her big secret which is no surprise to us , if you ' ve read the video box ( damn you mgm ! ! ) garbo is nothing but arms in this movie , she acts and acts flailing her arms about , and gets grating quickly . the two male leads are alright . probably the best performance comes from the classic silent actress marie dressler , who plays the drunken captain ' s even drunker girlfriend . what a performance ! it ' s too bad the tagline couldn ' t have read , " dressler talks ! "  potential viewers be warned , the current imdb viewer rating for " tomorrow at seven " is an anomaly of low voter turnout . it has an interesting premise , a killer leaves an ace of spades calling card at the scene of his crimes , while alerting the victim in advance . the execution falls flat however , and to say that the movie has it ' s share of plot holes would be to imply that there actually is a plot . 

chester morris portrays mystery writer neil broderick , weaving elements of actual murders by the ace of spades killer into his latest novel . broderick intends to interview a wealthy businessman for his book , but first he has to get past the man ' s eccentric secretary - " if you line his relatives up , you ' d have enough nuts to hold a ford together " . that line unceremoniously endears him to the " nut ' s " daughter martha ( vivienne osborne ) , who offers to make the introductions . 

broderick meets thornton drake ( henry stephenson ) just as the latter is about to complete a jigsaw puzzle delivered by a courier that morning . the only remaining pieces , as we learn in the following scene , form the bold , black shape of the ace of spades containing the words " at seven tomorrow night " . now what person putting together a puzzle doesn ' t use the pieces with contrasting colors first ! 

initially i was intrigued by the appearance of frank mchugh and allen jenkins in their roles as a pair of police detectives summoned to the drake residence . generally , their characters are colorful enough to offer genuine comic relief , but here they ' re just plain annoying . mchugh ' s clancy in particular winds up shouting objections to inane comments made by his partner dugan , and both usually head in the opposite direction when real trouble might turn up . 

now here ' s a question - in light of the identity of the ace killer , why would he have invited a novelist and a pair of cops that he just met , on a flight to his louisiana plantation ? especially when at seven o ' clock , all parties would be a captive audience aboard the plane when the first murder is committed . it ' s not drake however who ' s dead , but his secretary austin winters ( grant mitchell ) . the early suspicion falls on pilot henderson ( cornelius keefe ) following a lights out scene , but henderson still hasn ' t reported the murder to his supervisor until well after he arrives at drake ' s plantation with everyone else . can you imagine anyone trying to get away with that today , unless your name was ted kennedy ? 

with the cause of death yet to be determined , the local coroner is called in , but the first one that shows up ( a broderick accomplice ) is a phony . yet , when the real coroner shows up , he simply disappears immediately after ! in a second dark out scene , a letter from the murder victim austin winters is about to be read . it winds up missing when the lights return , and because it may point to the murderer , it becomes a clue that must be retrieved . so where was the letter ? winters ' daughter martha grabbed it and placed in on the mantle of the living room ! how much thought was put into this ? 

obviously , the entire affair is so inane that morris ' character solves the case rather easily . even though the film comes in at just about an hour , it becomes almost a chore to watch with all the nonsense going on . there ' s really only one humorous moment worth repeating ; while aboard the plane , the detectives have this exchange : dugan - " hey clancy , how often do these things fall ? " clancy - " once ! " 

except for mchugh and jenkins , i can ' t say i ' ve seen any of the other players in films of the era , though i ' m a fan of most " b " grade mystery movies from the ' 30 ' s through the ' 50 ' s . fortunately , the pair fares much better backing up humphrey bogart in a goofy 1938 gem - " swing your lady " , where the laughs are intentional . the best i can offer about " tomorrow at seven " is a quote from martha winters about midway though this turkey - " this is just a silly waste of time " .  i know we shouldn ' t expect much from a low-budget indie film . but the idea behind it is sound : an attempt to open america ' s eyes to the cozy relationship between the government , and the journalists that are supposed to be keeping an eye out against it . but somehow the documentary aspect of it , takes away from its drama . the protests during the 2004 republican convention in new york were not that compelling to make a documentary about it . those kinds of compelling protests belong to the era of the 1960 ' s . 

it would have been better to stick to a drama format . perhaps a slow build-up where the young journalist ' s eyes are gradually opened up to the conspiracy .  mansfield park , in its second half , is my favorite of austen ' s novels , and fanny price my favorite of her heroines , so i ' m saddened by the unhappy fate she ' s suffered in her big- and small-screen representations . the only good reading of the character i ' ve heard was done for radio by amanda root , who gave it the same quality as she did the character anne in the film of " persuasion " : a stern , sure , heartfelt moral centeredness . if the actress had been younger she would have been good visual casting as well ; but the fannys that have reached our eyes to date have more resembled , respectively : mary crawford ; ruby the scullery girl ; and ( in this incarnation ) a jovial serving wench , or possibly tart , with her high moral principles pulled down a peg . 

well , i had hoped for better , but had feared worse . the serial had a solid edmund , in an actor who was best at likable saps , and the perfect , i . e . perfectly abominable , mrs . norris ; otherwise it was dullish . the film , which was apparently intended as a deconstruction or some other bad theatrical idea , came off as a mixed-up burlesque . after such disappointments , and the more recent disappointments of this production ' s sister pieces ( the new " persuasion " and " northanger abbey " ) , i couldn ' t help but have mixed expectations for this one ; and on the whole , it left me feeling slightly better disposed to it than not . it condensed the novel intelligently , and in the end left me with much the same feeling , as a comic-book version might . on the other hand , to do so it had to rework most of the characters , except the crawfords , and it incidentally diminished or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book , including its most famous character and what should be , if it isn ' t , its most famous scene . 

the character is the officious aunt norris , always ready to direct other people in what to do , but always managing to avoid having to do any of it herself ; here one gets no sense of that at all . and with her goes much else : her remark that cuts through fanny , " . . . considering who and what you are " ; sir thomas ' s discovery that she has forbidden fanny a fire in her room all these years , and his roundabout apology for her ; fanny ' s honesty in acknowledging , during a visit home , that aunt norris , for all her faults , could manage the household better than either of her sisters . but then , that entire trip is missing from the story , and so is most of what goes on at the theatrical rehearsals and most of what discomfits sir thomas on his return ; and in fact sir thomas himself , and his wife , are different from what they were . above all , the scene in which crawford proposes to fanny , one of austen ' s most complex , is simplified to a bare telling ; missing from it is fanny ' s staunch upholding of what she knows to be right , and what she knows to be very probably true , against all the distractions crawford and anybody else can throw at her . to a male reader , now no less than when it was written , it reveals with unmatched clarity--unmatched , at any rate , as far as i know--what a woman goes through in trying to deal fairly but firmly with a man she has reason to distrust . it ' s a brilliant scene , in the novel ; on tv it ' s just a scene . 

and , fanny , oh , fanny : when will we see your like ?  celebrity singers have always had a tough time breaking into the movies ( the cinema is littered with failed attempts ) , and one can go on and on speculating why john mellencamp never made it big as an actor . instead of taking small parts in heartfelt projects , mellencamp dives right in playing the lead in " falling from grace " , which he also directed , and the results are as awkward and unbecoming as that title . story of a famous singer returning to his hometown in the sticks , opening up old family wounds , boasts a screenplay by larry mcmurtry , but the meandering film goes nowhere slowly . the supporting cast is decent , including kay lenz ( whom it ' s always nice to see ) , mariel hemingway and claude akins ( who share the one really strong scene in the picture ) . as for john ' s acting , he doesn ' t look particularly comfortable , despite apparent efforts to make him look at home ; he seems to be ducking the camera most of the time , and he never connects with the audience in an immediate way . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  with some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made . huevos de oro seems to aim at the well educated spanish middle class . there must be many inside jokes in this movie which you will not understand if you are an outsider . this can be pretty annoying . 

symbols and references to art and popular culture abound , the movie alludes to the work of salvador dalÃ­ , luis buÃ±uel and the surrealists in general , a certain infatuation with bidet baths seems to point to duchamp ' s ready mades . what ' s more , the main character has also a knack for karaoke tapes with songs of julio iglesias . but why all this is mixed together in a rather pretty but also gratuitous way simply eludes me . i can only guess that it all serves to highlight the vital , impetuous , boorish vulgarity of the main character who the director seems to admire and despise at the same time . how all the really pretty women run after him ( the main character , i mean ) is slightly disconcerting . 

the movie has three parts . it starts in the spanish enclave of melilla in africa , where benito , the main character , does his military service , apparently in the corps of engineers . then it moves on to the resort town of benidorm in spanin where benito just wants to build the highest skyscraper of the place and become a vulgarized howard roark . for the last part a defeated benito moves to miami , florida , presumably in order to start a Ânew life " . but the change of places is not really explained satisfactorily . it is also somehow irritating that there is no character development and that the movie descends into a soap opera modus without being convincingly ironic . it must be said that javier bardem acquits himself very well playing the young stud who grows limp and deflated . 

i purchased this movie because i am interested in townscapes . and benidorm is a kind of a special place , townscapewise . in this aspect huevos de oro satisfied me only partially . in jess franco ' s she killed in ecstasy ( 1970 ) this specific location was used in a more rewarding way .  an obvious vanity press for julie in her first movie with blake . let ' s see . where do we begin . she is a traitor during a world war ; she redeems that by falling in love ; her friends ( who are presumably patriots because they are german citizens ) are expendable and must die ; and she winds up as a heroine . ok . the scenes with the drunken pilot and the buffoons who work for french intelligence can ' t even be described , and we won ' t even mention rock ' s romantic scenes with a female . ( by the way , when they visit a museum , look at his gaze - i reran it on video and it ' s priceless ) . is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie ? i don ' t know and you won ' t either .  before i begin , let me get something off my chest : i ' m a huge fan of john eyres ' first film project : shadowchaser . the film , a b-grade cross of both the terminator & die hard , may not be the work of a cinematic genius , but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit ( & spawned two sequels & a spin off ) . 

judge and jury begins with joseph meeker , a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so-called " bloody shootout " ( which seems like a poor name for a killing spree Â meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store ) , being led to the electric chair . there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love ( who was killed during the shootout ) , expressing his revenge for the person who killed her Â michael silvano , a washed-up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team ( and ends up harassing his son ' s coach ) . but once executed , meeker returns as a revenant ( or as kelly perine calls " a hamburger without the fries " ) , whose sole aim is to get his revenge , which basically means making silvano ' s life a misery . 

let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film . it is a supernatural action film , with meeker chasing silvano , using his ability to change form ( which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator , a french chef ( with an accent as bad as his moustache ) , a drag queen , a clown & a stand-up comedian ) , a shotgun which fires explosive rounds & an invulnerability to death ( although that doesn ' t stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle ) , to pay silvano back for killing meeker ' s wife . 

director john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations , instead focusing solely on action scenes , which the film has plenty of . but that is the film ' s main flaw , since there ' s nothing to connect the action scenes together . the acting is surprisingly good , with keith delivering the best performance , supported ably by kove , as well as paul koslo , who plays the washed-up cop quite well . kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse .  for the first fifteen minutes the story of naked fame is interesting : two late thirties male porn stars in a seemingly healthy relationship decide to leave the porn industry and try for the world of singing and acting . the two very buff and preening men are colton ford and blake harper . with the aid of kevin aviance and marc berkely , colton makes a dance track that is then marketed in new york with the hopes that colton ford will become an instant star - a unique disco singer touting his background as a porn star for pr . 

the remainder of the film is grumbling and in-fighting and commentary by porn producer chichi larue and the film slowly sinks into repetition and doldrums . not a bad idea for a film if there were a bit more depth revealed in each character ' s drive to move away form a successful career ( though one greatly influenced by the youth both characters have lost ) into an alternative one . it is just that a one-note song wears thin quickly . grady harp , november 05 her bit-part as a masseuse , in the lurid sequel to the original ' emmannuelle ' , evidently gave someone the bright idea of putting a spanner in the works of the french soft-core series ' gambit by inverting the caucasian carnality and casting javan stunner gemser in a leading role in this , the rather tame first of a series of sexploiters that became increasingly depraved as sleazier directors took on in-name-only sequels . 

someone ( and surely not the english-language over-haulers warner ? ) was also anticipating an ' a star is born ' type meteoric rise out the results , judging by the way the actress is credited merely with the eponymous moniker of the on-screen heroine , albeit with a couple of consonants sacrificed as insurance against litigation . 

gemser ' s tenure in the series saw her as an ' intrepid ' photographer , allowing of course for all manner of subsequent globe-trotting adventures . but , whilst she may well have been one the very most beautiful actresses on the screen at that time , any thespian talent that may have been there to discern becomes mired in the same sort of unfeasibly facile cogitation ( " i have to confess that since i ' ve been in africa , i find white skin less appealing . . . " ) that was to be found in the french films . 

and in this particular entry , much to the consternation of the raincoat brigade the essence of on-screen carnality is as much to be found in puerile symbolism ( pumping engine pistons ! ) as it is in prosaic couplings - although naturally these include generous dollops of ' exploratory ' lesbianism . connoiseurs of kitsch are however guaranteed a continuous stream of aural delights , what with such epithets of ethnographic wisdom as " i do nothing to be a perfect black , she does everything to be a perfect white " .  brought to you by the following among others :

( lmao ) 

3- anti-defamation league ( adl ) funny how adl supports this hateful propaganda . you can never tell by reading their " anti-defamation " name title . 

use your mind and see how objective these people are . they have their own agenda ! 

i think , therefore i am .  one of the problems with popular culture , especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s , is that mass media - especially television - is usually about four years behind ' underground ' media , primarily music . many people think the ' woodstock generation " remained important throughout the 1970s ; actually , it was all over at altamont in 1970 . by 1972 , ' underground ' rock or the ' counterculture ' had moved east to england and led zepplin , black sabbath , and david bowie , early metal-heads and the so-called ' glam-rockers , ' who were all ' peace and love ' - not . neither , in a darkly different vein , was charles manson ' s ' family . ' 

this obvious pilot for a television show ( that , thankfully , was never picked up by the networks ) is attempting to come to terms with a culture that was already as withered as yesterday ' s flowers . the script must have been lying around a few years - by the time it was produced , writer carlino had already achieved recognition for tough mafia revenge tales . and the cultural references are all to " easy rider " and woodstock ( 1969 ) . the music referenced on the soundtrack is actually earlier , 1966 / 67 - at woodstock hendrix , canned heat , and sly and the family stone had blasted this kind of folk-pop into oblivion . 

the movie is about a middle-class family that goes on the road in order to meet hippies . wow , man , farout , outasight , it ' s a groovy mind-blowing happening of a bag . however , politics count for nothing - vietnam ? some place in asia , right ? 

this average ( meaning stale and vacuous ) tv movie is only redeemed by jeff bridges ' surprisingly mature performance as the young college drop-out who convinces his parents and grandma to ' discover ' ( hippie ) america . all the rest of the performances are standard tv fair by standard tv actors of the time . the director avails himself of some nice location cinematography , but otherwise the film is a poor way to spend 90 minutes . 

i knew it was all over when sal mineo remarks of a young runaway ( who tells the other characters they are not really there ) : " she ' s a latent existentialist . " wow , far out , groovy . 

a couple extra points for being ' so bad it ' s funny , ' but if you don ' t care about the ' 70 ' s tv version of the ' 60 ' s , stay away .  cheaply pieced together of recycled film footage , music and ideas , this film cannot really be called " well " . but for me , when i watched it as a teenager , it was quite amusing . ( i didn ' t know battle beyond the stars before . ) in retrospect it has got something nostalgic , regarding the sf wave of the early eighties and the special effects of this time . its trashy old-fashioned look and its naivety provide a certain attraction . to enjoy this movie i recommend to concentrate on the paternal relationship between the characters of vince edwards and david mendenhall . in addition , i liked the idea that a bunch of scoundrels discovers its heroic qualities after been unwillingly confronted with the challenge to take care of a child .  the story of macbeth was one of the most successful shakespeare ever wrote . this may be due to some features that place it close to the slasher genre , murder , murder , kill , kill , gallons of blood , a tense sexual relation between the main characters etc . more than this , the original play is very appealing taking into consideration the length ( it ' s only half the size of hamlet ) and the focus on macbeth for whom we are constrained to care in spite of his bloody nature . the play would seem ideal to base a movie on . not so lengthy it gives the directors the possibility to explore it ' s many levels , a good actor can play the role of his lifetime , the film has deep meaning in any historical period . unfortunately this has not been the case with macbeth . polanski ' s version comes quite close but it insists too much on the medieval period . welles ' film is too personal , with an interesting twist towards totalitarianism , the 1990 or so tv version is too shallow . this 2006 movie is no exception . it is very far from a shakespeare film , but it is interesting to see how the director understood the story and where he places it in contemporary life . no knights in shiny armor but gangsters in shiny cars . a lot of drugs and trippy music replace the dread of night in the original play . the idea of macbeth is so simple that to take and implant it in modern day life doesn ' t need shakespeare at all . the worst part in the film are the lines . most of the poignant scenes of the play , such as the dagger scene are trimmed so much they seem pointless . replacing the knocks in the door with doorbells and horses with cars seems funny . if they wanted to make a movie about power and its temptation they could have done it easily without shakespeare . this macbeth seems to be a looser with a brain injury not a valiant warrior , brave and ambitious that wants power so much he is prepared to to kill and who gets caught up in a net of fears and despair . the movie doesn ' t make clear what drives lady macbeth to madness , it doesn ' t give a reason why some of the characters should fear macbeth and his " terror " ( since there is no hereditary ascension to the throne , what with no throne and all ) and it places macbeth in an awkward position , since the leadership of a gang is as far from kingship as this whole movie is far from any shakespeare . in conclusion , we have two superimposed ideas that never quite meet making this a film that ' s ultimately pointless . . . . stand not upon the order of your going but go !  and now for another point of view : i didn ' t like it . i didn ' t finish it in fact . i know that " unforgiven " is ranked by some as one of the greatest westerns ever made . i know that it stars and was directed by clint eastwood , one of the icons of american cinema . i know that it won a bunch of oscars . still , i didn ' t like it . i don ' t like westerns , and that ' s clearly a matter of taste , but i also don ' t admire eastwood ' s acting . he is not and never has been a leading man . he is no burt lancaster , no paul newman , no john wayne . in this film alone he is dwarfed by richard harris and gene hackman ; they are both actors . no , eastwood is a tall guy with a reedy voice who usually plays tough guys . here he plays a retired tough guy . when i see him on screen , i see a man laboring at his acting . then there ' s the anti-western western plot . it is too obviously intended to inject contemporary values -- a respect for the role of women , blacks , native americans , and single parents ; a disrespect for violence and drinking ; the wholesomeness that comes with marriage , including interracial marriage , and small adorable children -- into a century in which those values weren ' t necessarily accepted , at least in these ways . by promoting those values , the movie comes across as mannered , if not preachy . then there are the hoary movie stereotypes -- prostitutes with hearts of gold , the kid who can ' t shoot straight , the city slicker new to the wild west , the sage brush shimmering on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in major chords . finally there is the pacing of eastwood ' s direction . i gave up after an hour . eastwood was still riding north , chatting with morgan freeman and the kid who couldn ' t shoot straight , sixty minutes after the plot driven by the slashing of a prostitute was set in motion . it was way too slow . somebody had to find these elements uncompelling . i am afraid it was me .  this movie is very disappointing for one who has read the book . as written by rafael sabatini , this was a clean cut tale of piracy in the caribbean , and it would have made a grand motion . also , it would have been very simple to make . all the action takes place aboard ship and on a deserted island . unfortunately , the screen writers took the title from sabatini then threw the rest of the book away . even the name of the main character was changed , and his screen personality was completely different from that of the individual described in the novel . it ' s a sad loss for one who loves a good sea story .  i rented this when it came out on video cassette in 1995 . after rewatching it again , my idea about it hasn ' t changed much . 

i was an adult then and i ' m still an adult now ! lol

the illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers didn ' t bother me . this isn ' t a documentary , it ' s a fantasy story where animals can talk ! 

while i didn ' t care for much of the songs , i liked the one at the end of the picture where it ' s sang by barry manilow and another person . 

some people seem to make an excuse for it ' s primitive animation by saying that cgi wasn ' t used often in animated features but let ' s not forget that the lion king was released about a year earlier and that packed possibly more excellence than any animated feature that came before it ! ! 

but i think it ' s pretty fair to say that the pebble and the pingoin was made on the cheap while the lion king wasn ' t . . . . 

the high points for me in 1995 as well as today is the suspense generated by the few dangerous ( mostly ) underwater chase scenes . 

i also liked the opening scene which takes place on a music notes page and a little bit of the love story . but most of the time , the story dragged on and was boring . 

worth a look if you like animation but if you ' re an adult and not a risk taker , go get another walt disney production instead of this !  ghost story has an interesting feminist revenge tale premise , a-list veteran actors , colorful flashbacks with nifty look-a-like youthful counterparts of the old men . scary staccato music heralding the approaching horrors , atmospheric new england winter weather , and an excellent charismatic actress in the title role . ghost story could have been much more effective in black and white and in eliminating some of the more lurid special effects , and to presenting a more cogent screenplay ( we should not have to be wondering about why the two trailer-parkish acolytes are in the script ) the biggest detriment of the film is craig wassan ( definitely separated at birth from bill maher ) who from perhaps editing or just bad acting , is totally ineffective . he seems to " specialize " in wide-eyed , wide-mouthed reaction shots ; not a lot of personality here . the revelation however is alice krige , pale-faced , enigmatic , terrifying underneath the placid exterior . however , her eva galli is creepy even before she meets her fate ; i mean , a young woman who says things like " i ' d like to take a bite out of you " or " dance with me , you little toad ! " is already not in the land of the living . ghost story would have been much better in a low-key , val lewton mode . the overdone special effects completely undercut the chill factor .  this film is a great disappointment . director vicente aranda has provided many interesting films throughout his long career , some of them were highlighted by strong and powerful performances by spanish actress victoria abril . in juana la loca , he relies on a gifted actress as well , newcomer pilar lopez de ayala , but this is barely the sole positive element in an otherwise terrible mess of a movie . while lopez de ayala tries hard to portray juana as a romantic and passionate young woman , completely obsessed by love to her handsome husband , it seems as if she weren ' t able to develop her character over this one-dimensional feature ; juana was an important figure in spanish history , and politics of that time were essential in her storyline . . . but here she ' s introduced as a romantic leading lady out of a soap opera ; this is a real pity , and the film a missing opportunity to show the way personal lives can influence history and vice versa . worst of all , italian actors daniele liotti and manuela arcuri turn out in real bad performances , which , in the case of liotti is a real problem as he portrays felipe el hermoso , a pivotal role in this story . it seems a clear choice to attract young audiences , as both of them look like top-models of this era . on the other hand , talented actors such as giuliano gemma and rosana pastor are completely wasted in supporting roles clearly underdeveloped . even if this was a big-budgeted film , little care was taken in bringing a good screenplay or creating " period pieces " on the screen . costumes are particularly grotesque in some of the group scenes , as if they were taken from stock material , without regarding of a real coherence . all in all , the main problem with juana la loca ( and this is what makes the difference with far superior historical films as la reine margot or elizabeth ) is the lack of a director ' s point of view . this a strange turn in aranda ' s career , as he was able to develop it in other works ( libertarias and amantes come to my mind ) , creating very personal and interesting movies , while this juana really is no more than a routine academic historical piece . . . and a not very good one at that !  even though he only made his debut film in australia and left for great britain and then america to continue his career , australians will tell you that the greatest film star they ever produced was errol flynn . i ' m not sure he ever even went back to australia after his breakout success in captain blood . still i attribute this film to the well known aussie irreverence for trashing the reputation of one of their own . 

part of the problem in telling errol flynn ' s life story was that he told enough tall tales in his life right up to the very end in his memoir , my wicked wicked ways . i could see that a lot of the film was based on that and upon reading between the lines of that book . 

his mother ' s infidelity to his father was not written , but could have been inferred in reading my wicked wicked ways . he didn ' t particularly like the woman , that is clear from a few sources . 

i wish the film had dealt more with his new guinea adventures , that to me was the most interesting part of my wicked wicked ways . as for his street fighting in the depression , i tend to disbelieve that . even if he had been successful at it , i guarantee that enough of that would have ruined his looks and he would never have had a career as a leading man . 

still the folks down under seem to think the atmosphere of sydney during the depression was captured well and guy pearce is a charismatic errol flynn . american audiences know him best as the uptight , but honest lieutenant exley in la confidential which came out the same year as flynn . 

but la confidential was a far better film .  perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of jane austen ' s works has been portrayed . perhaps i am too severe on this adaptation , but i ' m afraid i am biased to the a & e version . i have a hard time imagining mr . darcy portrayed by anyone other than colin firth . 

the characters seemed shallow , and often dialogue forced . lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book . her fancy for wickham was overplayed , and then her sudden like for darcy was not believable . 

darcy was portrayed tolerably well , i will grant him . he managed to maintain the aloofness that is required , but i felt he did not project the feeling and inner struggle that makes his character so delightful , especially in the proposal scene . 

mr . and mrs . bennet were also played well , but seemed lacking in many ways . the mean temper of mrs . bennet was not completely captured in her performance . 

mr . collins ' was a good portrayal . very much in line with the book . 

i will refrain from commenting on lady catherine except to say that she is possibly the worst portrayal in the entire film . 

other problems i saw were the few liberties they took with the order of events such as darcy being present at the first meeting with lady c . , and also that miss lucas and sir william did not join lizzy on her visit to the collins ' . 

the choreography was dreadful during the dancing scenes . the scene where lizzy and darcy dance loses much of its intensity because one cannot get past the feeling that they look akward on the ballroom floor . at least this bbc version left out the dialogue between lizzy , darcy and sir william when he commends the two on their dancing , as they performed very ill indeed . 

there were occasional moments that it kept me interested , but overall i find this version to be a disappointment . i would not advise this film unless you ' re like me , and you are excessively diverted by such follies . 

 although this series and the mini film in particular were very important at the time of release , i feel that the series as a whole was actually fairly poorly written with a weak cast . the issues at heart are extremely well portrayed yet it is difficult to relate and understand the problems within the film when the acting and script isn ' t convincing enough ( especially when looking at the mini film ) . 

i also don ' t believe that this mini film or series has stood the test of time as now many of the scenes are quite laughable . the issues are still crucial but boys from the blackstuff cannot fully aid the cause of understanding the problems in britain in the 1980s .  although not a big coen brothers fan , i am an admirer of their dark humor films like ' fargo ' and ' miller ' s crossing . ' i have been much less impressed by their other comic mode , goofy-camp ( or is that camp goofy ? ) unfortunately , ' o brother , where art thou ? ' falls into the latter category and isn ' t even as good as ' the big lebowski ' or ' the hudsucker proxy . ' 

 ' o brother ' is basically an episodic series of in-jokes without much point , and not all that much humor or cleverness either . as most reviewers have noted , the film ' s plot is very loosely Â and , as far as i could tell , quite arbitrarily Â based on the odyssey . its main character , ulysses everett mcgill ( george clooney ) , is an ' adventurer ' like his homeric namesake and has as his ' real ' goal the return home to prevent the marriage of his wife penny to a suitor . of course , we don ' t discover that this is what the clooney / ulysses character really wants until long after we ' ve stopped caring . and what does homer have to do with " cool hand luke " chain gangs , ku klux klan meetings a la " indiana jones " cult gatherings , a disbarred lawyer ' s vocabulary , a talent for blue-grass country music singing , an association with baby face nelson , a clark gable lookalike hairdo , and other random and sundry character traits and encounters ? i leave that for others to discern . 

the allusion to preston sturges ' ' sullivan ' s travels ' in ' o brother ' s ' title is equally pointless . yes , viewers familiar with the sturges minor screwball comedy classic might find it mildly rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious depression movie sullivan abandons hollywood and comedy hoping to make . and they might even be mildly amused by a couple of shot / scene riffs ( e . g . hopping freight cars , and the chain gang shuffle into view a movie ) . but so what ? the coen brothers don ' t seem to have anything to add to the art-for-art ' s-sake versus moral high seriousness critical debate about the function of art . they obviously fall into the former school , but that doesn ' t seem to motivate the reference in the slightest . is it an homage ? if so , why make it ? i like post-modern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person , but it ' s a lot nicer when it amounts to something at least tonally , if not thematically , consistent Â and not just an arbitrary concoction . 

this screenplay is simply a silly mess . the only consistent , and consistently pleasing , element is the folk / country music soundtrack . it doesn ' t have much to do with homer or preston sturges , but , considering the rest of the film , that ' s probably a good thing . on the other hand , i ' d recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack cd .  i enjoyed the beautiful scenery in this movie the first time i saw it when i was 9 . dunderklumpen is kind of cute for kiddies in a corny way . it reminded me of hrpuffinstuff on sat mornings , its swedish backdrops make it easy on the eyes . don ' t expect older kids to be interested as the live action / animation is way behind the times and most older kids will get bored . this is definitely an under 10 age set movie and a nice bit of memories for those of us who were little kids in 1974 .  this is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film . billy dee plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into his own hands . it ' s fairly gritty and realistic without exploiting the characters but still it ' s not that interesting either and billy dee ' s character , though maltreated by white authority figures , doesn ' t really come off as sympathetic . it ' s also hurt by it ' s extremely low budget . still , it ' s interesting to look at as it ' s a good depicttion of 1970s social issues .  a previous imdb reviewer has stated that ' rafter romance ' is a ' rip-off ' ( that ' s the other reviewer ' s term ) of a german musical called ' me by day , you by night ' . apparently that reviewer is unaware that * both * of these films have borrowed their premise from ' box and cox ' , an english play written by john maddison morton in 1847 . this play deals with two tradesmen who rent the same room from an unscrupulous landlady , each man believing himself the sole tenant . because the two men have different work schedules , the ruse is not discovered straight away . this play was once so popular in britain that ' to box and cox it ' became a common term for an arrangement in which two people willingly shared accommodations meant for only one person . 

the innovation of ' rafter romance ' ( and its predecessor ) is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman , who inevitably develop a romance . as is usual in these cornball movies , the guy and the gal detest each other until they fall into each other ' s arms . hoo boy . 

the landlord in this film is played by george sidney , a character actor who specialised in playing jewish stereotypes that were meant to be sympathetic . george sidney was never as annoying as the odious harry green ( the jewish equivalent of stepin fetchit ) but sidney ' s depictions of jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing to watch . 

the single most notable thing about ' rafter romance ' is that , to my knowledge , this is the earliest hollywood film to make reference to hitler and the rise of nazism . at one point in this movie , landlord eckbaum ( sidney ) discovers his teenage son julius engaged in chalking swastikas on the walls . eckbaum and his son are clearly meant to be jewish . admittedly , nobody in hollywood in 1933 had any real idea of what hitler was planning for the jews in europe . . . still , it ' s surprising to see a film depicting a jewish teenager who thinks that swastikas are a joke . his father is , quite properly , angered by this display of the nazi symbol . 

a very shameful aspect of hollywood history is the documented fact that all of the major hollywood studios continued to do business with the third reich as late as 1939 . hollywood ' s leading ladies were medically documented as ' aryan ' so that their films could be distributed in nazi germany and austria . for the same reason , hollywood ' s leading men were documented as ' aryan and uncircumcised ' . except for darryl zanuck at twentieth century-fox , all the hollywood studio executives who colluded in this policy were jewish . . . but clearly had no objection to doing business with hitler . i ' m surprised that ' rafter romance ' contains a scene depicting swastikas unfavourably , as this sequence would have rendered the film verboten in germany and austria . ( maybe the scene was cut out for german release : it isn ' t crucial to the movie ' s plot . ) apart from this , the movie contains nothing notable . robert benchley does his usual unfunny befuddled characterisation : i ' ve never understood the appeal of this man . i ' ll rate ' rafter romance ' 4 out of 10 .  this movie states through its protagonist that the world is essentially sadness and pain and those that ignore this have blinders on . one can argue whether this is true or not . but even if you accept this as true , the movie ' s ending either a ) disputes this by saying there can be some good in tragic situations or b ) forgets this and uses a cliched montage in order to leave the audience feeling uplifted . 

that the movie metaphorically acquits its protagonist by presenting him as a sympathetic character despite any evidence for that sympathy shows contempt for the supporting characters who were the most compelling in the film . 

so what you have in this film is a script that is not consistent in its theme and direction that does not bring the ending into sync with the rest of the film . there are excellent performances given by every member of the cast especially spacey , olin , martin donovan , and ann magnuson . it ' s a shame that they weren ' t supported by a better writer / director .  anna christie ( greta garbo ) returns to see her father chris ( george f marion ) after 15 years . he is the skipper of a boat and she stays to travel with him . during this time , she meets matt ( charles bickford ) and they fall in love . matt and chris don ' t see eye to eye and anna has a secret to confess . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

what a boring story . . . . . . it starts badly with george f marion and marie dressler playing drunks in a bar . the scene goes on forever and they are both terrible . its also hard to understand them . in fact , its difficult to understand the whole cast . i missed whole sections of dialogue between bickford , marion and garbo because it is incomprehensible ! garbo is obviously something special as you are drawn to her every time that she is on screen and her presence gives this film the 4 stars that i have given to it . but nothing really happens - its a boring story with atrocious accents . you ' ll do well to stay awake .  i haven ' t seen any other films by antonioni and the people that saw this one with me agreed that it shares themes and imagery with the rest of his works . maybe if i had seen other stuff by him i would have enjoyed this one , knowing what to expect . 

i saw it as an almost complete failure for so many reasons . first of all , the film introduces interesting , deep issues about social relationships , feelings , the nature of reality versus fiction , but this is very often done in the clumsiest of ways making the characters speak as if they were delivering speeches , rambling on and on , juxtaposing declarations rather than having dialogues . the scriptwriters seem to be so worried that we will not get the point that they prefer to tell instead of showing . 

secondly , the movie has no rhythm , especially in its first half . it is not only that it is slow . some slow films have been made with an excellent sense of pace and rhythm ( el sur by victor erice or scorsese ' s the age of innocence are examples i like ) , but for that to be successful it is necessary that we find the characters so engaging or the story so moving that we can adapt to it . this does not happen in beyond the clouds , where the first episode seems to drag endlessly , and the relationship between john malkovich ' s " reality " and the love stories " fiction " is at times fluid , others abrupt , others confusing .  how could they take such a beautifully animated gem like don bluth ' s all dogs go to heaven and bastardize it with a charmless , cheesy , uninspired sequel . the haunting music and delightful characters are gone , now replaced with tacky animation and an unimaginative plot . 

the pros : charlie sheen is sometimes fun as charlie , but he lacks the charming tough guy attitude that brought him to life by burt reynolds . i did particularly enjoy the songs " i will always be with you " and " it ' s too heavenly here " . 

the cons : there seems to be no connection between this and the original . in the beginning charlie is chums with carface , but wait a minute . isn ' t this the same character who was responsible for charlie ' s murder and kidnapped the sweet little orphan he loved ? i guess that all changes in heaven but why isn ' t anne-marie even mentioned ? if itchy makes it to heaven , wouldn ' t flo and killer make it too ? what is with annabelle the whippet ' s voice ? in the original it sounded feminine and charming and in the sequel it sounds like a whiny , bitchy , parrot . the new characters aren ' t all that great ( except sasha ) . and the animation is better compared to a generic saturday morning cartoon . the constant cartoony " humor " is flat and unfunny and the " heart " just doesn ' t work when compare to the original , which had such a moving unsubtle touch that makes me cry every time . 

all dogs go to heaven is one of my all-time favorite films . how don bluth allowed this sequel to be made is beyond me . 

bottom line : not all sequels go to heaven .  oddball black-comedy romance featuring a great cast and a less than stellar script . brenda blethyn ( " lovely & amazing " ) is the title character ' betty ' , a woman trapped in a loveless marriage with a man who is obviously having an affair with his beautiful , blonde secretary . guess who ' s playing this minor role , yup ! naomi watts ( " mulholland drive " ) must of sandwiched this project in before her superstar status was insured with the blockbuster thriller " the ring . " 

on the male side of the cast list there ' s the woefully miscast alfred molina ( " frida " ) an old-fashioned undertaker who suddenly decides to reveal his desires for ' betty ' which have lain dormant for decades . perhaps miramax is hoping molina ' s turn in the upcoming " spider-man 2 " might generate some interest in this little trinket which belongs on the dvd rental shelf . 

but the award for wildest thankless performance goes to christopher walken ( " catch me if you can " ) who goes completely over the top as ' modern ' undertaker with his vegas-style funerals in a small provincial town . his character must have parachuted into the village because there ' s little reason for him to exist in this script . 

that said , if you ' d like to see some top-notch actors engage in some low-brow humor then this one ' s for you , and if this isn ' t your cup-of-tea then try renting " harold and maude , " the ultimate funeral movie that ' s still funny to this day .  it has a bit of that indie queer edge that was hip in the 90s and which places an explicit sell-by date on the visual style . characters are uniformly apathetic and farcically deadpan . street hoodlums in greece wear new clothing out of the box without creases or stains . they all appear to visit the same marine hair dresser . all uniformly exhibit the same low iq when making their dispassionate underground business deals . when things go wrong its all because they aren ' t real greeks - they ' re pastoral sunshine boys caught in a strange night city world . makes a big whine about disaffected immigrants but never bothers to actually investigate the problems with russian / kazakh / albanian cultures . if giannaris had the proper perspective on this project it might have made a wonderful bel ami production . the fleeting glimpses of toned boy-beef is the only spark in this generic small-time mobster programmer .  back in 1995 , barry sonnenfeld directed a movie that ended up on many critics best of lists by the time the year ' s recaps were being printed in entertainment publications . the movie was get shorty and it gave lead star john travolta his second big hit in as many years after pulp fiction put him back in front of the paparazzi ' s lenses . based on a novel by elmore leonard , the film focused on wise guy chili palmer ( travolta ) and his attempts to break into the movie business . i , for one , was completely captured by the diverse characters and crisp dialogue of the original . so much so , that when i heard there was going to be a sequel , i seemed to forgo my usual shivering that occurs when a studio tries to rehash what was a good idea over ten years later . the sequel , also based on a novel by leonard , is this time directed by f . gary gray who ' s italian job in 2003 was one of the years highest grossing films . couple that with the cast now expanding to include uma thurman , harvey keitel , cedric the entertainer , the rock , vince vaughn and james woods and you have all the makings of a great continuance in the exploits of one of the more interesting characters of the 1990 ' s . this time round we pick up as chili ( travolta ) is leaving the movie business after being disappointed in both himself and the industry for participating in the making of a sequel to his successful first film . thanks in small part to his friend , tommy athens ( woods ) and the misfortune of his death , chili decides to look into the lucrative and dangerous music industry . this first leads to the famous viper club where chili meets singing sensation linda moon ( christina milian ) who as lead of an upstart trio , can belt out tunes like whitney houston ( that is , the whitney before bobby brown started bringing home the small packages of sugar ) . linda is under contract with raji ( vaughn ) who , with his overly apparent gay bodyguard elliot wilhelm ( the rock ) , plan to ensure linda fulfills the final five years of her contract even if that means putting chili on ice . so with linda ' s future in the balance , chili weaves an interesting web which will include a record producer ( thurman ) , a gangsta sound mixer ( cedric ) , the russian mob , the police , aerosmith ' s lead singer steven tyler and a whole lot of angry gun pointing . woo-wheee ! that sounds exciting . so why wasn ' t it ? be cool tries too hard to , well , be cool . but the result is a film that unlike the original , has no heart and no soul . be cool feels instead like it was directed by a saturday night live producer as there are individual scenes or skits that don ' t string together over a whole movie . take for example the scene where travolta and thurman dance together for the first time since pulp fiction , as black eyed peas performs live in the background . the scene is forced and should have ended up on the cutting room floor . instead , it is coupled between two other needless chapters that do nothing to push the story forwards with any real thrust . the aerosmith concert , and the rock ' s trip to a boot shop are also prime examples of individual moments that don ' t amount to much of a movie when put together . but those aren ' t the only issues with the sequel - which could probably be renamed product placement with the amount of 2-ways and diet pepsi ' s that seem to stare at you more intensely than chili ' s serious look . the story contains just about every stereotype imaginable and each one has just enough screen time to become slightly offensive or embarrassing . whether it is the gangsta entourage or the gay muscle guy that has a movie poster of sylvester stallone ' s rhinestone on the wall , no characters is above offering us anything we haven ' t seen many times before and in much better films . with the magic all but gone from the first film , we end up with an inferior product that is the second film in the past six months ( ocean ' s 13 being the other ) that cram a bunch of stars onto a marquee only to end up as a movie that no actor would bring to an open audition . be cool was a major disappointment . i so wanted it to be the get shorty of the new millennium and i ended up with a film where the outtakes must have been a gas , but experience left me with a stinker .  dean koontz ' s book " watchers " is one of the finest books i have read . sadly , the movie is a sad caricature of the book . the disillusioned middle-aged hero and the lonely spinster with whom he finds a meaning to his life are converted in the movie into a couple of silly teenagers , the stoic security agent and the conscientious sheriff are combined into a farcical villain - you get the picture ? the moviemakers have taken a moving tale of love , horror and adventure and converted it into a z-grade horror flick aimed - very poorly - at the teen market . 

buy the book and enjoy many hours of reading - it will be far , far more rewarding than watching the movie . 

 i like cky and viva la bam , so i couldn ' t resist this when i saw it for Â£1 . 99 in gamestation . it is bam magera ' s debut scripted film , penned by himself and brandon dicimaillo , and stars the entire cky crew ( ryan dunn , raab himself , rake yohn , jenn rivell , don vito etc etc ) . brandon also is in charge of the artistic direction - which is one of the film ' s greatest merits - its quite ckyish in its colour style - but also shows progression . 

basically it follows ( very loosely ) ryan dunn ' s break up with girlfriend glauren ( played by jenn ) . vilo ( played by bam , named after vilo valo by any chance ? ) and falcone ( bran ) play his best mates who reek havoc by doing various stunts . 

its a bit like the cky films but with a linear storyline ( which is very basic indeed ) and poor acting . its strange , the usually super charsmatic gang seem to have the life sucked out of them when they know what their meant to say next . 

the acting and script is pretty appalling for the most part , but the second half of the film is much better than the first ( 90 mins is a stretch for the flick though ) , and there are a number of redeeming factors , such as tony hawk ' s cameo , dicimaillo ' s sub plots such as ' the futurstic invention awards ' and ' the diamond bike ' , the soundtrack is also very strong ( its not all cky and him - in fact bomfunk mc ' s steal the film in terms of its use of music ) . in the second half of the film the sense of fun is much more real - especially since don vito has a fairly prominent role in the latter part - and he seems to steal every scene he is in . 

the film will appeal to those who like the cky antics , but only because of the core material and not the filler or story line bullshit . oh , and will someone tell bam that skating montages , especially in films , is sooo 1998 . 

however , the best part of the package on the dvd is not the film - but the 40 mins ' making of ' doc . 

the last 20 minutes of the documentary deal with raab himself ' s alcholism and the crew ' s real feelings towards each other amazing candidly ( as usual bam comes across as a bit of a dick , especially towards raab ' s drink problem and ryan dunn comes across as a really nice down to earth guy ) . the last ten mins of the documentary deal with a friend ( who is an infrequent cky member ) trying to kick heroin whilst staying at the magera household with the crew - and a caring unitary side of gang ( espcially ape and ryan ) really comes across - a startling gem in an otherwise dull dvd . 

for Â£1 . 99 i ' m very satisified - although i hope bam stays to the improvised and short skits from now on .  strikes me as routine , as far as tv movies go . i can believe that it ' s based on a true story because the plot seems too clumsy to have been written by anyone with storytelling skills . 

for instance , good old john ritter ( now a rather bulky and bearded villain ) poisons his wife enough to make her ill , then accuses her of being psychosomatic and leaves to marry another young woman immediately . fourteen years pass before the story picks up again . why fourteen years ? i would guess that though the narrative doesn ' t demand it , history does . 

some of the particular scenes , however , are so cinematically apt that they were almost certainly dreamed up by a writer . pawing through her attic , helgenberger , ritter ' s first wife , stumbles across an old electrical appliance and has one of those black-and-white flashbacks with stings on the score -- suddenly she recalls when , fourteen years ago , she discovered ritter shaving selenium filings from a rectifier , carefully collecting them , and putting them in her shampoo and her eyelash liner ( or whatever it ' s called ) . later it develops that he was putting it into her coffee as well . 

frankly , i don ' t believe it . i don ' t believe either that she had that particular epiphany in the attic or that ritter put selenium shavings into her shampoo or eyeliner . selenium is referred to in the movie as a " toxic metal " and i suppose it is , in sufficient quantity , but it ' s also an anti-oxidant that ' s sold over the counter in drug stores and swallowed . someone will have to demonstrate -- as no one does in this movie -- that it is a topical poison . many people have tried the nicotine patch and failed . so how come some selenium in her shampoo gives marg helgenberger immediate and drastic headaches ? and her eyes become as painful as boils when she applies makeup ? i think the anthropologist e . b . tylor called this simple-minded idea " sympathetic magic , " but i ' m not sure . 

mais je divage . anyway ritter evidently tries the same stunt with his second wife fourteen years later , although no evidence of trickery is ever produced when she becomes ill with the same symptoms . wife number two is taken to mexico and apparently cured but suddenly drops dead shortly after her return . circumstantial evidence piles up against ritter , who plays the villain with all the stops out -- when his first trial is dismissed he smirks at helgenberger , who has prompted the investigation . 

you see , helgenberger was good friends with ritter ' s second wife and was terribly disturbed at her demise and its manner . ( i ' ll bet . ) and she wants to prevent the same thing from happening to the wealthy young woman who seems lined up for third place in ritter ' s marital schedule . ( sure . ) the best performance is given by the guy who plays detective mauser -- lawrence dane ? everyone else acts by the numbers . they project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning at a railroad crossing . but dane does little things that are original . " i ' m told you want to report a murder . ( long pause while he sits down and waits ) , then abruptly thrusts his face towards helgeberger and inquires in a reasonable and curious voice , " so who was murdered " ? i suppose except for the bare bones of the historical events , nothing prevented characters or their actions from being drawn differently than they were in real life . i mean , what the heck , ritter is still in jail convicted of murder and helgenberger ' s character is dead , so who is to object ? i wish the forensic stuff had been made clearer . ritter seems to have used so many poisons and toxic metals -- let me see , selenium , cyanide , a massive dose of chlorine , and maybe something else -- that i was confused by it all . not that i was rooting for ritter . here ' s a mathematician with a ph . d . who insists people call him " doctor . " he even corrects people who address him merely as " professor . " most ph . d . s get that narcissistic problem behind them very quickly . " jes ' call me whitey , even though i know how to get a standard deviation and you don ' t . " average tv fare .  hedy lamarr who may have been kept by more men on screen than any other actress , is again the kept mistress of kent taylor , society playboy and general all around rat . on a boat from the yucatan after taylor ' s given her the brush she tries suicide . but doctor spencer tracy saves her from drowning in the caribbean . 

tracy ' s quite the all around medical fellow . i guess he never heard the word specialist . he runs a clinic in manhattan for the poor and his trip was a sideline into medical research . lamarr and he marry and she tries to introduce him into her world and he even becomes a partner of society doctor louis calhern . of course kent taylor reenters the picture and the hollywood inevitable happens . 

watching i take this woman it seemed to me that the writers were very much influenced by tracy ' s oscar winning boys town . unfortunately his role as doctor karl decker ain ' t a patch on what he did as father flanagan . maybe they were trying to give father flanagan a little romance in his life in this film so to speak . 

tracy and lamarr did not get along too well . in fact this film was dubbed i retake this woman because the original director joseph von sternberg walked off the film , presumably because lamarr was not working out for him the way marlene dietrich did . she did lady of the tropics and then mgm went back to filming this with their contract director woody van dyke who was known for the speed of his productions . and a whole new supporting cast was brought in . 

fortunately both spence and hedy had better roles in store for both of them .  i watched " deadly voyage " because david suchet was in it , after enjoying him in the " poirot " series . and joss ackland is always worth watching , so i went into the film with an expectation of it being a potentially worthwhile film . alas , it was not to be . 

i won ' t bother critiquing the performances , the pacing , the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film ; others here have already given their opinions on those elements . the only thing i want to address is the film ' s message , since it proclaims in the intro that it ' s based upon a true story , and therein hangs the film ' s supposed importance . 

 " deadly voyage " primarily focuses upon an impoverished black african man named kingsley who wants to move to the us , because he believes that he can make money there . nothing more , nothing less -- his motivation is utterly selfish . ( of course some people will prevaricate by saying that he was doing it for his family , but in fact he decided to have children on the income he could make in ghana , so he really just created his own problem . ) to that end , kingsley decides to stow-away aboard a russian freighter bound for new york . in the process of doing this , he faces harsh conditions , racist crew members and other challenges . 

but this is precisely where the film leaves me unsympathetic . why should the audience be expected to care about kingsley ? simply because he has a goal ? goals aren ' t such a rare commodity that his should be privileged above say , the goal of the ship ' s captain or the woman he left at home with his newborn child . kingsley ' s goal is illegal in the eyes of the us government . it is also illegal in that it steals from the russian shipping company . if he makes it to the us , it would involve taking out of a system that he has not put into . and if he gets caught , the shipping company will be fined $ 45 , 000 . i doubt very much that any of the stowaways care about what their chosen course of action is costing anyone else ; they ' re clearly just out for their own gain . he could ' ve spent the $ 1 , 000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film , for legal passage to the us , and applied for residency and a work permit . instead , he takes the illegal ( and dangerous ) route . 

so since kingsley ' s voyage is illegal , selfish and cannot be ethically justified , why should we care about him or his ordeal ? simply because he faces challenges ? why should his challenges be privileged above the challenge of the russian shipping company getting to new york without stowaways ? because he ' s black and the shipping company is white ? the reason seems to be because danny glover ( the film ' s executive producer ) and others involved want us to root for kingsley , as if he ' s a hero on some sort of noble voyage . but once you accept that illegal immigration , theft and a fool ' s mission aren ' t noble at all , you can ' t really care about him . 

before anyone plays the race card , i assure you that i would ' ve felt the same no matter what ethnicity / nationality the involved parties were . imagine if a british person decided to stow-away in a train headed for bhutan , sneak across the border , and collect " unwanted " buddhist antiquities , to bring back to britain to sell . how much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate ? very little , i ' d bet . so why should we feel different for kingley ? because he ' s black ? because he ' s poor by american standards ? the filmmakers are banking on us sharing their views that the ends justify the means , and that a shipping company being fined $ 45 , 000 is inconsequential compared to the remote possibility of an unskilled laborer earning slightly more in the us than he could ' ve if he had just stayed in his own home country . i didn ' t buy it for a minute .  the only reason i watched this movie a second time , was to learn the name of the " second banana " girl playing opposite katie holms . her name is marisa coughlan . never heard of her before . she is lovely . captivating . with an animated face , and cute bod , she is highly watchable . . . she ' s got real , " poisenality " . . . more than a passing vibe of grace kelly . . . with youthful exuberance . i think she is irish in gene pool , ( my favorite female dna ) so it makes some sense that she would resemble the most beautiful irish american . the movie is unremarkable , katie holms is classic beauty in the flesh . but marisa coughlan is the one you follow with your eyes . in 1999 when this movie was made , she was around 25 years old , in her prime . this reminds me of another silly , worthless movie with the only redemption being the pretty girl in it . it was " career opportunites " with the first time i saw jennifer conoly . or " grease ii " the first time i saw michelle pfeiffer .  i was fairly lost throughout most of this film , and i am the one who usually understands the works of such enigmatic cinema greats as david lynch ( twin peaks : fire walk with me ) and darren aronofsky ( pi ) . not to say that northfork doesn ' t make sense on some level , it just doesn ' t combine to form a wholly coherent film . as time passes from watching the film , its themes and intentions become clearer , but during my initial viewing , i was really confounded , and i find that this is the major fault of the film . . . its lack of direction . the plot centers on the town of northfork , montana in the year 1955 . the town has been emptied and will soon be flooded to make way for the creation of a hydro-electric dam . the major problem is that not all of its inhabitants are willing to be evacuated and relocated . a group of men are hired to coerce the remaining residents out of the town before it will be drowned , and for the most part they succeed amidst some fairly odd situations and townspeople . simultaneously , the film tells the story of irwin , a very sick young boy ( or is he a fallen angel ? ) whose adopted parents gave him back , due to his illness , to the northfork orphanage that they adopted him from . father harlan ( nick nolte ) cares for the dying irwin , but irwin imagines ( or does he ? ! ) that a group of angels ( including daryl hannah and anthony edwards ) have arrived in the desolate and empty town looking for a fallen angel . irwin has scars on his back and on his head , and he tries to convince the angels that his scars are where the humans amputated his wings and halo . oh yeah , and during all of this there is a strangely surreal walking animal on stilts that roams throughout the backdrop of the landscape . there are a lot of other small events that happen in the film , but none of them end up amounting to much more than momentary intrigue . one can appreciate the artistic quality of the film ( it ' s obvious that the filmmakers cared deeply about this film ) and its rich cinematography , but the film still tries too hard to be different and then gives up and whimpers to an end without making much of a statement . like i wrote earlier , it becomes clearer , long after viewing , what has possibly taken place in the film . irwin is dying , and so is northfork , and in coping with his own loss and death , irwin has most likely created characters , from ideas he gets from the objects that surround him at the orphanage , to console him as he is abandoned and his life nears its end . but then again , maybe he really is an angel , and he has found his kind and can now return home . i must emphasize that there are some truly beautiful moments in the film , heartbreaking , vivid and full of loneliness and sadness . unfortunately , the film as a whole just ends up feeling disconnected and somehow incomplete .  this film should have been much better than it was . christopher eccleston is an excellent actor but even he couldn ' t rescue this tale of a young woman searching for the truth over her sister ' s death . spoiler warning : in effect the truth is that the older sister ( played by diaz ) is just a spoilt , selfish and shallow girl who took too many drugs . not much of a twist and not that interesting either . the film is also overladen with far too many flashbacks and voice overs and lacks dramatic pacing . all in all this is definitely worth missing - not to be recommended .  well , this was my first imax experience so i was pretty blown away about that , primarily ; although with hindsight , i can ' t help wishing that it had been some other ( less monochrome ) film . 

magnificent desolation very much had the " programme for schools " feel the way it listed all the astronauts and this made it feel a lot like reading national geographic magazine in 3d . weirdly it actually had a very two dimensional quality that only occasionally exploded into reality and a lot of time it felt like some powerpoint presentation . there was a moment in the film when an unnoticed abyss opens ; seemingly at your feel , that had a bit of a wow factor but to be honest , that may have had more to do with me being an imax virgin . 

the commentary , provided by tom hanks , i personally found very , ( what ' s a nice way to put it ? ? ) " flag-wavingly nationalistic " which didn ' t go down too well in central london , judging by remarks overheard as we left . 

over all , i loved the imax experience , but dearly wish a different film had been on on that day . the moon isn ' t a particularly colourful subject and to be honest , a lot of the 3d effects were lost in the monochrome scenery . all that would have been well , were it not for the documentary inserts and distractions like the interviews with american schoolchildren which spoiled it a bit i saw this film while i was in france and i must say that it confused me . it is a story of a jewel thief and a young singer who each end up in morocco at the same time , run into one another and form a connection . simple enough ? well , the problem is that this is the sort of film that has ambiguity in both chronology ( the film is not played entirely in order ) and in reality ( did what i just saw really happen , or was it only a dream ? ) . given those parameters , as well as the film being bilingual , it was really hard to follow , and i was not sure as to what happened at the end . i imagine some deep artsy types could understand this film better than i could , and it may require more than one viewing to understand .  the film is visually stunning : from the dusty interior of the church with the lighted stove , through the drizzly street and the run-down garage to the blaze that is the climax of the film . it also has a wonderful sense of time , both 1950 ' s ( the film ' s opening ) and 1960 ' s . all of the performances are top-class , especially mathew macfadyen as the psychotic preacher and gerard mcsorley as the father who finds his own intolerance terrifyingly magnified by his son . what a pity , then , that the story is so ridiculous . for a start , in concentrating on the relationship between gabriel ( mcfadyen ) and his family , it utterly fails to show how he has managed to hold so much influence on the community . in the church , we see five or six of the main characters at the front , and another two or three at the back , but the rest of the congregation might as well be mannequins : they show no sign of hearing him , heeding him or dissenting from him ; at the cockfight , nobody says yea or nay when he disrupts the proceedings , but neither does anybody applaud or condemn when caroline throws a pint over him ; a situation that results in a stone thrown through the pub window is mysteriously resolved by the onset of labour pains . secondly , middletown ( which isn ' t actually a town , but a tiny village ) seems to lack some essential services , such as police and fire service : murder can only be dealt with by a family member with a crowbar ; residents watch an inferno that threatens to engulf the whole town as though they were at the cinema . for that matter , everyday things such as telephones and newspapers are conspicuously absent , the rural community is strangely devoid of farm animals or wheat-fields , and most puzzling of all for a ' typical ' north of ireland setting , there is only one christian community - not even a couple of anglicans to season the mix . even if you ' re willing to suspend disbelief , the story itself is pretty threadbare , a pale imitation of an a . j . cronin melodrama . and the music ? well , it ' s beautiful for the first two minutes , but when the same four chords are repeated non-stop for 90 minutes it gets more than a little irritating . my advice : watch this with the sound off .  the lives of megan ( jackie kresler ) and dylan ( shane elliott ) change in the nevada desert between reno and las vegas . they stop to eat at a small greasy spoon where they reluctantly learn about the infamous area 51 by the cafÃ© proprietor ( jonathan breck ) . after getting back on the road in their forty year old lincoln , the radio gets a little crazy broadcasting hitler ' s speech at the 1836 olympics and then later a 1958 news bulletin of elvis presley being drafted into the military . the car slowly breaks down and the two are in for the scare of their lives as mysterious unexplainable things happen in the lonely radiation-poisoned desert ; remnants of nuclear testing . megan meets a lost little girl ( channing nichols ) and a wounded wwii soldier . the nightmarish journey doesn ' t end there . kresler is impressive to a degree and writer / director james lay makes good use of patsy cline tunes . all in all , moderately interesting sci-fi .  saimin

following a series of bizarre and apparently unrelated ' suicides ' , an experienced tokyo detective ( ken utsui ) enlists the help of a young psychoanalyst ( goro inagaki ) who believes the victims were acting on a post-hypnotic suggestion . but their subsequent investigations reveal an even darker force at work , linked to a young girl ( miho kanno ) whose life has been blighted by sadistic abuse . . . 

based on a novel by keisuke matsuoka , this densely-plotted mystery takes inspiration from a variety of sources ( italian gialli , traditional japanese ghost stories , etc . ) , though some of the images in the climactic showdown reveal a more immediate influence : the recent commercial success of hideo nakata ' s ring ( 1998 ) . for all its ambition , however , saimin is a routine potboiler which stumbles badly after a powerhouse opening ( the ' suicides ' are particularly impressive , despite some feeble cgi effects ) , though director masayuki ochiai - who co-wrote the script with yasushi fukuda - rallies proceedings for an extended finale in which the narrative ' s startling secrets are finally revealed . ochiai is best known for his film adaptation of novel-turned-video-game parasite eve ( 1997 ) - which also starred leading man inagaki ( a member of japanese pop group smap ) - and while saimin echoes that movie ' s strong visual sense , it falls short as drama , and most of the characters are mere ciphers , undermining the storyline ' s emotional pay-off . which is a shame , because the final half hour is galvanized by a series of dynamic set-pieces - most notably , a concert hall sequence in which dvorak ' s ' new world ' symphony is transformed into an instrument of murder ! - and ochiai is well-served by an excellent production team . however , those lured by the promise of gory carnage may be disappointed - the film is long on atmospherics and short on splatter . 

performances are varied , due to the script ' s limitations , but kanno ( tomie ) is outstanding as a young woman suffering from multiple personality disorder - which , the subtitles on the print under review assures us , isn ' t recognized as a viable medical condition in japan ! - who falls prey to a sleazy tv hypnotist ( takeshi masu ) , a prime suspect in the murders . inagaki is bland in a one-dimensional role , and he ' s constantly upstaged by utsui , a veteran performer whose career stretches back to the " sÃ»pÃ¢ jaiantsu " series of the 1950 ' s . 

 ( japanese dialogue )  i ' ve read all the complimentary posts on this muddled semi-noir and am puzzled at the high regard for what seems , in the cruel light of 2007 , a very sloppy late-rko assembly-line product . all that endless documentary footage of fish , waves , fish , waves has little to do with the central conflict and just pads the running time . the editing is downright careless : scenes just end , and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them . the dialog bears the stilted traces of the odets origins : high-flown metaphors that never could have come from the limited imaginations of these workaday people . but what ' s really surprising is how horribly overacted the triangle is , on all sides . i love stanwyck , but she snarls and contorts and lashes out wildly -- an undisciplined performance several notches below her standard . douglas , overplaying at being lovable , then goes onto a would-be murderous rampage and is similarly hammy , as is ryan , snarling and shouting most unnaturally . the less interesting second couple at least provides recognizable human behavior : keith andes , whose character is kind of a neanderthal by today ' s standards , nevertheless is smooth and persuasive as stanwyck ' s ( much younger , one presumes ) brother , and marilyn monroe , as his girlfriend , is natural and unaffected . on monterey ' s windswept coast ( and all that monterey footage , while largely irrelevant , is interesting as a document of what the town looked like ) , amid all the overheated hysteria , these two are islands of sanity . a final point , and a spoiler : perhaps the breen office mandated it , but does anybody believe the happy ending for a second ? stanwyck may temporarily have regressed into being an obedient wifey , but i give the marriage a month .  the lavish production values that you generally find in a merchant / ivory film are all here , but this is an exceedingly dull take on what could have been a very lively affair . i agree with an earlier poster that it makes no sense for the story to be unfolding through the eyes of an african american family and yet their own ancestor , sally hemmings , has barely a role to play in the proceedings . there is not much clarity to be found in helping the audience understand the motivations of any of these historical figures . and i was very bothered by the accents of a number of the characters . nancy marchand sounded very british for what one assumes is a french nun . and both gwyneth paltrow and greta scacchi seemed to be trying out different accents in various scenes . in fact , gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic . her role as thomas jefferson ' s daughter , martha , is written in such a manner that we never get a handle on who she really is . one moment she is slapping a slave , and another moment , she ' s deploring the whole system of slavery . nick nolte performs the role well enough but doesn ' t ever make us truly care for jefferson or any of his exploits . very disappointing all in all .  it is high time that american critics and fans alike start to debunk their unquestioned , sloppy veneration of films like sergio leone ' s ' once upon a time in america ' . the checkered history of this opulent film ( and the grand , fanciful myth associated with it ' s production and many versions ) belies its mediocrity on a narrative level . the film lurches backward and forward in fits and starts , its central figures adrift and seemingly out of place surrounded by the ersatz decadence of towering sets , the minutia of production detail and the , by 1984 , cliche ' d but gorgeous cinematographic confection on offer to the audience . the plot ' s time frame is confusing , gimmicky and laboured , leading some critics to imagine the noodles figure ' s opium binging to be the antecedent of some future ' dream reality ' as well as the sepia-toned remembrances . this ham handed , overly fan boy-apologetic interpretation glosses over the glaring narrative irregularities on display . even at this full ( ? ) running time , figures appear and disappear with alarming suddenness : the deborah character is fleetingly established in child form , a cold and unattainable ' trophy ' female , not even hinting at the gravity with which she will re-establish her relationship with a post-prison noodles , the said re-union henceforth rings completely false . the deadening pace is somewhat to blame , certain sequences drag along stagnantly for far too long , signifying very little , hinting at a director with so little restraint and narrative economy that he often feels obligated to usurp every iota of screen time possible in order to show off his production , fatal for a film that contains figures so sullen and aloof . the trajectory of the figures ' lives is presented to us as a microcosm mirroring the historical trajectory of america ' s teens through prohibition and its spoils , ending with the ( arguable ) ruin of its moribund central figures ( save deborah- a make up department fumble or intentional one wonders ) . this notion is commonplace , even banal . the cast of characters as imagined in the one note script ( written by seven italians no less ) are flatly and awkwardly played by all but the younger actors , who at least venture a few variant facial expressions . this is understandable given the almost unworkable material . some critics state that the characters may seem so impenetrably self-absorbed , but actively seek their own goals , assuming the compliance of others ( e . g . when noodles gets out of prison , max picks him up and offers him a hooker without asking him whether or not this is what he desires and later makes deals assuming noodles will comply ) . this explanation of their abrupt , abrasive dispositions is unsatisfactorily extraneous and merely serves to highlight the complicated ends the films unwavering supporters will go to to defend their positions regarding a film unfortunately short on sense . although ennio morricone ' s score is much revered , it is undeniably schmaltzy and repetitive , it gushes with an emotional redolence that the scenes themselves , many violent , just do not warrant . at points it is questionable whether or not morricone was watching the same film i was so incongruous is his work . as a paean to american filmmaking , it succeeds in terms of mood ( helped by a few strokes of masterful editing segueing between time periods ) and visuals ( not helped by said score ) but lacks narrative cohesion and fluidity .  it is very possible that i simply didn ' t give the movie a fair enough chance because it was so immediately unappealing to me ( something similar happened with triplets of belleville ) , but i really should have caught on when i put the film on and my roommate , an exchange student from japan , immediately started laughing at the movie , saying that it sounded dumb . now , i don ' t agree that it is dumb , the animation is very simple but clearly very skilled . it ' s like classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism to them while remaining strictly in the realm of the surreal at the same time . 

but the subject matter is entirely unappealing to me . it has an interesting message about stinginess and greed , but it is wrapped in such an unpleasant package that it is almost not worth learning , especially because you already knew it anyway . the sound effects while the man is loudly gobbling cherries and cherry pits , for example , are indeed repulsive . 

there was a clever scene of animation as we kept diving endlessly into the hole that the man finds in his head when he pulls the sapling out of his scalp , but it goes on for so long that it seems to overshadow everything else . there is so much stock put into that one sequence that it is almost like the whole movie is about it . 

as i said about triplets of belleville , this would have been a great thing for a late night tv program like adult swim , or its japanese counterpart , but an academy award nominated film ? it gives me the impression that there is not generally a long list of animated short films for the academy to choose from .  early jackie chan film where there is no sign of the chan persona we know . this is chan in a full on traditional revenge tale of the sort that was cloned and re-cloned by countless producers and studios all through hong kong taiwan and mainland china . its a very serious story that shows none of the humor and warmth that would catapult jackie chan to super stardom . its also clear from watching this that had he not reinvented himself odds are we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short . as a film on its own merits this is a good looking but pretty unremarkable movie . i was watching it , in the midst of an all day marathon of martial arts films and it would have blended together with every other film that i watched that day had i not noticed jackie in the film . honestly i don ' t think the film is really worth bothering with ( there are too many other better variations ) except if you ' re interested in seeing where jackie chan started .  the big problem i had with this movie was that lombard ' s character is , as another user put it , " unnecessarily cruel " . lombard plays the role of ann krausheimer smith , who believes she is married to david smith , played well by the sharply dressed yet appropriately bumbling robert montgomery . the movie has some funny moments , especially when montgomery ' s character goes to great lengths to try to get his " wife " back . understandably , she is upset because the marriage is technically not legal , but she only finds out three years into it . 

lombard ' s character seems quite cold to her " husband ' s " sincere attempts to woo her back . while not being highly adept in that effort , montgomery is nevertheless visibly loving , and yet lombard is as cool as a pillar of ice . there are almost no clues suggesting any sort of reconciliation between the warring couple for much of the movie , and it is hard to see any sort of comedy- even dark comedy- in that aspect . to some extent , the movie almost suggests a sadistic undertone , with lombard ' s character getting a " kick " out of her husband ' s feeble efforts . while one might consider this another ' battle of the sexes ' type of movie , the reality is that it is a highly lopsided battle , if that : montgomery ' s character , while certainly flawed , is not flawed enough to make it a typical exemplar of the masculine chauvinist / misogynist ( an excellent example of that is michael douglas in ' war of the roses ' ) . in fact , the character is largely effeminate , as revealed by not only the sharp dress of montgomery ( which probably owes largely to the perennially sharply dressed actor himself ) , but also to his discomfort in attempting-but failing- to play the role of a womanizing bachelor . his only major flaw is his vanity , but that fault does not balance out with his partner ' s excessive cruelty . and there is no suggestion that she is trying to instill any jealousy out of subconscious love . this is what makes it so cruel , and sad . montgomery ' s character simply looks weak . in reality , no wife would want a man so weak unless she " wears the pants " in the marriage . but then again , a woman who wears the pants in a marriage would never seek to be so cruel because she has already affirmed that role early on . hence , the whole theme seems weird . this movie is neither a champion of feminism ( lombard ' s character does show some signs of the sort of independent-oriented woman of the 60s , but that idea is soon quashed and the character falls back into the 1940s ) , nor an even-sided battle of the sexes ( as montgomery ' s character is truly a cipher of masculinity and therefore a lost cause ) . 

this movie is , on the surface , a slapstick , but beneath that veneer it is really much darker , with sadistic undertones . all of which makes its resolution appear , well , odd . ( maybe that oddity was the whole point ? ) . in any case , slapstick this movie is not .  lord david cecil wrote an interesting book in the 1930s early victorian novelists , where he looked at the works of dickens , thackeray , eliot , trollope , mrs . gaskell , charlotte bronte , and emily bronte . he selected these writers as the popular favorites of the first half of the victorian period , and he explained their strengths and weaknesses ( as he saw them ) to the reading public . some of his comments are quite relevant to this day , but like all criticism it gives an idea of the spirit of the times of the critic ' s life as well . 

cecil thought highly of george eliot ( mary ann cross ) , who wrote about seven or eight books ( including sketches and poetry ) . but for most modern readers , they are usually acquainted with her shortest book , silas marner , which is still read in some high school curriculum . the other books , felix holt the radical , daniel deronda , middlemarch , the mill on the floss , adam bede , romola , scenes of clerical life , are still in print ( penguin , for example , has most of them in print ) , but are mostly unread . the one of most interest today is her last novel , deronda , where she discusses the jews in english society , and an incipient , pre-hertzl type of zionism . romola is her sole attempt at a historic novel ( about savanarola ' s experiment of a religiously pure republic in florence in the 1490s ) . her meatiest novel is middlemarch , which is concerned with english society in the provinces in 1832 , the year of the great reform bill of lord grey . i had to read middlemarch in college for a literature course . it certainly is a thoughtful book ( virginia woolf called it the most grown-up book in the english language ) . but it suffers ( like all of eliot ' s novels ) from one defect - she cannot write livable , exciting prose . while dickens is overly exuberant at times , and thackeray can become pompous and prolix , and trollope can become ( as lord cecil says ) very ordinary in his discussion , and charlotte bronte can fail to explain certain relationships well , and mrs . gaskell seems best dealing with female characters , all of them ( and emily bronte in her single novel ) hold the reader ' s interest . reading most of eliot ' s novels is like trying to chisel sentences out of blocks of marble with a toothpick ! 

to date i have read about fifty pages of mill of the floss . i notice that one of the other reviewers never finished the novel too . but i have read a synopsis of what it is about . the tullivers ( maggie and her brother tom ) are the central figures - they own the mill in the title . although close at the start of the story , maggie falls in love with the son of a neighbor whose father is involved in legal difficulties with mr . tulliver sr . tom takes a dim view of this relationship , and the tragedy of the story is regarding the split between the siblings , culminating in their demise at the conclusion ( maggie runs back to the mill to rescue tom during a heavy flood , and they die together ) . it must have been a success with victorian readers , but it is very gloomy and depressing to modern audiences . 

the movie changed the ending a little - maggie ( geraldine fitzgerald ) does die at the end with her lover , and tom ( james mason ) notes their deaths at the conclusion in his record book . the story is totally rewritten , except for a double death in the flood at the conclusion . it doesn ' t really help matters . although fitzgerald and mason do pretty well with their parts , they can ' t really pull the film up by their work alone . the end result is a fairly minor film , that fortunately did not hurt the lead ' s careers . the only other thing to note is that the boyfriend was played by frank lawton , who two years earlier played david copperfield as a grown up opposite w . c . fields , lionel barrymore , and maureen o ' sullivan . but then , lawton never really had a major film career - he just happened to always be around in pictures , some good , some mediocre .   ' a comedy of biblical proportions ! ' those masters of hyperbole , the movie-tag-line-writers , at it again ; the sequel to 2003 ' s bruce almighty , raises barely a chuckle . the only thing which raises my interest in this movie above total indifference is its dogmatic christian undertones . sorry , make that overtones . 

steve carrel , ignoring jim carrey ' s good sense to decline a role reprisal , plays evan baxter , the smug news anchor from bruce almighty , who has just been elected to congress . with a new life in virginia and the stress of moving into a house the size of the acropolis , the pressure of all the change takes its toll on his family . his wife ( lauren graham ) , evidently airlifted in from stepford , and three sons ( jimmy bennett , graham phillips and johnny simmons ) , who do a stilted job of looking sad to a piano accompaniment , pray for the family to become closer , and almost out of guilt , so does evan . 

in what must be the greatest shock of all time , god ( morgan freeman ) actually shows up , but does the whole pesky ' working in mysterious ways ' thing all over the place by telling evan to build a noah-esquire ark in preparation for a great flood instead of just giving him a pool table or and x-box or something . and in true mischievous deity style , he also forces evan to grow a beard , long hair and wear worn and tatty robes . now , back in the day i ' m sure razors were hard to come by so the beard was somewhat of an inevitability for noah , but i ' m almost certain it had nothing to do with spirituality . same with the robes ; a massive construction job is surely made all the more difficult by such impractical clothing . couldn ' t god have conjured up a pair of steel toed boots and a hard hat for the poor guy ? apparently not . 

to paraphrase bill hicks , i find the idea that god is messing with us somewhat unsettling , and so does evan who fights him every step of the way . and who wouldn ' t ? god essentially gets him fired , drives away his loved ones , makes him a laughing stock and at one point actually threatens him . of course god turns out to be right , and the rational , hard working family man who was getting on fine by himself is forced to eat a large slice of bittersweet humble pie . it ' s almost as if to be left alone by god , evan had to tolerate and humour him . what kind of message is that ? 

evan almighty does have a highly commendable environmental slant , with the underlying theme being that the federal government is blind to the damage being done to the world around us . it is also the first film ever to offset its carbon emissions and this should surely be considered a landmark achievement by a hollywood studio . were it not for the trite , condescending banner of american christianity flying high above it , evan almighty could have been an inoffensive family movie , with a praiseworthy environmental record . but with its confused religious dogma and relentless ' blind faith ' message , it ranks as one of the most repugnant movies of all time .  watching " baghban " is the movie equivalent of trying to eat one ' s way out of a vat of saltwater taffy for nigh unto three hours . this indian film is a sticky sweet , sentimental soap opera that starts off like " king lear , " moves on to " romeo and juliet " in the middle section , then heads back again to " king lear " for its tear-soaked finale . 

raj malhotra is a bank accountant who seems to have everything a man could possibly want out of life : a wife who adores him , a family who loves him , and a job from which he is about to retire after a lifetime of faithful service . even though raj and his wife , pooja , have been married for 40 years and have four grown sons , they still act like a couple of love struck newlyweds , cooing and sighing , batting their eyes at one another and whispering sweet nothings into each other ' s ears almost to the point of nausea . in fact , the whole bloody brood is so happy , loving and harmonious that they make the von trapps look like a dysfunctional family in comparison . the parents and children joke together , laugh together , even perform elaborately choreographed , " spontaneous " song-and-dance numbers together ( like many bollywood productions , " baghban " is a drama interspersed with a great number - in this case , far too great a number - of musical sequences ) . 

anyone who knows anything at all about storytelling is aware that such unadulterated bliss can not be allowed to go unpunished for long , and that all that joy is merely the prelude to some awful catastrophe destined to come crashing down on the heads of our unsuspecting revelers . knowing this , we spend the first hour of the film in fearful expectation , wondering just what form that disaster will take when it does finally arrive . the thunderclap occurs about an hour into the film , when raj announces to his children that he and their mother have decided to move in with one of their families , leaving the choice of which one it will be up to the kids and their respective spouses . suddenly , like king lear discovering the vipers hidden in the familial bosom , raj finds out that his children are not quite as loving , selfless and eager to share their homes and lives with their parents as he had originally thought . understandably horrified at the prospect , the kids , in order to foil their parents ' plan , come up with a scheme in which raj will go live with one of their children , while pooja will live with another ; then they will switch off until , eventually , each of the children has had a chance to host both parents and then the cycle will repeat itself ad infinitum . much to the chagrin of the kids , the parents accede to the plan , even though the two are deeply in love with one another and have never spent any time apart . thus , the second and most of the third hour are spent with the two aging ( albeit married ) lovers pining away for one another , while their ungrateful , insensitive little brats do everything in their power to make their parents understand how unwelcome they are in their homes . 

one of the major problems with " baghban " is that it lacks subtlety in both its storytelling and direction . the love that ray and pooja feel for one another , as well as the almost giddy closeness of the family unit , is laid on so thickly in the first hour that the film almost collapses under the weight of the sentimentality . then , virtually without any warning , the screenplay turns on a dime and converts the kids into callous , self-centered monsters and the parents into passive , whiny victims of that callousness . raj and pooja are a little too long in the tooth and a little too self-reliant to be doing the dreamy-eyed , pouting , unrequited love bit , more appropriate to lovelorn school kids than the parents of four grown children . the purple prose style , in which every emotion is underlined and highlighted , leads to intense overacting and a heavy reliance on corny reaction shots and melodramatic music for punctuation . the musical numbers convey a certain liberating joy in the beginning , but they go on for so long and turn up so frequently that they quickly lose their effectiveness and serve only to pad out the material to unendurable proportions . at least a full hour could be excised from this bloated production with no discernible harm being done - and quite a bit of good . there really is no reason why this film needs to drag on for a punishing three hours . most egregious of all is the seemingly endless harangue we are subjected to an the end , a speech in which raj ( who has somehow managed to turn his experiences into an award-winning bestseller ) lectures us all on the verities of parent / child relationships for ten straight minutes at the very least . 

 " baghban " is a sappy , corny saga , filled with more sugar and goo than a king-sized box of see ' s chocolates . sample at your own risk .  this frothy romantic comedy is based on the kind of story i loved as a teenager , but now find rather distasteful . in the case of may-september attachments , doubtless what is on the mind of the elder party is either lust , or an inability to face the reality of aging , or both . and the younger is most likely looking for the kind parent that she ( or he ) lacked as a child . these underlying agendas seem more pathetic than romantic to me now ; there is also something rather predatory about them . 

dick powell looked a bit embarrassed--as well he should--at playing the elder lover in this silly story . he was , at fifty , attempting the role of a thirty-eight-year-old man romancing a teen-ager . but young debbie reynolds was a knockout--pretty and saucy and full of vinegar--as a misbehaving seventeen-year-old presented as a kind of " gift " to the morally upright and honest screenwriter , as a subject for him to study . her spirited performance wrung from me a better rating than this film would otherwise deserve . anne francis was cast as powell ' s beautiful , but brittle fiancÃ©e , and handled her small role deftly . 

some of the dialogue was quite amusing , too , so it ' s not a total washout . 

5 / 10 shaggy , friendly yet frustrating film has the same old message : if you want to make it in this world , being imaginative isn ' t enough , you have to live up to your place in society and that means living by the ( heterosexual ) rules that govern us . drag queen comedy-drama from australia is a mostly upbeat journey of three male friends traveling across the outback in their pink bus , christened priscilla . while not a formula film per se , there are the obligatory " road movie " sequences ( bonding by the bonfire , facing down the rednecks , etc . ) . writer-director stephan elliott follows every potentially mean-spirited moment with a little humor and sympathy , but there are puzzling gaps in his narrative , a dire subplot about a gay man ' s relationship with his ex-wife and estranged pre-teen son ( both of whom are comfortable--and the child wise--with his lifestyle ) , and a third act with no energy whatsoever . it has some wicked transvestite humor and a fairly game cast , but a script that seems to have been watered down along the way . * * from * * *  i had to watch this movie for a film class , i suffered the whole time through . i am not asian but was still greatly offended by this film . the film ' s basis is racialism , overall minorities ( rex harrison isn ' t even asian ! ) are depicted in narrow-minded manner . the banning of the film in thailand illustrates the degree inaccuracy and subjective portrayal of asians . in addition , there has been critical attention given to biography of anna . many critics argue that anna added many fictitious events to her story to project herself in a good manner . some critics of the film and biography have even stated that anna made up the whole story . an awful film but good for discussion of biopics as form of meta-narrative fiction rather than a work of non-fiction .  after seeing forever hollywood , it would be natural to want to see a john waters film . at least , one get to say that they have joined the legions of cinema cognoscenti who have experienced the unique cinematic stylings of perhaps the best known non-mainstream director . it ' s worth the effort , and pf is a lot better than eraserhead , and there is a certain campiness about his films which his followers find addicting .  most critics have written devastating about that michalkov-movie , but i wanted it to see myself . and , unfortunately , they are right . the film had the greatest budget ever in russian movie history , two international stars , colorful mass scenes , apparently shot quite close to the kremlin - but in the end it appears to be a nice , sweet nothing . you would not believe , that this director earlier has made masterpieces like urga and burnt by the sun . the characters in the storyline are not convincing , neither jane nor mccracken nor andrej . only general radlov worth being mentioned . it remains on the surface all the time . politically it is to me a glorification of the army , and especially the russian one with values like honor and duty . and , having lived at least half a year in siberia : my russia is much more than the one that is depicted in michalkovs movie . regarding " burnt by the sun " by the same director as a no-question-10-points-movie , one of the best i ever seen in my entire life , i was totally disappointed by that one . sorry . nevertheless , michalkovs unique talent in delivering amazingly beautiful pictures is still there .  james cagney plays richard gargan ( nicknamed " patsy " ! ) , a former gangster now overseeing the surly lads as the new superintendent of a state-run reform school . tepid genre entry wherein cagney ' s the whole show ; he dominates the picture , but only because there ' s not much else of interest going on . jimmy gives just what ' s expected from his hard-boiled persona , which can be satisfying if you ' re in for a quick fix . the direction ( by archie mayo , though michael curtiz was said to have helped ) is straightforward without being particularly gripping , although the narrative slips in the second-half , grinding the film down to a messy conclusion ( with even cagney ' s patsy getting lost in the shuffle ) . remade in 1938 as " crime school " and again in 1939 as " hell ' s kitchen " . * * from * * * *  this series , made for televisiÃ³n espaÃ±ola ( tve ) is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968 , primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest son . 

based on a background of historical events , such as the may 1968 student uprising in france , the decaying franco regime , the war in viet-nam , the rise of imperialism , and others specifically related to spanish life at that particular moment , one might regard this series as a simple compilation of characteristic foibles which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment . 

generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic , the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can rember those times , as , it should be stated , anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is busily occupied in other things . 

the best thing that can be said of this series is ana duato ' s rÃ´le as mother of three children : she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well , manifesting that peculiar spanish penchant , especially noticeable among women , of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart , without any resorting to the use of the brain . as we say in spain , common sense is one of the least common senses . imanol arias offers very little , apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman as in other television series . indeed , as an actor , he should not be trusted in anything which is not a tv series . his resources are too limited ; however , his part as father of the working-class household is not at all bad . 

not really recommendable for other audiences , even spanish-speakers in latin america : the themes are all too parochially related to a specific spot in contemporary spanish history , such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references . it is even probable that certain situations which cause a few spanish smiles would not mean anything to other viewers .  the movie opens with charlie ( jeff daniels ) , a business man just finishing his lunch in a neighborhood deli . it appears he doesn ' t have enough cash to cover the check . instead of reaching for his plastic , he furtively glances around to see if the coast is clear and ducks out of the place without paying . unbeknownst to charlie , " lulu " ( melanie griffith ) had been observing him from the other side of the deli . 

 " lulu " is decked out in what passed for cool back in the 1980 ' s with a brunette page-boy cut . she follows him out to let him know that she saw what he did . he tries to deny it but can ' t escape her accusation . thinking he ' s in it , charlie is surprised when " lulu " says she doesn ' t work for the deli and then offers him a ride back to work . 

when she heads in the opposite direction , thus begins their cavorting across the middle atlantic seaboard . 

we ' re supposed to get titillated as thoroughly modern " lulu " puts straight-laced charlie into humiliating situations . it ' s all right when the two consenting adults get a little kinky in a motel room but off-putting when they wriggle out of paying the check at a family-style restaurant . stealing the labor from hard-working people is not my idea of " wild " . charlie is a jerk . 

 " lulu " is a loony jerk . she starts to pass off charlie as her husband . first to her mom ( who blithely tolerates the charade ) and then at her conveniently timed 10-year high school reunion ( an event used later by another too-cool-for-its-own-good movie " grosse pointe blank " ) . 

the " marriage " comes as a surprise to " lulu " ' s real husband ( ray liotta ) who ' s just been recently released from prison for armed robbery . ray gives the two a welcome comeuppance and shows them how nasty crime really is . 

i can ' t add any irony by writing that i first watched this by sneaking in the movie theater . no , i don ' t do that sort of thing . i taped it off of cable tv and assure you i view it strictly in the privacy of my own home . 

so i got to thinking why i taped it when i don ' t like it very much and conclude that 20 years ago i was on a reggae kick and the soundtrack of " something wild " does prominently feature reggae . the closing credits start with the treat of sister carol performing her version of " wild thing " .  this is a semi fictional memoir of an " international man " who have witnessed various political upheavals in recent 30 years . 

i was hoping that this film would offer unique insight into politics and war . i was also hoping that it would be touching and affecting . however , i was disappointed by this film . " chico " seemed fragmentary , with the main character , ricardo , staying in one country for 10 to 20 minutes . as could be expected , no detailed storyline could be elaborated in such time frame . the excuses of him moving to another place were often perfunctorily explained . the result was a disappointing collection of fragmented clips shot in various countries .  aka

1978 : a working class teenager ( matthew leitch ) assumes a false identity and gatecrashes high society , where he learns harsh lessons about the divisions between rich and poor . 

autobiographical feature by director duncan roy ( jackson : my life . . . your fault ) , an exposÃ© of the pre-thatcherite aristocracy , as seen through the eyes of a low-rent ' commoner ' whose world view is transformed by his adventures amongst the upper classes . unfortunately , roy ' s screenplay says very little we didn ' t already know about the excesses of the idle rich , and the narrative is only briefly ignited by leitch ' s relationship with a handsome but self-destructive rent boy ( peter youngblood hills ) who turns out to be no less hypocritical than the very people he seeks to emulate . also starring diana quick ( as an outrageous snob who believes working class people are " embarrassed to be alive " ! ) , bill nighy as the black sheep of a wealthy family , lindsay coulson ( " eastenders " ) , blake ritson ( different for girls ) and georgina hale in a typically flamboyant cameo , flashing her boobs at all and sundry , without a care in the world ! 

unfortunately , much of the film ' s impact is diluted by roy ' s insistence on using a triptych effect ( three separate 1 . 78 : 1 images are letterboxed within the 2 . 39 : 1 frame , each one providing a different viewpoint of individual scenes ) , which shrinks the image and distances viewers from events on-screen . a long , pointless film , too personal for wide appeal , and hampered throughout by a cinematic process which fails to reconcile the story at hand . a single-image version is also available ( framed theatrically at 1 . 85 : 1 ) , with the on-screen title aka : lies are like wishes .  director michael ritchie and actor robert redford ' s second documentary-style drama , ' the candidate ' , is a political satire that still seems fresh and pertinent today . so it ' s a pity that ' downhill racer ' , made a short time before , seems so dated by contrast . the music is ugly , and the perhaps innovative ski-ing sequences are now standard in televisual coverage of the sport . the world of ski-ing seems strangely amateurish ( probably accurately , given the time the movie was made , but it ' s hard to relate to today ' s professional world ) , and the theme of americans in europe likewise seems hundrum in an age of ever easier travel . perhaps the biggest problem is the flat plot , centred on the arrogant but enigmatic hero ; unfortunately , it ' s a dreary performance from redford , offering us little insight into his cares or motivations . and a character-driven film without much of a character is never a good bet . i expected much , but sadly this is a boring movie .  the main character , pharaon , has suffered a loss of his wife and child in the pre-film past . he deals with with by just shutting down emotionally . too long a movie , too much time spent on pharaon ' s inexpressive face , too much " road time " ( one of the banes of tv : filling time with moving cars , trains , etc . ) long scenes of him doing trivial - sometimes totally inexplicable , nonsensically trivial - actions with neither reason or emotion . his best friends joseph and domino are not much more , their relationship based on sex ( this film perhaps gives new meaning to the phrase " gratuitous sex " ) ; domino and pharaon ' s mother are the two characters who display some emotion , but not much . it is hard to tell with all the characters in this movie : is it indifferent acting , indifferent writing , or simply indifferent characters portrayed by good writing and good acting . characters in this film talk very little to anyone ; it ' s little wonder their emotionally isolated , which is all the more bizarre because it ' s clear they live in a neighborhood where the people are friendly and know each other .  this is a film that has garnered any interest or praise it has received simply on the merit of being a lesbian interest piece . the performances are mostly emotionless compared to better films in the glbt interest genre . the entirety of the film ' s watchable value is garnered through modest suspense over whether and when the partners ' family members will say something discouraging about their lesbian relationship . the best element of the film is likely the beautiful new england scenery , although much of the film is set inside . it is hard to envision how any viewer watching this film and not seeking affirmation of their glbt lifestyle or wishing to see that of others affirmed , even through poorly realized drama , could appreciate treading water in any significant way . it is a terrible movie .  i had been delighted to find that tcm was showing this , as i love the 1992 version with josie lawrence , jim broadbent , joan plowright . . . this film had a luminous ann harding , a wonderful performance by frank morgan , but others ' acting made the film more of a farce then the wonderful unfolding that the later film . reginald owen ' s arbuthnot is painful to watch and you can ' t understand why his wife adores him . i found out after watching the film that it was based on the stage play where the 1992 film is based on the book . the original film also felt like it was a snippet of a larger piece and felt incomplete . too bad it was such a let-down .  in addition to all the negative reviews : i was amazed to see that at the drop of a hat somewhere , somehow a cctv-camera was summoned at a most unlikely location , to show the ' crisis ' -team ( ' ' look maaaaa-aaam ' ' ) what was going on , notably near the thames-barrier , where the professor is hit at full ( wind ) force against the head by a heavy object and subsequently lives to tell the story . otherwise i was unable to shake off the image of some actors as portrayed in other films / programs : i said to my wife : ' hey , that ' s neil , from the young ones ' ( nigel planer ) and ' did they summon hercule poirot for help ? ' ( david suchet ) . to add to the disgrace of this film ( shown in two parts on itv uk recently ) , itv showed the telephone number of the environment agency after each episode for worried viewers , living in areas ' at risk of flooding ' . how low can you as a broadcaster go to treat your audience like that ? what must the environment agency have thought ? ? ( ' ' oh no , it ' s mrs jones from hull again . she says she was right all along , she saw it on itv ' ' ) .  wow . . . 

reading through these comments , i see a remarkable socio-cultural clash theme emerging between the us and . . . the dutch ! the us p . o . v . appears to be that this is quite a good little movie , parker being a likable hero , the story a light-hearted rendition of what could be a glorified form of reality . 

all three dutch reviewers view the world through a totally different pair of glasses it seems . they categorically and in surprisingly similar terms agree the movie is a disaster . 

far be it from me to take sides in what appears to be a dispute between cultures , on this item as wide apart as the ocean that separates them geographically . still , based on factual observation - i saw the movie with my very own eyes - i suspect the dutch are not too far off the mark : 

 " parker kane " is poorly made , utterly boring , and really not worth the celluloid that was no doubt wasted in its creation .  man , is this lousy . it doesn ' t deserve much in the way of comment so , keeping it brief , rebecca demornay is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who falls for latin lover antonio banderas in a wine store , he of the ponytail and jail-house tats . when she cuts loose , she really cuts loose . other than this torrid affair she ' s having ( and we must admit the affair has its speed bumps ) she ' s a pretty cold fish . her broke , ailing father shows up for the first time in years and she boots him out . she ' s also adept at keeping her horny upstairs neighbor ( dennis miller ) at bay . and there ' s prisoner harry dean stanton who ' s trying to maneuver her into giving him a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder so he won ' t have his privates nailed to the wall for the serial murders he ' s committed . 

all these people , and perhaps more , are immediately suspect when strange things begin happening to her . somebody sends her dead flowers . somebody does unspeakable things to her pet cat . ( the next time i see a household pet turn up in a parcel or strung up in the closet or boiled in a pot , i ' m going to puke . ) so who ' s doing it ? guess . no power on earth could force me to reveal the ending , but maybe a hint will help : childhood abuse . 

the abuse excuse is an interesting business in itself , far more interesting than the movie . what does " childhood abuse " mean ? do we mean sexual abuse ? physical ? both ? how about whacking a kid over the back with a wooden cooking spoon , hard enough to break it ? that ' s what happened to me and my brother when we were kids , just as similar things happened to all the other errant boys in the neighborhood . sexual abuse ? that never happened to any of us , as far as i know , although i ' m not sure it would have been rejected with any degree of animation . in the samoan village i studied for two years , there was one case of an adolescent boy found playing sexually with a much younger girl . the girl ' s family beat hell out of him . the boy ' s own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village , an exile that lasted two years . by the time he returned the incident was forgotten by everyone , including the child . ( by the way , the little girl we see here is under five so it ' s unlikely that she ' d remember dad ' s night-time visits in any case since long-term memory isn ' t really established until about that time . ) demornay ' s experience leading to her mental disorder can be called " the social construction of trauma . " it ' s not there unless we put it there . enough of the psychiatric lecture . that will be fifteen cents . 

you want trauma ? i ' ll give you trauma . the film absolutely forces us to identify with rebecca demornay ' s character , right from the beginning . then , when she has her first tryst with antonio banderas , and pio donnagio ' s score is pounding the eroticism into our heads , the camera gives us a shot from over her shoulder of the bare-torsoed antonio crawling over us with his hairy chest . now that ' s traumatic . it makes any male viewer feel as if he ' s on the floor of the laundry room at the california men ' s colony in san luis obispo . don ' t get me wrong . i don ' t dislike antonio banderas . it ' s just that i ' m not in love with him . there aren ' t enough nude shots of rebecca demornay ' s elfin body in the entire universe to compensate for that kind of anxiety . 

here ' s an engaging way of surviving this movie . instead of just sitting there puling , try picking out the scenes that were filmed in toronto and separating them from the ones shot in budapest . it ' s a challenge , really , and may , for all we know , preserve your sanity .  i liked the whole set up with ceasar ' s palace , the roman guards , and announcers in togas . this event also marked " the passing of the torch " as far as the voice of the wwf goes . gorilla monsoon who had done the play by play for every wwf ppv up to this point opens up and gives the typical introduction making it look like he ' s there to announce another ppv . but then introduces jim ross who is making his wwf debut and jr continues to do the wwf commentary to this day . but outside of that , this event is pure garbage . good ol scientific wrestling has been thrown out the window and enter the birth of gimmicks . this to me was the event that the wwf started to go down the toilet , and didn ' t recover until the attitude era of the late 90 ' s . here ' s a review of the event . 

ic title match : tatanka ( challenger ) vs . shawn michaels ( champ ) : an okay opener , but given what shawn is capable of , it was very disappointing . i have no idea why the wwf was hell bent on putting tatanka over . they should of realized that shawn was the future and tatanka was just some hyper wrestler in an indian gimick . the ending of the match itself was very lame . shawn grabs the ref and pulls him out , then gets called for a count out . while it was fun watching sherri get beat up afterwords , this match just was forgettable . shawn had to carry this match and had trouble doing it . 

the stenier brothers vs . the headshrinkers : steiners get the win via a franknsteiner . this match had it ' s moments , but the crowd just didn ' t seem into it . there was no heat behind it , i think it was a match just to throw two tag teams in . 

crush vs . doink the clown : terrible ! terrible ! terrible ! this match completely sucked . two very lame gimmicks . a clown and a hawaiian dressed in bizarre colors . the ending caught everybody by surprise . in the upcoming months , crush turned heel and doink turned face , but none of the fans seem to care . sadly , this was not the worst match on the card . 

razor ramon vs . bob backland : you got a brand new heel that is very over going against a wrestler who was forgotten about 10 years ago . the fans snicker and laugh when backlund comes out . and like hogan / rock in wm18 and hhh / owen in wm14 , the heel wrestler gets louder cheers in the face . thankfully this match was short . the right guy won , but i wish they had razor totally beat the crap out of and squash backlund rather than winning by a small package out of nowhere . 

tag team champion match : ted dibiase and irs ( champs ) vs . hulk hogan & brutus beefcake w / jimmy hart i still would like to know the full story on what happened to hogan ' s eye . oh well . the crowd was really into this match , but it had no flow to it what so ever . hogan and beefcake were clearly suffering ring rust given that both wrestlers had been on the shelf for at least a year . dibiase , being the great technical wrestler that he was , did help to carry the match from being a complete waste . the ending was a surprise with dibiase and irs getting the win via dq . but to please the crowd , hogan and beefcake did their usual playing to the crowd at the end like they had won the match . 

lex luger vs . mr . perfect : the best part of this match was the four hot chicks that accompanied lex luger to the ring . other than that , this was completely forgettable . the mr . perfect gimmick was born for a heel role and he just lacked the heat as a face . and luger is just a waste of time no matter what gimmick he ' s in . luger wins via a backslide despite that perfect ' s feet were in the ropes . then perfect spends the post match getting his butt kicked . first luger knocks him out with the running elbow . then when perfect regains consciousness he goes back to the dressing room to find luger only to get the crap beaten out of him by shawn michaels , setting up an hbk / perfect feud that had the potential to be a classic but the wwf misused . 

the undertaker vs . giant gonzales : absolute crap ! ! what was the wwf thinking bringing in such a horrible wrestler as giant gonzales . sure he had size , but i ' d rather watch the brooklyn brawler in a match than him . this isn ' t even worth commenting on . 

wwf championship match : bret hart ( champ ) vs . yokozuna ( challenger ) you have one of the greatest technical wrestlers of all time going against a guy who ' s only advantage is that he ' s a gigantic lard ass . bret was able to carry the match , but a rather predictable ending with mr . fuji throwing salt in bret ' s face . 

post match : yokozuna vs . hulk hogan pure crap right here . hogan comes down to the ring for no apparent reason and mr . fuji challenges him to a match after yoko just won the title . even the die-hard hulkamaniacs find this to be total bs .  richard donner shows off his liberal credentials with this ludicrously overcooked simplistic attack on the politics of south africa . it ' s not as if america is the cradle of racial harmony and brotherly love - and further irony is added by the fact that the movie is set in the city that was the home of rodney king and glorifies the police department that did so much towards community relations with their brutal racist behaviour . so donner ' s salt and pepper pairing who clearly have a late = developing teenage crush on one another do their own thing with fine disregard for the rule of law or the rules of evidence and no one worries because the bad guys are white south africans - surely a worrying example of police racism in itself ? inside rudd ' s ( joss ackland - eminently hissable ) office the decor is designed and lit to resemble as far as possible the fuhrerbunker and just in case some rather dumb moviegoers miss the point , he and his men are referred to as " nazis " at regular intervals . for me the only bright spot in the movie was when mel gibson turned up at an anti - apartheid demonstration carrying a banner bearing the inscription " end aparthied now " . the intensely irritating joe pesci is introduced into the franchise to take some of the weight off the boys ' shoulders by following them around yapping incessantly like a badly-trained puppy . this would be bearable if there was the remotest possibility of him ending up in a concrete overcoat , but sadly he survives to irritate another day . miss patsy kensit seems in a world of her own , perhaps not believing her luck at being cast opposite mel gibson who has little trouble sweeping her into bed in his mobile home which appears to have been washed up on a beach somewhere . shortly after consummating their affair they come under fire from a number of helicopters that fire enough rounds into mel ' s caravan to keep the u . s . army in iraq going for six months . fortunately he has a pet dog who is not afraid to cause coitus interruptus just as they are going for seconds and his barking warns them of the imminent attack . i hope he got a special bone as a reward . the film climaxes ( without interruption from mel ' s dog ) on a cargo ship bound for nazi germany ( sorry , south africa ) , when mel and danny murder so many members of the master race that i lost count . despite jiggling around like bonnie and clyde under the impact of a hail of bullets , mel survives , curled up in his partner ' s arms like a small child with a wise and benevolent father . take that , apartheid !   ( synopsis ) in the year 2055 , the rich are able to travel back in time and hunt a live dinosaur for a huge price . sonia rand ( catherine mccormack ) has developed a machine that can take people back in time . charles hatton ( ben kingsley ) has taken this technology and opened a business know as time safari . anyone with the money can travel back millions of years and shoot a dinosaur . dr . travis ryer ( edward burns ) leads his team together with the big game hunter on a floating walkway to a spot where they can kill the dinosaur . the trip protocol is that they must stay on the walkway and not disturb the land or anything creature around them . unfortunately for the human race , one hunter steps on and kills a butterfly . this insignificant act causes major impacts to the earth ' s climate and creates new species of animal life . the course of evolution as we know it is now being changed by time waves . travis and sonia try to stop the changing process before it becomes permanent , and man becomes extinct . 

 ( comment ) the movie was a little slow and the concept of going back in time and changing things was a little overdone . the death of a single butterfly causing the tremendous changes in the world ' s atmosphere and evolution is simply ridiculous . they changed the skyline of chicago to look modern , but the new cars of the future were silly looking . you can wait to see this fantasy on dvd . ( warner brothers pictures , run time 1 : 43 , rated pg-13 ) ( 4 / 10 )  this film is strictly for fans of debbie reynolds and eddie fisher . 

i get angry at tcm for showing this mess more frequently than bachelor mother , the delightful original . i get angrier still that some hollywood boob thought it would be a good idea to remake bachelor mother , filling it with some lame songs that only serve to interrupt the flow of a cute comedy . instead , hollywood could have spent the time , money , energy and talent wasted on this horrible remake to give us something new and original - wow , what a concept ! 

bachelor mother ( the original ) , with ginger rogers and david niven is a spicy stew , simmering with sexuality . it is a 1930 ' s wink at the hays office . bundle of joy ( the remake ) , with debbie reynolds and eddie fisher is strictly milk and cookies . it is a 1950 ' s handshake with eisenhower . 

which cast would you rather watch - debbie reynolds , eddie fisher and adolphe menjou , or ginger rogers , david niven and charles coburn ? for me , every member of the cast in the original version is far better than his / her counterpart in the remake . 

in the original a beautiful , young ginger rogers is at her peak . david niven delivers perfectly as a somewhat spoiled , sophisticated and yet befuddled scion of a wealthy department store magnate . and i always love to see charles coburn in a movie . in bachelor mother , he is priceless as the desperate grandfather wannabe . 

in bundle of joy debbie reynolds is her usual perky self . she is fine in this role , although her performance ( along with fisher ' s ) completely changes the tone of the story . as an actor , eddie fisher is hopeless . he is completely lacking in screen " presence . " here he is way too wholesome for this story . his acting is completely bland and clueless . likewise , his singing is so bland and unremarkable that it has been completely forgotten by the world at large . the only time he is not completely painful is in butterfield 8 - where , incidentally , he doesn ' t sing . here , fisher ' s lame performance alone is enough to ruin this movie . adolphe menjou , a favorite character actor , delivers a competent performance , but not one of his best . he is more blustering than commanding . he and fisher are not convincing as a father and son . 

do you see a musical for the music , the story being merely incidental ? or do watch a musical for a story , with some ( hopefullly ) good music used for seasoning ? if the former , you might like this lame remake . otherwise you are much better off watching the ginger rogers non-musical original , bachelor mother .  this movie narrate the story of john belushi , based of his biography `wired ' , wrote by bob woodward . all of movie is narrate on flashback without a chronological order , where after the death of john belushi we see one angel accompany belushi during few points of his life . michael chicklis in the character of john belushi is enough credible , but entirely devoid of the devastate force of belushi , and his play stay only a pale animation . the director , on more , not succeed to give continuate on the story , that for who not knows the book is very confused . but the worse is that they have featured bob woodward that spoke with belushi before he died . for this negative points the movie is only a would-be attempt to narrate the controversial story of john belushi . my rate is 4 .  ed ( kel mitchell ) is a teenager who lives for his job at good burger , a small but friendly neighborhood hamburger stand , while his buddy dexter ( kennan thompson ) also works there , but lack ed ' s single-minded devotion to his job he ' s there because he accidentally destroyed the car of his teacher mr . wheat ( sinbad ) and has to raise money to pay the damages . when mondo burger , a mammoth fast-foot chain , opens across the street , it looks like good burger is history , until ed formulates a secret sauce that brings hundreds of new customers to their door . however , the monomaniacal manager of mondo burger , kurt ( jan schweiterman ) , is determined to get his hands on the sauce and put good burger out of business . meanwhile , ed and dexter must rescue otis ( abe vigoda ) , the world ' s oldest fast food employee , from the demented hills asylum , and ed might just find love with monique ( shar jackson ) if he could take his mind off the burgers long enough to pay attention to her . good burger is a comedy directed for kids , decent story , acting , and overall a pretty harmless kids movie .  simply miserable lana turner-ezio pinza vehicle . pinza had a beautiful voice but he rarely uses it in a film that reminded me of " the student prince " with adults . pinza is no leading man either . he looks like an elderly man ready to collect social security and go fishing . 

the plot is extremely thin and the supporting cast of barry sullivan , marjorie maine and debbie reynolds are given so little to do . sir cedric hardwicke comes in at the end to announce that our king ezio had better return to his people . as far as i ' m concerned , the faster the better . is that lana turner really singing with pinza ? not bad if it is her . the picture would also remind me in a way of the 1960 movie " the prince and the showgirl " with marilyn monroe and laurence olivier .  for those expecting the cover art and story outline to indicate another entertaining bollywood indian production , beware : no musical dance numbers or songs of production value exist to brighten the mood in this rather tired story of arranged marriages in the british indian culture - with a few variations thrown in . as written by roopesh parekh the script jumps around topics worthy of discussion only to cover them up with routine avoidance tactics . harmage singh kalirai directs like a traffic cop , trying to hold together the disparate subplots to the point of keystone cop tactics . 

jimi ( chris bisson ) is a medical school student who is gay and has a lover jack ( peter ash ) and they live with jack ' s obese , alcoholic , loose morals aunt vanessa ( sally bankes ) and sally ' s chubby daughter hannah ( katy clayton ) . jimi ' s family is visited by the patel family from delhi who bring their beautiful daughter simran ( jinder mahal ) to england to find a husband . jimi ' s parents ( saeed jaffrey and jamila massey ) and his grandmother ( zohra sehgal ) decide simran is the girl for jimi to marry and arrange an engagement and wedding in the custom of indian ways - without consulting jimi . jimi discovers the plot and is too spineless not to go along with it , a decision which enrages jack and infuriates vanessa . hannah tells a ' little lie ' to simran ( that she is jimi ' s daughter ) and the wedding is off . when jimi ' s parents visit jimi ' s house they discover the drunken vanessa , are repulsed by her , but eventually decide that for jimi ' s happiness they will go along with the fact that vanessa has given them a ' granddaughter ' and decide to use the marriage preparations as a wedding for jimi and vanessa . jimi convinces the very reluctant vanessa to go along with the idea and before long vanessa is dressed in a sari , prepared for a wedding , and jimi , terrified at what he is doing just to please his parents , includes jack as his best man . at the wedding the truth comes out and to jimi ' s surprise his family adapts to jimi ' s true self and the day is saved by simply being truthful . 

the cast copes with this silly bit of nonsense rather well and there are some good performances : chris bisson and peter ash are attractive men and play their roles well , albeit without any indication at all of a loving relationship ( the director seems terrified of showing the least suggestion of intimacy between the two men ) ; sally bankes provides most of the laughs as vanessa ; the rest of the cast repeat the stereotype roles they ' ve played countless times in indian movies . this is not a bad film - it has its moments - but it is just too superficial and tired to make us care about any of the characters .  cuore sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired . with a script that the screen-writers for " touched by an angel " might have passed up as being too impuissant , ozpetek still keeps us interested at times . in fact , i wanted to focus on the positives but i found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and awful that i think the couple who jumped to their deaths in the very beginning might have been the fortunate ones . 

this movie is at heart ( pun intended ) a story built on a big twist-style ending . this kind of tenuous foundation can result in a tremendous success like tornatore ' s una pura formalitÃ  or god-awful garbage like the films of m . night shyamalan . cuore sacro falls somewhat closer to the latter . i found the cinematography in general to be above average . the tracking shots of irene dutifully doing her quotidian laps in the pool were very impressive as was the atmosphere conjured by the interior of her mother ' s house . for me , the grotesque parody of michelangelo ' s pieta when giancarlo comes in from the rain and irene poses with him was a bit of a stretch . one big issue that i took exception to in this film was ozpetek ' s method of simply turning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions taking place . this worked to fantastic effect in facing windows , but when employed here it seems that bubolova is no mezzogiorno . in fact besides the ridiculous story , the main problem with this film is the milquetoast performance of it ' s main character . it made the final breakdown scene even more unconscionably bad . 

in this movie ozpetek continues his crusade against our corporate-driven societies by urging us to be more spiritual ( not necessarily religious ) and more altruistic . and while i ' m certainly one who is very sympathetic to this view , i felt as if the audience was being hit over the head with a blunt object . could the characters have been anymore two-dimensional ? i tended to find this movie very enervating and soulless . was the " evil " aunt eleonora anything more than a caricature ? it goes for the people on the side of " right " too , like the " good " aunt maria clara and the elderly doorman aurelio . and just in case we might have missed ozpetek ' s point , he decided to clothe his opposing forces in their own liveries . 

this brings me to an interesting point about the director ' s use of color . he clothes the opening couple who briefly take flight in all black , as well as irene ( when we first meet her and after her life-conversion ) , the evil aunt eleonora , and of course the good but confused padre carras . black is a color that suggests a definite course , the wearer ' s mind is set and emotionless . it is the color of choice for that indispensable item of modern day armor , the business suit . it is also the color of mourning , such as the funerary finery sported by the suicidal duo . finally , black is the color of piety , such as the simple robes of priests and nuns that irene emulates in the second half of the film . 

the other main color , and a very appropriate choice for a movie about the sacred heart , is red . it is a color that has an extreme inherent emotional component . the character who wears red is bold , emotional , receptive to new ideas , and indulgent . red is a risky color in modern times ; it challenges our perceptions of the wearer and at the same time makes the wearer vulnerable . yet red carries an enormous weight of history and mysticism , as the earliest members of cro-magnon man buried their dead in red ochre and indeed the first man named in the torah , adam , is named after the hebrew word for red . red also has an anachronistic flavor , looking back on the past where red ( and by association a less self-driven attitude towards life ) was more accepted . so when we encounter the red-filled room ( the mysterious frieze covered walls complete with a red accented menorah and a red painting of a whirling dervish ! ) of irene ' s mother , " good " characters maria clara and aurelio wearing resplendent outfits of red , and finally the painting of irene ' s mother in a formal red gown we can see where ozpetek ' s sympathies lie . 

a word or two about the soundtrack , i found the original musical themes to be excellently suited to the story . the quasi-baroque theme that signified irene was great for it ' s monotony and feeling of restive malaise ( the absolute best use of a constantly repeated baroque theme such a this would have to be in kubrick ' s barry lyndon , with it ' s masterful repetitions of an 8-bar sarabande attributed to handel ) . one absolutely inspired choice was a couple of seconds of an opera aria we hear as the power is flickering while irene is chasing benny through the house . it is of the famous aria " ebben ? . . . ne andrÃ² lontano " from catalani ' s opera " la wally " . the aria is sung by the lead soprano who is leaving home forever . as irene ' s mother was a dramatic soprano , we can guess that this is a recording of her singing and that she is saying a poignant farewell to her daughter , as in the movie irene is soon destined to never again see benny alive . i just have one minor question of the soundtrack , why include the famous tango yo soy maria ? i love the song and personally could hear it all the time , but it didn ' t really fit here .  another direct to video movie from disney , that is essentially perfect for the kids . the problem with kronk ' s new groove i find is that everything that made the first movie a fun great ride is replaced with a more sad and sombre film . in this movie , kronk learns a great deal of lessons at many others ' expenses . it takes away much time that could be spent at creating a more enjoyable film . 

kronk ' s new groove deals with two stories : yzma returns for payback and one ms . birdwell hopes to defeat kronk ' s camp counseling championship . this all leads up to kronk confronting his father and his disapproval over his son ' s direction in life . 

from lord of the rings to michael jackson ' s thriller , kronk ' s new groove recycles every bit of time that it allows to entertain its viewers . if you loved the original , or are looking forward to the upcoming tv series about kuzco , i recommend kronk to his loyal fans .  even though this was a well-told story , i found it too unpleasant . the main subject is child abuse , which is never fun to see - a sordid topic . add to that a lot of profanity by the drunker-abuser husband and a gd by a little kid , no less - and this movie turned me off as far as ever seeing it again . 

also portrayed in here were punks picking on the two little boys , another unpleasant viewing experience . the realism of the story takes a swan dive when one of the boys flies away on a home-made airplane ! give me a break ! 

the only positive , enjoyable part of this movie is seeing the nice , loving and touching relationship between the two young brothers , played by elijah wood and joseph mazello . the latter became a familiar face in the next couple of years with big roles in jurassic park , shadlowlands and the river wild . wood , of course , didn ' t hit it big until a decade later but , he made it very big in the lord of the rings trilogy . those two kids , and narration by an unbilled tom hanks , are the only facets of this film i liked .  somehow , i really thought that i was going to enjoy this film because i love pictures with mountain climbing and a great mystery in the plot . i must say that the photography was fantastic and there was some scary scenes that captured my attention . i thought that nicole eggert , ( diana pennington ) , " thank you , good night " , ' 01 played a very convincing role as a young girl who had a tragic loss in her life and meets up with some characters who want her to guide them up the mountain . marc singer , " angel blade " , ' 02 , played a very unconvincing weird guy and over acted in many scenes with a bad temper that looked comical . this film was a big disappointed and not worth watching , unless there is nothing on the tv to enjoy ! !  new york family is the last in their neighborhood to get a television set , which nearly ruins david niven ' s marriage to mitzi gaynor . bedroom comedy that rarely ventures into the bedroom ( and nothing sexy happens there anyway ) . gaynor as an actress has about as much range as an oven--she turns on , she turns off . film ' s sole compensation is a supporting performance by perky patty duke , pre- " miracle worker " , as niven ' s daughter . she ' s delightful ; " happy anniversary " is not . * from * * * *  in the mid 1800s , irishman dennis hopper ( as daniel morgan ) emigrates to australia , seeking a share of the continent ' s gold . instead , mr . hopper finds himself branded , and thrown in a torturous prison ; there , he is gang-raped . upon release , hopper hooks up with aborigine david gulpilil ( as billy ) , with whom he seeks revenge upon sadistic bill hunter ( as sergeant smith ) , jack thompson ( as detective mainwaring ) , and others . eventually , vengeance becomes heroism ; hopper is admired and assisted by the common people , and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities . hopper ' s " scarcely human " performance certainly fits the disjointed feel of the film . mr . gulpilil heads up a strong supporting cast . the personnel involved in " mad dog morgan " make it not only worth a look , but also a huge disappointment . 

 * * * mad dog morgan ( 1976 ) philippe mora ~ dennis hopper , david gulpilil , bill hunter daniel auteuil ' s bruno in petites couperes is a middle-aged model of his pierre in christian vincent ' s la separation of 10 years ago . in both films , youthful confidence in left-wing ideology and love ( mutual metaphors ) crumbles into paranoia - manifesting itself as trapped aggression in pierre and desperately comic womanizing in the more recent bruno . 

unfortunately for auteuil fans , the actor has become reliant on a uniform world-weariness ( not unlike compatriot johnny hallyday in leconte ' s recent l ' homme du train ) . acting it ain ' t , and becomes rather frustrating as the film progresses . pascal bonitzer doesn ' t help as the writer / director of the project . his sequencing of episodes overlaid with connecting symbolism fail to mask the film ' s lack of rhythm . i was particularly furious that the imposingly dramatic / romantic backdrops of grenoble were made virtually redundant by a cameraman who was obviously shivering in the cold . 

krisitn scott thomas almost rescues the show with her female counterpart to bruno , beatrice . she dramatizes the dizzying contradictions intended as bruno in a character of increasing complexity to the point of becoming surreal . bonitzer cannot sustain this though , and the flagging plot demands beatrice to even out into another bourgeois mannequin . in doing so bonitzer shows then denies scott thomas the oscar cabinet . 

all the characters ' submersion into the bourgeoisie may be a viable and indeed tragic outcome , but in this case it ' s a cop-out of a cadence ( unlike the brutal , painful denouement of la separation ) . a serious disappointment , 4 / 10 .  an ex- informant of the east germany finishes in mexico like spy of a student group in 1971 in where she falls in love with one of the activists . this is the first co-production of mexico with germany , and although it is a good picture of the ideals that marked , and continue marking ( at least to the cgh ) , youth , as much finishes being something insipid since to the internal dilemmas that it faces dark brown ( noethem ) like the passion by his ideals that adela feels ( campomanes ) , as soon as they glimpse , in the case of him , i want to suppose , by the barrier of the language ; and in the case of her by its lack of experience . reason why in the end a concrete identification with any of them does not exist , which causes that what could have been films that even served as document like red dawn , finished being one more a film ; although i want to clarify that in the room many of the assistants were excited in the conversation with the director , which says to me that no longer they are so young or my ideals have changed .  over acted , heavy handed , full of speeches , preachy , on the nose , and over stylized in a way only mtv could be guilty of , stop-loss is agit-prop garbage . i expected a lot more with talented young actors such as joseph gordon-levitt and ryan philippe , but screenwriter / director kimberly peirce does a hatchet job of portraying the ill effects of war on american youth . i ' m sure she did some work researching the iraq war and the young men fighting in it , but you ' d never guess it from watching stop-loss . in many ways this mess reminded me of catherine hardwicke ' s lords of dogtown , an equally inept , overly stylized , tv movie-like waste of solid subject matter . 

http : / / eattheblinds . blogspot . com /  a quick , funny coming-of-age matinÃ©e romp appealing to the underdog aldolescent in us all . it functions , in effect , as a vehicle for justin long who has subsequently erupted onto our screens in the fourth die hard via pc vs mac ads , dodgeball and the break up . he ' s funny , earnest and young - a big career ahead . 

a town ' s worth of college wannabes find a fake website bartelby ( long ) has set up to delude his judgemental parents and descend on the ' college ' like it were a short notice facebook party . lewis black summises the anarchic philosophy as a stand-in dean - long ' s delinquent friends provide support for the subterfuge and consequent appeal to grander traditions of education and friendship ( adam herschman deserves special mention for his never-flagging slapstick contribution ) . well executed , feelgood and instantly forgettable . 4 / 10 young michael dudikoff like young lord greystoke was abandoned in the jungle on a pacific island as an infant . but instead of being raised by the apes , he fell into the hands of a japanese soldier who was still living there because he hadn ' t heard the war was over . and like young luke skywalker it turns out he fell into the hands and learned the fighting skills of a ninja . 

good thing because they were separated and the young kid came down with a case of amnesia , but those fighting skills didn ' t go away . the orphaned kid , now named joe armstrong enlists in the army and gets himself stationed in the phillipines . meanwhile his obi wan kenobe played by john fujioka gets rescued himself and goes to work as a gardener on the estate of planter and terrorist go between don stewart using a cheesy accent that seems to vary between french and spanish . 

as these things happen everybody meets and dudikoff both solves the mystery of part of his past and saves the commanding officer ' s daughter from the bad guys in this golan-globus production . charles bronson was getting a bit long in the tooth now and golan-globus needed a new star for their action flicks . michael dudikoff filled the bill quite nicely and made quite a few films for them including several american ninja sequels . 

this film is all action and dudikoff dispatches bad guys at a record pace . what he doesn ' t do , steve james does doing his best rambo imitation and showing his considerable martial arts skills . 

the film has enough holes in the plot to drive one of those army vehicles through you see in the story . but that ' s what the ticket buying public doesn ' t care about . dudikoff certainly looks magnificent stripped to his fighting clothes . no wonder so many sequels were made .  this could have been the best game ever ! ! but the game makers just screwed up after 3 assassinations and the ending ! ! this is a combination of prince of persia , hit-man , gta and age of empires ii ( saladin ) . 

yes these four games mentioned above are considered to be one of the greatest games ever made . 

you combine the four and you get this game ! ! it has all the good aspects of the four games like acrobatic skills , stealth assassinations , open world and the history ! ! for the first 3 assassinations you feel this game is greatest ! ! but after the third , things seem to get so repetitive , that you only hope for the game to end . 

i have played this on a pc and the pc version is horrible with glitches and the stupid side missions are senseless . 

my advice to all . this is a good game but get it either for the xbox360 or ps3 . don ' t get it for the pc . 

lastly , this game came from the creators of prince of persia . surely the producer is hot , but the game is not hot and it is not better than the four games mentioned above ! !  the memory keeper ' s daughter in the form of a novel by kim edwards was a highly successful bestseller and probably was featured in more reading groups than any other novel during its circulation . so what happened when the novel became a made-for-television movie ? perhaps it is the below mediocre screenplay ( oops ! , teleplay ! ) by john pielmeier that consistently galumphs along in an awkward pedestrian fashion removing all sense of credibility to the story . perhaps it is the cut and paste direction by mick jackson that misses the pacing and character delineation . perhaps it suffers from the cinematography of an uncredited source or the ' liquid tears ' musical score by daniel licht . for whatever of these ( or all of these ) reasons , this novel-to-film survives because it does make a good case for educating the public about the capabilities of those born with down syndrome . and for that it is worthy of attention . 

dr . david henry ( dermot mulroney ) , a successful orthopedic doctor , is married to the beautiful norah ( gretchen mol ) and their lives are becoming changed by their pregnancy . on a stormy winter night in kentucky norah goes into labor and the henry ' s rush to a nearby clinic where david delivers his wife ( the doctor is caught in a snowstorm ) with the assistance of his old friend , nurse caroline gill ( emily watson ) . after the delivery of a perfect boy child ( paul ) norah continues to be in labor and ( surprisingly . . . ) delivers an unexpected ( ! ) twin girl . david and caroline immediately recognize that the little girl ( phoebe ) is a ' mongoloid ' ( this is before the use of the term down syndrome ) and david , having a history of losing a little sister because of a birth defect ) decides to send phoebe to an asylum for the mentally challenged : caroline is to make the delivery and norah is told the second twin died at birth . 

caroline follows instructions , sees the conditions of the ' home ' where phoebe is to be deposited , shrinks in horror , and decides to keep the child . aided by a friendly trucker , caroline changes her solitary existence and mothers phoebe , finding a new life in her trucker ' s pittsburgh . norah insists on a formal funeral for phoebe - a fact that deeply disturbs david ' s psyche , and the henry ' s life goes on with only the one child paul , leaving submerged pains about the lack of phoebe ' s presence . norah gifts david with a camera ( ' peoples lives are like a camera , that ' s where they live - in a room captured by a moment ' ) and david becomes obsessed with photography . norah grieves , drinks , and loses david ' s attention , while david traces phoebe ' s existence with caroline - sending money and letters to pittsburgh . paul ( tyler stentiford to jamie spilchuk ) grows up , discovers his mother ' s infidelities and is angered about his father ' s lack of communication and understanding , and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician , and off to juilliard he goes . meanwhile phoebe ( krystal hope nausbaum ) has matured into a very highly adapted young girl , and the manner in which the broken marriage of the henrys happens and the healing atmosphere of phoebe ' s and paul ' s lives coupled with the courage that has supported caroline gill ' s struggle to gain acceptance in the world for those born with down syndrome forms the conclusion of the film . 

the cast of well-known actors tries hard , but only emily watson is able to resurrect a credible character from this squishy script . jamie spilchuk gives evidence of a young actor with much promise . dermot mulroney and gretchen find it difficult to mold empathetic characters form the corny lines they are given to deliver . the film is a mess , but the message about acceptance of down syndrome children and adults is an important one . grady harp maniratnam , who in india , is often compared with prominent world film makers and is regarded a genius in film-making , has yet again proved that he can only make the frames look visually good , without offering much food for thought . forget about pure cinematic pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old form of art . 

while i would not like to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies made around the world , still any thoughtful and a bit educated film goer can identify that his films do not contain innovative ingenuous plots , does not contain lingering effects afterward and mostly contain ridiculous ending and a lot of melodrama , seen profusely in indian movies . 

overall , maniratnam has successfully confirmed my distaste for his films once again . 

sorry for those who on this board were claiming otherwise . my suggestion to you : watch some beautiful cinemas made around the globe .  child death and horror movies will always remain a sensitive & controversial combination and therefore it is my personal opinion that every movie that shows the courage to revolve on this topic should receive some extra attention from horror fans . of course , like in the case of " wicked little things " , controversial themes don ' t always guarantee a good film . despite the potentially interesting plot , the atmospheric setting and the involvement of video-nasty director j . s . cardone ( " the slayer " ) , this is an uninspired and clichÃ©-ridden film that couldn ' t offer a single fright or shock . after losing their husband and father , the remaining tunny women ( mother karen and her daughters sarah and emma ) move to a small and remote pennsylvanian mountain town where they inherited an old , ramshackle mansion . their new home is dangerously close to the old mine ruins where dozens of innocent children tragically lost their lives in 1913 . strange things start to happen , like young emma befriending an ( imaginary ? ) girl who used to live in their house , and the eerie locals seem to keep secrets from karen and her daughters . quickly turns out that the undead children still leave their mine-graves at night to seek vengeance on the descendants of the mine ' s owner mr . carlton , who was responsible for their deaths . " wicked little things " is rather tame and extremely predictable . the script shamelessly serves one dreadful clichÃ© after the other , like car wheels stuck in the mud at crucial times , malfunctioning flashlights and horridly broken dolls . there ' s very little suspense , even less gore and the make-up effects are disappointingly weak . the zombified children don ' t look menacing at all . actually , they all look like miniature versions of marilyn manson , with their black outfits , pale faces and dark eyes . the excitement-free finale is stupid and just as derivative as the rest of this pointless production . lori heuring is thoroughly unimpressive in her leading role as the mother , but scout taylor-compton ( currently a big star thanks to the " halloween " remake ) and young chloe moretz are adequate as the daughters .  a klutzy young man returns west after being schooled in the hotel business via boston ; he quickly learns his friends in spanish-colonized old california expect him to fill his deceased father ' s shoes instead--that of a romantic thief known for kissing his female victims after robbing them . colorful but silly m-g-m production has a great deal of talent before and behind the camera , but it never takes off . this might have been fun , second-string material for abbott & costello , but frank sinatra looks lost and embarrassed in the lead . combination of raucous comedy and musical interludes are hindered by the poor staging ( sinatra is photographed singing at one point in a mirror , but one doesn ' t concentrate on his performance so much as noticing how odd the star appears reflected in this way ! ) . kathryn grayson is the governor ' s daughter who falls for frank , and her high soprano trilling turns her singing scenes into self-parody . aside from robert surtees ' cinematography and the decent art direction , this " bandit " remains kissless . * from * * * *  while the twilight zone was a wonderful show , it was also very uneven--with some great episodes , some lousy ones and many in between . don ' t believe the die-hard fans--there were some stinkers and this was definitely one of them . 

in a plot that is obviously meant to be an attack on fidel castro , a near lookalike ( peter falk in lots of makeup and a beard ) obtains a magic mirror that allows him to realize who all his enemies are so he can liquidate them . while i do believe that castro is a thug and dictator ( and tens of thousands of refugees and political prisoners will attest to this ) , it ' s amazing how this sort of preachy episode actually makes audiences laugh at the american efforts to marginalize the creep and actually makes castro seem okay ! ! think about it--serling and company wanted to hurt castro but instead only seemed to be obvious , preachy and silly in the process . 

it ' s indeed bad--almost laughably bad when seen today .  a nicely evoked 1930s setting provides much interest for a viewer in the early 21st century ; unfortunately , " london belongs to me " has little else to recommend it besides lashings of quaint english charm . all of the problems rest with the deeply unfocused story . the main plot concerns the actions of young lad richard attenborough , the problems he gets into and how the community in which he lives bands together to save him from society ' s laws . or something . the main issue here is that attenborough ' s character brings everything upon himself and , quite frankly , is guilty of almost every accusation brought against him , so it ' s baffling why the film ( and all the characters ) have so much sympathy for him . he ' s treated as a victim of circumstance when he really , really isn ' t ; and what ' s more he isn ' t shown to have very much remorse for his actions , only caring about getting away with things he didn ' t mean to do . alastair sim gets a lot of screen time in a subplot that has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot line and you wonder what he ' s doing there ( though sim is , as always , superb ) . you know there ' s a problem with the structure when the main plot impacts constantly against the subplot but not vice-versa . and , following a sedate pace and a careful build up , the plot completely falls apart in the last 20 minutes with a deeply unsatisfying and unexplained conclusion which doesn ' t even show us if attenborough ' s character has developed at all from the previous proceedings . the film doesn ' t end , it just stops . 

the acting , direction and the general feel of the film can all be commended but unfortunately the story and structure of the piece jars constantly . a last point of trivia : alec guinness based his performance in the vastly superior film " the ladykillers " on alastair sim ' s performance in this film , right down to both the characters having almost identical first scenes .  rko was trying to boost its starlet joan fontaine when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong-willed enough to make a doctor ( john beal ) come to terms with running away from responsibilities in this little programmer . tcm aired it as a stepping-stone in the career of joan fontaine . 

fontaine is earnest and does an acceptable job , nothing more , and john beal is okay as her love interest . but it ' s obvious that philip huston ( who has the appearance and cocky manners of a young james garner ) is the actor who should have shared top billing with fontaine . whatever happened to this handsome actor ? why didn ' t rko promote him , along with fontaine ? he showed skill as a light comedian . 

these are the kind of thoughts that went through my head as i watched this rather tepid drama which never quite lives up to the stark promise of its title . the story itself is rather tiresome , only occasionally coming to life because of fontaine ' s spirited heroine . 

she photographs prettily as the nurse and wears her serious expressions skillfully , suggesting that there was more to be tapped at a future date . beal never did go on to a distinguished career and his performance here shows why . strictly lackluster . 

but whatever happened to philip huston ? evidence here is that he should have had a worthwhile film career . 

trivia note : watch for dwight frye ( of " dracula " ) as the out of control patient aboard the airplane .  it ' s schmaltzy , but then what else did you expect ? the heroine is cinderella ' s younger sister complete with wicked mother , sister , and brother-in-law ; the hero ( if you can call him that ) is an ineffectual putz ; and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic villainy . 

the cast , settings , and wardrobe were all very attractive , and i thought the actors did a superb job considering how weak the material was . the movie was prettily filmed and boasted a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to cue the viewer about what emotions he should be experiencing throughout . megon mcdonough sang sweetly and provided the film with some of its best moments . 

if you love danielle steel , you will love this film . if you love archetypal romance , you will love this film . i did not . i was able to sit through it , but it was close .  crystal voyager is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in australia . an american by birth george greenough has surfed and photographed himself , friends and recently , dolphins , in australia for 35 years , all using various re invented cameras which he either straps on his back , board or boat . in the mid 70s he teamed up with surf mag editor and budding film maker david elfick to create this visually interesting tale about this life and photography . the 75 minute feature crystal voyager is the result . even in the 70s audiences were a bit puzzled by this film , neither surf-ing movie nor surf movie , because george swims about on a children ' s zippy board , not a real surfboard . . . . it offset the tedious droning of george ( occasionally so dry or droll that it was actually funny . . like almost setting himself on fire or falling over something ) with a spectacular ' you are there ' power glide through a wave that ran for 23 minutes all set to pink floyd music . in 1974 when the sydney opera house opened , it also contained a cinema . crystal voyager was booked in there as an arty-sporty oz pic and by default became a hit : as the ' opera house tickets ' cost far more than a movie ticket , audiences flocked to see this film as an excuse to ' have been to the sydney opera house ' . . . so the film did record business as a low budget attraction to locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they had seen a show ' there ' . this created this myth that the film was a huge crowd puller and the reputation spread . as a result it was teamed with the fantasy cartoon fantastic planet and had a trippy run through the uk and europe as a double feature . i ran it at a coastal cinema in the 70s and the crowd was rather nonplussed about it all . recently george has re emerged lord of the flies style with another well photographed sea adventure called dolphin glide that offers viewers a dive and swim with the wild dolphins of byron bay . it is an eccentric 20 min short with an even more eccentric 20 min ' how george did it ' short . each were met with a collective yawn by both the media and the pubic in january 2005 . . . . all of which makes crystal voyager a ' you had to have been there ' fluke all those years ago . however at a special oz surf night at an outdoor cinema last year 2000 people turned up . . . . but then 2000 turn up every night to see anything there during this summer season of films . . . . . so the damned thing fluked another box office binge . how many actually enjoyed it is very much open to debate . again they were more than likely just plain puzzled by this mad film with an astonishing reputation . elfick however , since 1975 , has gone onto a stellar career as a major producer and director of many lauded australian and international films . look up no worries or starstruck or undercover or rabbit proof fence or love in limbo for clear and present applause at his achievements . george , however , is still floating around out there somewhere droning away and looking for something else to film , or drop a camera on .  rivalry between brothers leads to main story line . navy commander chuck prescott ( marshall thompson ) has developed the y12 aircraft to test how far man can go up in the atmosphere . his brother , lt . dan prescott ( bill edwards ) , seems to be the best test pilot around and is chosen to go up in the y12 . dan of course has a problem with taking orders and is also an over confident dare devil . 

on dan ' s second flight , he hits over the 300 miles up comfort zone and his craft passes through a meteor dust storm . returning to earth , dan becomes a monster that resembles 200 pounds of bad asphalt . he also has a demanding craving for blood , whether it be from farm animals or fellow human beings . 

short runtime of an hour and seventeen minutes ; black & white with near stoic acting . . . typical of low budget sci-fi . 

rounding out the cast is marla landi , robert ayers and carl jaffe . noteworthy trivia : about two months after this film was released ; the russians put the real first man in space .  lucille ball was a mighty power in television throughout the 1950s and 1960s , but she still made an occasional film , most notably the long , long trailer and the facts of life . although her television career remained strong , as the 1970s began her movie career seemed to be winding down--but ball was determined to have one last big screen fling , and the project she selected was the 1966 musical mame . 

in many respects the role seemed tailor-made : based on the popular novel which gave rise to two different broadway plays , mame dennis is a wacky , wildly uninhibited woman who " inherits " her orphaned nephew patrick--and leads him on a wild tour of life ' s possibilities , bouncing from one comic spree to another . the music , which featured such songs as " open a new window " and " if he walked into my life today , " was among jerry herman ' s best work . the supporting cast , which included robert preston and bea arthur , was the best of the best . expectations were high ; opening night fanfare was tremendous ; the film was a disaster . critics were aghast and audiences sat slack-jawed . 

no matter what hardcore lucy fans may say , mame is a fiasco , so much so that it is hard to know where to start . it is badly directed , badly filmed , badly performed , and there lucille ball is at the center of it all , unable to dance , unable to sing , and grinning like a waxworks dummy while incredibly bad choreography swirls around her . but the disaster is hardly of her making alone ; the supporting cast fares no better . bea arthur and jane connell recreate their stage roles of vera charles and agnes gooch ; the former is stagey , the latter is dismal . robert preston manages to sing with a smile , but he ' s pretty much on his own and clearly none too happy about it . 

the dvd brings the film from the vhs pan-and-scan release to widescreen , but that only means there ' s more awfulness to see . everybody loves lucy , but only the least critical fan could love lucy ' s mame ; while i wouldn ' t say it ' s bad enough to make you want to gouge your eyes out , you may wish you had . not recommended . 

gft , amazon reviewer it ' s another variation on the oft-told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of kids . with six you get egg roll is directed by howard morris ( from television ) and it shows , because it ' s the kind of tale that plays like a half-hour situation comedy padded out to feature film length--but with a scarcity of laughs , or to put it differently , only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the half-hour limits of a tv show . 

doris day decided to call it quits after this film--and it ' s rather easy to see why . even the presence of some fairly reliable actors in the cast doesn ' t help . brian keith , barbara hershey , pat carroll and alice ghostley do their best , but the script is the real problem and should have been left untouched for the big screen . 

nothing much can be said in favor of it . skip it and see miss day in any number of her more worthwhile films .  this was so bad i can ' t even review it . so i ' ll jot some sentences about what i witnessed , and it ' ll be up to you to decide . 

captain kirk , with toupee and tubby gut , is rock climbing yosemete ' s el capitan . spock meets him halfway riding on a floating skateboard-like hovercraft . kirk falls . spock flies down , catches him inches before kirk hits the ground head- first . 

later , that night , spock , kirk and mccoy are eating beans around a campfire . spock likes the beans . then , kirk and mccoy sing " row row row your boat " , and want spock to join in on the three-way harmony . spock doesn ' t want to sing . and later that night , he disagrees . " but life isn ' t but a dream , captain " . should i go on ? 

okay . . . a renegade vulcan , who happens to be spock ' s half brother , leads a revolt on a sandy planet - taking hostages . the crew of the enterprise land on the planet , and uhura , pushing fifty-five and weighing two-hundred some-odd pounds , lures the natives with her bare legs . but they can ' t trick the brother , who claims he can find god . 

he kidnaps the crew and the enterprise . they go to a planet where a big bearded apparition , claiming to be god , spits fire at kirk , spock , and mccoy . spock ' s sibling , realizing it isn ' t god - but is really a form of himself - or something - joins with the apparition in order to destroy it and . . . sparks fly . 

then , after stuff happens too complicated to explain involving klingons who resemble lorenzo lamas . . . 

the three amigos - kirk , spock and mccoy - return to yosemite ( did i mention , kirk was wearing a go climb a rock t-shirt ? ) . with spock playing some kind of funky vulcan guitar , they sing " row row row your boat " , this time all three harmonizing as the credits roll .  i saw this hallmark television movie when it originally aired . i lost interest in the story because a character was said to be a witch . i just was not in the right frame of mind to watch this film . but hallmark stands for the best , quality films . now , there is a reason to give this film a second look . clive owen who plays " damon wildeve " just might have a chance to be selected as the next james bond 007 when pierce brosnan passes it on . clive owen might have to wait until the year 2008 . the other reason is the female lead is catherine zeta-jones is now a celebrity ( she was an unknown at the time ) and became an academy award winner for outstanding supporting actress in 2003 . joan plowright as " mrs . yeobright " is also in this film . i like the opening line in this film : " deliver my heart from this fearful , lonely place . send me a great love from somewhere or else i shall die , truly i shall die . "  i finally rented this video after searching for it for many months . initially i only wanted to see it because i ' m an out and out neil pearson fan ( patrick , boyfriend of isobel , the lead ) . however , the movie stands up very well without neil ( although he handles himself very well in this movie , he is overshadowed by the three main female characters ) . it ' s an eerie , intense movie , the sort the brits do so well - definitely a " chick flick " the house and it ' s isolated setting giving the movie an almost " wuthering heights " aura . the movie is full of tension and the ending , shocking , yet somehow inevitable . i ' m glad i watched it , it was worth the wait  * * black dragons ( 1942 ) william nigh ~ bela lugosi , joan barclay , clayton moore 

 " just prior to the start of world war ii , dr . melcher ( bela lugosi ) , a world-famous surgeon , is brought in by japan ' s black dragon society as part of a secret plan . dr . melcher operates on six black dragon society operatives and transforms them into exact duplicates of 6 high ranking american businessmen who are replaced by these look-alikes . with their operatives in place , the black dragon society ' s plan to sabotage the american war effort appears to be set but , the f . b . i . chief and an agent begin to piece together the clues that hopefully uncover this sinister plot , " according to the dvd sleeve ' s synopsis . 

that synopsis gives away the entire ending ; which , in this case , might be a good thing . " black dragons " is an incredible , wildly inconsistent muddle . a wiser course of action would have been to stay with the teasing supernatural angle . in early scenes , mr . lugosi ( as monsieur colomb ) is effectively creepy . confusing joan barclay ( as alice saunders ) , future " lone ranger " clayton moore ( as dick martin ) , along with a cast of old stage and silent veterans do the best they can with a story that looks as if filmmakers were making it up as they went along .  marlene dietrich is magnificent as concha perez , the temptress who drives all men to despair in josef von sternberg ' s " the devil is a woman " . her performance has nothing to do with ' acting ' in any conventional sense but she ' s incandescent , a true star in full command of her material . but she ' s the only good thing about the film , ( she ' s so good she keeps you watching this dross ; i doubt if any other actress could have done the same ) . 

the story is an appallingly lame melodrama , ( surely pierre louys ' novel was better ) , in which dietrich ' s amoral concha ruins the lives of two friends played by lionel atwill and cesar romero with a stiffness bordering on petrification . and for von sternberg it ' s an ugly looking movie , ( maybe in keeping with its fairly ugly subject matter ) . bunuel , on the other hand , thought enough of it to remake it as " that obscure object of desire " with a greater emphasis on the surrealist aspects of it all , down to casting two different actresses in the same role . neither film is either director ' s finest hour and while the bunuel version may be the better film , it is dietrich ' s ' performance ' you remember .  this version of mansfield park , while being extremely accurate to the novel lacked the compassion i felt for fanny which is crucial and central to this jane austen story . this was due to the total lack of acting ability by the actress , sylvestra le touzel . she had no appeal and at times appeared to be either lost in space or out of her depth . the scene she has with her uncle where she breaks down in hysterics was hysterical . she badly overplayed that crucial scene and i actually felt sorry that henry crawford ever cared for her . 

the polar opposite is the portrayal of mary crawford by jackie smith- wood . what a wonderful actress , in a very difficult part to make that character witty and self-centered , selfish yet vulnerable to love . 

i have always loved fanny . she is mild mannered but with an implacable sense of what is right , and who she thinks is worthy of respect and admiration . the fanny in this adaptation is too meek and subservient with hardly a thought of her own until near the end of the series . as much as i wanted to like this fanny . . . . i just could not . 

i suggest skipping this version of mansfield park for the real thing . . . the novel . fanny will not disappoint . . . you will love her !  rocketship x-m should be viewed by any serious movie buff for the following reasons : 

1 ) it is one the first -- and the few -- movies not to have a happy ending . doubtless the effect was more profound in post-world war ii america than it would be today , but nonetheless the sad ending adds to the film ' s message . 

2 ) it is also one of the first movies to deal with space travel in a serious fashion , using space as a valid setting for drama . the lack of scientific background notwithstanding , the movie stands on its own as dramatic fare . it ' s not so much a space drama as it is a drama set in space . 

3 ) the anti-nuclear war message is delivered in a serious manner that is not lost in sfx involving large grasshoppers , men , or animal . the effect of martian society from nuclear devastation is starkly and frankly presented . the fact that the survivors from the expedition crash land and as such are unable to preach the lesson learned on mars adds another element of sadness to the tragic ending . 

sterno says take a ride on rocketship x-m .  before hitting international acclaim with the silence of the lambs , director jonathan demme cut his teeth making quirky comedies . this was one of them and like quite a few oscar winning american comedies i could mention , it has a fine concept , is well paced , has great performances , a complicated romance . but it just simply isn ' t very funny . pfeiffer is mob widow who moves to the city backwaters after her husband ( baldwin ) is murdered . the crime boss who killed him ( stockwell ) takes a fancy to pfeiffer , his wife ( reuhl ) is furious and to complicate matters pfeiffer also falls for the cop who is trailing her . all of this should have been a laugh a minute . pfeiffer , sporting a hefty wig is excellent as the widow , as is the hyperactive ruehl and modine is good too as the nice cop . but the script is simply devoid of one-liners , wit , humour or punch lines of the verbal or physical kind that this kind of film demands . the result is it raises smiles at best rather than guffaws . it oozes charm , but is tediously short on humour .  the stranger jack ( matthew lillard ) arrives in the studio of the crook collector of antiques max ( vincent d ' onofrio ) and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in poisons jamie ( valeria golino ) that he is jack ' s brother . jamie does not buy his story , dominates jack and ties him up to a chair . when max arrives , jack proposes us $ 100 , 000 . 00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiques " spanish judges " with a wealthy and dangerous collector . max invites his stupid acquaintance piece ( mark boone junior ) , who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from mars , to compose the backup team . however , jack double-crosses the collector and then he intrigues jack , jamie and piece . 

the low budget " spanish judges " is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast . valeria golino is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor vincent d ' onofrio , they are not able to save the stupid story . further , the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work , and actually they are silly and not funny . my vote is three . 

title ( brazil ) : " tudo por dinheiro " ( " all for money " )  this film has the language , the style and the attitude down . . . plus greats rides from occy ( a world champ ) and the great jerry lopez . john philbin as turtle has the surf pidgin down , and the surfing scenes are still the best ever . a true classic that can be seen many times . nia peeples is a babe , and laird hamilton shows the early stuff that has made him the world ' s number one extreme surfer .   ' the mill on the floss ' was one of the lesser novels by mary ann evans , who wrote under the male pseudonym george eliot . i tried to read this dull and very turgid novel years ago , but was unable to finish it . i ' ll review this film version solely on its own merits , as i don ' t know how faithfully it follows the original novel . 

the film ' s opening credits are printed in an old english typeface that suggests the mediaeval period , and so it ' s a very poor choice for a film with a 19th-century setting . ( on the other hand , about halfway into the film , we see a close-up shot of a handbill advertising an estate auction . this handbill is set in authentic victorian type fonts , and looks * very * convincing . ) most of this film is extremely convincing in its depiction of the architecture and clothing of early 19th-century england . the precise location of this film ' s story is never disclosed , but - judging by the actors ' accents - i ' d place it as somewhere in the cotswolds , perhaps warwickshire . 

the plot , what there is of it , involves a mill that changes hands a couple of times ( over a couple of decades ) between two rival families , one wealthy and one working-class . i disagree with another imdb reviewer who claims that james mason has only a small role in this film . mason has the largest and most central role in this drama , as the scion of the wealthier family . as the spoilt and petulant tom tulliver , mason is darkly brooding and impetuous . his performance here belongs in a better film : it made me want to see ' wuthering heights ' recast with mason as heathcliff . 

as this is a multi-generational saga ( something which george eliot did much better in ' middlemarch ' ) , several of the main roles in this film are split among two actors apiece : child actors in the prologue , adults in the main narrative . the prologue of this film features a very well-written scene , establishing tom tulliver as wilful and bully-ragging from an early age , and young philip wakeham as decent and thoughtful . through hard labour , philip has earned a halfpenny : tom tries to bully it away from him , but is unwilling to take the coin by brute force : he wants philip to * give * it to him . all the child actors in this movie , male and female , are talented and attractive . unfortunately , all of the children speak their dialogue in posh plummy-voiced accents that are utterly unlike the accents of the actors and actresses who play those same roles as adults . this discrepancy calls attention to the staginess of the material . regrettably , none of the later scenes are as good as this prologue . 

the climax features a crowd of labourers in a rainstorm , much better paced and photographed than the earlier scenes . but modern viewers ( in britain , at least ) can no longer take this sort of material seriously . by now , practically every british comedian has done a " trouble at t ' mill , squire " comedy routine , parodying precisely this subject matter , so i had difficulty watching this movie with a straight face . 

the character actress martita hunt is good in a small role , but the opening credits ( in that old english typeface ) misspell her forename as ' marita ' . i ' ll rate this dull movie 3 points out of 10 : one point apiece for james mason ' s performance , the early scene with the children , and the authentic victorian typesetting in that auctioneer ' s handbill .  my mom and i went to see this film because my brother is serving in the u . s . peace corps in the same region in which it ' s set . halfway through the film , i decided that given its failure to measure up to what it pretends to accomplish , the title is pretentious . the subject it deals with could have made for an excellent documentary , but because of its poor execution , it left me far less educated about the issue than i had hoped to become . i agree with laura-jane from canada ( " powerful message but lacks focus . " ) . i also agree with the user who commented that this filmmaker ' s narration-free style is the opposite of that of michael moore , but i don ' t agree that it presents varying points of view and invites the viewer to decide for him- or herself . i do agree with one user ' s comment that " a lesson is better learned when we draw the conclusions ourselves " ; however , our conclusions can ' t be anything but poorly founded if we are presented with little relevant information from which to draw them . 

the main points of the documentary seemed to be that 1 ) the african people who live near lake victoria are very poor and suffer greatly . 2 ) the introduction of perch to lake victoria , inflicted by europeans , ruined its ecosystem . 3 ) the communities surrounding lake victoria are financially dependent on the perch economy . 

the best things i can say about the film is that it attempted to relate the perspectives of the average people in sub-saharan africa , which , unfortunately , is an anomaly among films , and that it attempted to portray poverty as the result of a dysfunctional economic system rather than a universal , inevitable phenomenon . i liked the irony it captured in the massive amount of fish leaving the country in the face of a famine . i appreciated the portrayal of how out of touch the u . n . team assigned to the region was with the people . like almost all documentaries that don ' t have the word " women " in the title , this film fails to do a good job representing women ' s voices -- the majority of the talking done in interviews is that of men . 

maybe i need to watch the film a second time in order to catch some key points i might have missed , but i failed to detect sauper ' s theory of the relationship between the introduction of perch to lake victoria and the unjust living conditions for africans living near the lake . furthermore , i could be wrong , but it struck me that sauper could do well to improve his interview skills . not only did the questions he asked and the responses he included seem to be arbitrary , but he seemed to have a real knack for making interviewees awkward and uncomfortable . 

the most compelling development in the film is the suggestion that the exportation of perch now functions to mask the importation of arms and that the real economy screwing over tanzanians is that of war , not fishing . sadly , sauper shies away from conducting a thorough expose of the idea ( or at least extending the interview with the reporter who seemed to know what he was talking about in regards to the weapons importation ) and cops out with a " decide for yourself " approach . 

if darwin ' s nightmare was meant to dispel the myth that first world exploitation of the third world gives them " a chance for a better life , " it didn ' t do a good job of it . if it was meant to depict how the weapons manufacturing industry in the u . s . and europe is responsible for much armed conflict around the world , it didn ' t do a good job of it . if it was meant to portray what drives people to prostitution , it didn ' t do a good job of it . if it was meant to cast light on the inability of the u . n . to carry out its mission , it didn ' t do a good job of it . if it was meant to say that meager income tanzanians earn from the perch isn ' t worth the human cost of tinkering with mother nature to create a profitable product , it didn ' t do a good job of it . if it was meant to imply that tanzania would be much better off had europeans never come , it didn ' t do a good job of it .  i know this film was shown on local tv when i was a kid , but i can ' t remember whether i watched it or not ; seeing it now , considering how utterly forgettable it is , i still don ' t know Â so i counted it as a first viewing ! there have been several films featuring the title character , a creation of visionary french author jules verne ; these include : 20 , 000 leagues under the sea ( 1954 ; with james mason in the role ) , master of the world ( 1961 ; vincent price ) , mysterious island ( 1961 ; herbert lom ) , captain nemo and the underwater city ( 1969 ; robert ryan ) and the mysterious island of captain nemo ( 1973 ; omar sharif ) . 

this version stars academy award winner jose ' ferrer . however , even if the premise itself isn ' t half-bad Â awakened from suspended animation in his submarine , " the nautilus " , and finding himself in modern times , nemo adopts all his ingenuity to aid the u . s . navy in defeating megalomaniac scientist burgess meredith Â it emerges as easily his most infantile adventure yet ! for instance : five seconds into the film , meredith ' s assistant Â donning a steel mask Â rants that " the world shall be ours ! " ) ; equally hilarious are the zealous gesticulations of the similarly decked-out midget , whose task it is to fire the professor ' s all-important " delta beam " - and how about those android-type minions aboard meredith ' s vessel who never seem to do much of anything ? ! 

ferrer manages to maintain his dignity throughout , but meredith is an embarrassment ( in what is virtually a retread of his penguin characterization from the 1960s batman tv series and film ) where the budget was so tight Â mostly invested in bland production design and shoddy special effects , no doubt , and both evidently influenced by star wars ( 1977 ) Â that , apparently , they couldn ' t even afford him a decent costume ( he looks positively idiotic wearing a tie in a sub ) ! the supporting cast includes mel ferrer ( playing a saboteur in the vein of joan fontaine from another irwin allen production , voyage to the bottom of the sea [1961] , and who engages in a swashbuckling routine with his namesake inside the engine-room of " the nautilus " ) , lynda day george ( unsurprisingly , she ' s the only female character around ) and horst buchholz ( as the king of atlantis Â for whatever reason , nemo is obsessed with locating the famed lost continent ) . 

by the way , having been reduced from a three-part mini-series for theatrical exhibition , the film obviously feels choppy Â though one is still able to discern where one episode ended and another began .  macbeth is one of the most frequently told stories in cinema and has been translated many times in numerous theater and celluloid settings . originally written by william shakespeare in the early 1600 ' s , macbeth tells the story of betrayal among royalty and one man ' s quest for power . director geoffrey wright ( romper stomper ) tries his hand at updating macbeth by setting it in the contemporary melbourne underworld . a film where the characters substitute swords for guns ( ala baz luhrman ' s romeo and juliet ) and royal vassals for gangsters , macbeth is a gritty , violent , but critically flawed film . 

macbeth ( sam worthington ) works for king duncan ( gary sweet ) . after being elevated to the thane of glamis by the king ( as was prophesied to macbeth by three witches ) , macbeth starts setting his eyes on the throne . one night the king comes to stay at macbeth ' s house and lady macbeth ( victoria hill ) talks him into killing the king to assume power . macbeth kills his master and then assumes his crown . but success has it ' s downside , as macbeth soon finds out , when he has to go to hideous lengths to protect his murderous secret . 

ok , first things first . the film ' s major fault is sam worthington . his portrayal of macbeth is in a word . . . boring . i honestly didn ' t care about macbeth while watching the film . i had more sympathy for victoria hill ' s lady macbeth because she bothered to act at least . worthington sits sullen and wood faced throughout the entire film . i felt like he was doing his best impression of johnny deep ' s george jung character from blow . . . but without the charisma . i have never seen worthington in a film before so i ' m not sure if it was his or the director ' s fault , but either way the glue that should have tied everything together into one cohesive unit is weak . 

the dialog is good , but when matched up to the geoffrey wright ' s australian gangster motif seems a bit out of place . frentically paced action sequences mixed with long shaksperian musings creates pacing conflict within the film . i understand that this is macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialog intact . but hard , fast action scenes following a three minute soliloquy tends to get annoying if not a bit pretentious . 

the camera-work is highly stylized , and for the most part , it works well . one thing that i found annoying was how the camera would slowly jostle back and forth , almost constantly . i don ' t mind shots like that it ' s just overdone . it ' s passes beyond the realm of being cool and stylish and instead becomes irritating . other than that , the art direction and cinematography is fairly well-done . 

for all of the good qualities macbeth possesses ; stylish direction , shakespearian dialog , a strong soundtrack , supernatural nude witches ( the weird sisters ) , and good helpings of brutal , bloody violence . all of these strengths are forgotten when one considers sam worthington ' s uninspired portrayal of macbeth . the role of macbeth was essential for tying everything together and in this respect geoffrey wright and sam worthington failed miserably , making macbeth a forgettable foray into shakespeare .  so this guy goes into a psychiatrist ' s office for his first appointment . after the paperwork is done , the psychiatrist says " i ' m going to show you ink blots . tell me what you see in them . " " well , says the patient , " looking at the first one , " i see a man and a woman having sex . " on seeing the second one , he says " i see two women having sex . " on seeing the third , he says " i see two men having sex . " on seeing the next one , he says " i see two men and two women having sex . " the psychiatrist puts down the the inkblots . " so , " he says , " we ' ll start by discussing your monomania . " " my monomania ? " says the guy . " and you with all these dirty pictures ! " that ' s how this movie strikes me .  admirable but weak james bond film mainly because both the hero ( bond ) and villain ( blofeld ) were seriously miscast . lazenby is too big and innocent looking to play bond . he looks and acts more like the good-natured but dim-witted sidekick in a police action movie . the director and writer try to establish his credibility , but his saying of lines like " royal baluga , north of the . . . " just aren ' t effective in establishing him as this worldly and suave rogue . savalas doesn ' t do a bad job , but his characterization and behavior is more fitting of a mob gangster . the best portrayed characters of the movie are those of tracy and her father . but the performances by those actors when sharing the screen with lazenby only serve to emphasize his deficiencies as an actor . this movie is too long ( 140 mins . ) for a bond film and doesn ' t offer any excitement until bond ' s mountain escape , where it begins to pick up . this film tries very hard , but falls short . many bondian elements are present and the climatic battle is top notch , but i always get a sense of something missing when watching this one .  scenarist frederick fox ' s sometimes memorable dialogue and a study cast of old-pros cannot save this lukewarm western about whites pinned down in the desert by a band of bloodthirsty cheyenne indians . other than his occasionally catchy dialogue , you won ' t find any surprises in fox ' s screenplay about this run-in between whites and indians . the characters in " dakota incident " generate only minor interest , certainly not enough to make them stand-out as much as some of fox ' s choice dialogue . unfortunately , good dialogue is fox ' s only contribution because this conventional little sagebrusher withers with a lackluster ending that contradicts its previous 80 minutes . the ending is as contrived as they come and lacks credibility . most of the characters are sympathetic , but some just plain lack common sense . 

dale robertson is appropriately tough and leathery as outlaw john banner , one of three bank robbers who has to shoot it out with his low-down , no-account partners . veteran western character actor john doucette ( rick largo ) fares the best of the badmen , while skip homeier , wasted in an inconsequential role as banner ' s brother frank banner , later dies from an indian arrow . doucette tries to gun down banner at the outset of in the action , but our left-handed gun-toting hero fakes his own death , tracks down largo down later and slaps leather with him in a town called christian flats . naturally , largo bites the dust this time , but banner makes an interesting discovery . one of the passengers on a stagecoach from christian flats to laramie turns out to be none other than the bank teller from whom he stole the money . not only is john carter ( john lund ) on a quest himself to find banner , but also he wants to clear his own good name with the bank that has issued wanted posters for his arrest . evidently , the authorities have mistaken and enlarged carter ' s role in the robbery . carter is prepared to take banner to laramie and turn him over to the law , but banner has other ideas about laramie . banner ' s ideas change when he crosses paths with amy clarke ( former twentieth century fox beauty linda darnell ) who wears a bright red dress and still packs quite a bosom . as everybody else here has mentioned in their reviews , republic studio ' s truecolor brings out the red in everything , from darnell ' s fetching outfit to the blood spilled on the ground . the problem with director lewis foster ' s handling of this run-of-the-mill oater is that everything bogs down after the stagecoach loses a wheel and our heroes hole up in a dry wash to defend themselves against the cheyenne . the good guys and the cheyenne eventually run out of ammunition , but " dakota incident " never runs out of clichÃ©s . ward bond has several interesting moments as a politically correct politician who defends the way of the redskin . by the time that this 88 minute dust-raiser concludes , you ' ll feel like you ' ve been trapped in a gulch and menaced by marauding cheyenne yourself .  on assignment in scenic italy , beautiful lip-synching lana turner ( as fredda barlo ) meets older singer and prince ezio pinza ( as mr . imperium ) . the two fall in love , while enjoying the pretty italian countryside . unhappily , mr . pinza is called away to his kingly father ' s death bed , leaving lana in the lurch . twelve years later , ms . turner is a los angeles actress , about to make a motion picture about falling in love with a king . turner is being romanced by co-star barry sullivan , who wants to marry her - then , king pinza re-enters her life 

 " mr . imperium " provides a tired storyline for sex symbol turner and debuting bass vocalist pinza , who appeared for several decades with the new york metropolitan opera . pinza likely earned his mgm feature film career after appearing in the hugely successful stage production of " south pacific " ( 1949 ) . the cast album , and pinza ' s golden " some enchanted evening " single , sold millions . supporting casters marjorie main , cedric hardwicke , and debbie reynolds give the film a even greater sense of wasted resources . 

 * * * mr . imperium ( 1951 ) don hartman ~ lana turner , ezio pinza , barry sullivan in a not totally successful attempt to be taken seriously , and move into ' adult ' films , mr . hughes gives us this film about a young married couple . true , it ' s got every cliche in the book in it , silly fantasy stuff and all that , but more importantly- it ' s got elizabeth mcgovern . 

clearly the best actress to have ever appeared in a john hughes film , she lends a weight to it that elevates the sometimes silly material . kevin bacon ( and his hair ) is pretty good as her husband , but mcgovern steals the movie with her quiet true moments of honesty . the ' teen film ' fun that worked so well in other hughes films falls flat here- like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9 , but keeps telling them when you are 15 and you wish he ' d find some new material . but i keep going back to mcgoverns performance , because it ' s truly moving . mr . hughes most interesting films to me have real actors in them ( some kind of wonderful , breakfast club ) and when his material bumps up against a true talent , some wonderful things can happen . if only he ' d trust that it doesn ' t have to be tarted up with the silly fantasy stuff .  explores the frontiers of extreme boredom . life in a small canadian town in winter as an experiment in extreme sensory deprivation . absolutely nothing happens as viewed through the eyes of a blank , deadpan , totally uninteresting protagonist . viewers of this film should be prepared to hallucinate in the style of " altered states " . 

in a groundbreaking study , david snowden found that he could predict alzheimer ' s thirty years in advance by comparing the autobiographical essays of nuns as they entered the convent . those who eventually suffered the disease wrote in simple direct prose . the essays were quiet and contemplative with little optimism or episodes of joy . 

now , why did i mention that ? perhaps , my mind begins to slowly unravel watching this interminable , autobiographical , contemplative film which shows , in simple direct style , the bleak and stoic life of a small community , living next to giant slag heaps of asbestos . 

this film became popular at the height of the quebec separatist movement because of its presentation of this community as permanently wounded victims . tragically , its writer-director was soon diagnosed with alzheimer ' s disease in the early 1980s and apparently committed suicide .  the war in the east , as the germans referred to the ww2 soviet-nazi conflict , was a war of annihilation on the part of the germany . 90 % of the german army were in the soviet union fighting . their ultimate aim was to wipe out the so called " sub human ( untermensch ) " russian population and colonize the mainly empty country with german settlers after they had won . 

read " hitler ' s willing executioners . " 

here we have the german army presented as innocent victims and not as nazi mass murderers . when are modern german film makers going to be honest and face up to the past ? 

better see the russian film " come and see " instead !  whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in himesh ' s head , which is always hidden under a cap , covering almost half of his face all the time ? only hope this is first and the last as well , for god ' s sake ! from assalam valekum to gayatri mantra , himesh has tried every thing , to create an aura of his so-called singing talent , which is nothing but atrocious pronunciations of words like tanhaiyya , which completely kill the beauty of the terms , so commonly used for love songs . why does himesh not smile ? simple , because he does not use close up toothpaste ! now there this friend of his , tailing him around every where , and this number one lawyer in the town , who has to herself sexily wiggle and try to seduce himesh , of all the handsome german people she might have met earlier , perhaps the male lawyers on this part of the world might be cursing their fate , for destined to deal with the stiff , unattractive lot , every day ! the action scenes are so funnily shot , like the event planner attacked by the thief , autos riding over the cars , so on and so forth . the father of the bride seems to be in a great hurry to get rid of his daughter by marrying her off , that he flies to and fro around . most hypocrite , he praises hr for distributing love among people of the world , as if they were sweets , and on his back , coolly gives a lecture to his daughter on these show business men . when himesh is proved innocent , he again unceremoniously dumps the other guy , as if it ' s a game of musical chair ! i didn ' t get to se the poor guy ' s face even , did you ? hansika in the role of ria , looks as if she is in need of an eye check up , for strain in her eyes ! the fellow in the role of a friend is good , who has acted quite naturally , and should be in better movies , like sharman joshi , for example . child artist in trishu ' s brief appearance is sweet , but wasted . it seems today ' s young generation has gone nuts , since they prefer this kind of mockery of lyrics and musical scores , and associate gossip with it , for example , if you sing ek bar aaja , the ghost would come . this is a weird taste in music , and rather funny . i am surprised , how such classic lyricists like gulzar , have opted for himesh of all the people , to give music . there is story in panchtantra , that a crow attachÃ©s so many feathers of a peacock , to look beautiful , and appeal to the birds ; but the feathers fall off ultimately , and the real dark crow is revealed ! hope himesh takes a hint , and refrains from manufacturing such meaningless stuff , and wasting precious money , which he has earned by taxing his short nose so much ! his friend does tell him , if your nose is cut , how will you sing ? thanks for showing us germany , himesh , at a reasonable cost of renting the dvd ! and correct those spelling mistakes , will you ? an extra e in movie , and no e in love ! there is also a famous number from the old film sholey , mehbooba , on which mallika sherawat wiggles , once again , but this time with himesh , winking at her , and conveniently , ria , his so-called real love , and his new bride is not around ! now that was very clever , himesh ! at least one thing in this movie which you have done smartly , to justify sherawat ' s presence . but doesn ' t she look a bit washed down ?  a professional production with quality actors that simply never touched the heart or the funny bone no matter how hard it tried . the quality cast , stark setting and excellent cinemetography made you hope for fargo or high plains drifter but sorry , the soup had no seasoning . . . or meat for that matter . a 3 ( of 10 ) for effort .  this movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town . i now have many friends who are guards at dixon correctional , and i myself worked for 3 yrs at the superamerica store next to the krogers store the old lady was at . however , this is still the dumbest movie ever made , destined to be introduced by gilbert godfreid or rhonda shearer , if it hasn ' t been already . a bit of trivia , illinois doesn ' t even have parole hearings , and dixon prison is a medium security facility housing burglars and vending machine vandals . the classic clucking / seduction scene is perhaps the most amusing piece of writing i ' ve ever seen , especially with the suspenseful build-up brief marital infidelity comes back to haunt loving wife grace needham ( portrayed by the always sexy nastassja kinski ) . 

she had left town , and her depressing husband , to embark on a trip to sunny miami , where she was pursued and ultimately seduced by julian grant , a handsomely evil and manipulative business executive , who is portrayed very well by william baldwin ( why do all of the baldwin brothers play evil people so damn well ? ) 

the seducing of grace took place as the two drank champagne on a deserted beach they reached privately by sailboat . grace admitted she drank too much for her own good and revealed the many problems in her marriage . julian gained her confidence by claiming he would never allow those types of problems to occur , if he had a relationship with grace . julian ' s manipulation continued as he described a " lost at sea " fantasy involving the now uninhibited grace , who sat near , listening to his every word and becoming more and more engaged with his romantic dream . 

his manipulation paid off as a few subtle nudges led to grace ' s soft kisses , paused momentarily by her pulling back as if suddenly thinking to herself `what am i doing ? i ' m a wife . i ' m a mother . i have a real life . real responsibilities . sure , the two of us have talked about being together , lost at sea , but that is just a fantasy . look at what we ' re doing here . the consequences are real . we ' re really alone on a secluded beach . am i going to let this fantasy really happen ? ' 

she succumbs to the dream , as her kisses became more passionate . the once guarded grace , who used to respond to men ' s propositions by saying " i ' m married " enjoyed watching as julian unbuttoned her shirt , leading to more kisses , body caresses and her climbing onto julian ' s lap ! she smiles , kisses , moans , laughs and frequently looks up at the sun throughout what unfortunately was a brief love-making scene in which everybody seemed to have most of their clothes on . 

while i thoroughly enjoyed the look of illicit passion on grace ' s face as the once devoted wife was being thoroughly satisfied by having sex with a man that clearly enjoys manipulating others , i will say that on the whole , the scene was undeserving of the movie ' s " r " rating . 

julian returned home to find her husband rejuvenated from his securing of a high paying job , and she is excited about being able to return to a normal life where she can once again be a loving wife and caring mother . 

but the evil julian grant reenters the picture and is not willing to give up so easily on grace . grace has a plan to rid her life of julian , but will it work ? 

obviously , i don ' t want to ruin the remaining story line for you . however , i will say that i always enjoy movies involving sexual pretense by a wife ( especially when she exhibits uninhibited attraction and behavior that is normally reserved for her husband ) but in actuality , is seeking revenge against the antagonist . this movie would have been much , much better if the movie had included more of that in the story line . my feelings are if the movie brings it up , then the movie should finish it . and this movie definitely brought it up . unfortunately , certain constraints in the story line prevented this from being significantly pursued . there are many other movies available that succeed with that very point , and i ' ll include their titles in the " recommendations " portion of this section . i ' m also open to receiving emailed suggestions of other movies that contain a good story line involving sexual pretense on the part of a seemingly devoted wife . 

overall , nastassja kinski and william baldwin are both very good . the movie is not .  computer savvy john light ( as john elias ) goes from stanford drop-out to successful young dotcom-era tycoon . but , mr . light ' s sneering success could be short-lived , with partners like ambitious jeffrey donovan ( as robert jennings ) . mr . donovan used to bed down with light ' s girlfriend , megan dodds ( as lisa forrester ) . donovan wants light to know that binge drinking and casual sex don ' t have to end in college . after reading a naughty internet sex session , ms . dodds shines light on . he may lose is " digital dreams " internet empire , too ! veterans unsuccessfully trying to lending dramatic gravitas include red lollipop-sucking mia farrow ( as anna simmons ) and quick-drawing , computer-hating hal holbrook ( as tom walker ) . ms . farrow looks sweet with her lollipops . 

 * * * purpose ( 2 / 21 / 02 ) alan lazar ~ john light , jeffrey donovan , mia farrow the real star of the last of the airport films is that big supersonic carrier the french created called the concorde . if you bear in mind that the whole film is dedicated to showing what that needle nosed plane could do in the sky , than the whole film kind of makes sense . 

but if you ' re expecting some serious drama here , than by all means take some of the evasive action the concorde shows here when some nasty folks try to shoot her down . 

susan blakely plays a television news reporter who also happens to be the mistress of military industrial tycoon robert wagner . one of wagner ' s aides just happens to bring her information on some of wagner ' s dirty business dealings , selling arms to folks not friendly to the usa . when the source , macon mccalman , is killed in front of her and she ' s nearly done in by a hit-man whom she escapes from of course she confronts wagner with the information . and of course he denies it . but right before blakely boards the concorde , mccalman ' s widow kathleen maguire hands her the necessary documents . 

but on the way to moscow with a stop in paris , wagner and his minions try to put the big bird down . but the fearless crew of alain delon , david warner , and george kennedy is up to all their tricks . it ' s quite a bag full as you ' ll see if you want to watch the film . 

if you ' re an aviation enthusiast , you absolutely won ' t care about the plot . it ' s like the film le mans with steve mcqueen which has a legion of auto racing fans who have made it a cult item . maybe le mans is better at that because they just didn ' t bother with any kind of story . 

among the passengers is a pot smoking saxophonist played by jimmie walker , a distraught mother accompanying a new heart for her child , played by cicely tyson and martha raye a woman with a weak bladder who spends the entire trip from washington to paris in the loo . she ' s actually the best one here . 

robert wagner must have been psychic though because i ' m sure on the strength of this film he got the part of doctor evil ' s number two in the austin powers series . 

i ' m sure all concerned got a big pay day out of this film , but it seems to have killed the airport saga of movies .  deep sea 3d is a stunning insight in to an underwater world only a few have had the opportunity to view first hand . 

from the opening sequence when a wave rushes towards the audience momentarily engulfing us in the ocean , the filmmakers make full use of the imax format . a jelly fish field appears to fill the whole theatre , a shark powers towards us , predators pounce from behind rocks and devour their prey . it is a beautifully captured under sea feast for the eyes . 

our ears on the other hand , are not given the same treatment . the film is narrated by hollywood stars jonny depp and kate winslet . both sound so ridiculous it positively spoils the enjoyment of the visuals . depp sounds slightly bored whilst winslet sounds as if she is reading a bedtime story to the village idiot . i was shocked that an actress of her status could have pitched her performance so wrongly . the script is fairly silly and contains very little depth . the soundtrack is filled with strange , unrealistic sound effects which i assume are meant to be funny but in fact detract attention from the material which should have been allowed to speak for itself . 

danny elfman has provided an excellent score which gives plenty of impact to the ups and downs of life under the sea , when it is allowed to play out without the silly bubble sounds or crayfish footfalls which pepper film . 

the film is a technical marvel but with it ' s childish script , annoying narration and misplaced sound effects it cannot be taken seriously .  construction workers disrupt the native american burial ground of a large , hulking skeletal monster which disintegrates it ' s victims with it ' s touch , breath , or bone sword ! the head honcho over the resort project , krantz ( jim storm ) orders his construction crew to keep their skeletal findings secret for much would halt the continuing development if the nearby katona tribe caught wind that remains were being dug up and disturbed . an aging bruce boxleitner , likable as always , stars as half-breed sheriff evans trying to keep peace between the katonas and krantz ' s crew . the peace was strained , at best , but with that skeletal monster running rampant making it ' s victims vanish without a trace , soon krantz wants answers to why members of his crew are missing . . evans begins losing citizens as well . evans is warned by katona chief storm cloud ( michael horse ) that an ancient demon , the bone eater , has been loosened and can only be stopped with a sacred war axe ( . . the axe was removed by a worker who found it ' s remains with the weapon lunged inside ) now in the back seat of his daughter kelly ' s ( clara bryant , who wears tight jeans and shirts to reveal how daddy ' s girl has grown into quite a striking lady ) boyfriend ' s truck . evans must somehow defeat the demon if the killing will stop . . and this must occur before the eclipse or it ' s power will become too strong for anyone to vanquish . 

a solid cast , floundering in an embarrassing horror outing . the cgi , isn ' t very good , although the monster could ' ve been quite threatening if done with a better budget . it rides a horse made from dust chasing after it ' s prey , for petesake ! some cameo appearances include buck rogers gil gerard as evan ' s deputy big jim , star trek ' s walter koenig as a coroner , & house ' s william katt , as a country doctor attending to the wounds of evan ' s deputy . none of these cameos last longer than one minute or so . . sad , really . adoni maropis , impresses in an underwritten role as a brooding katona , johnny black hawk , who wishes to use the bone eater to drive the white man off his tribe ' s land . jennifer lee wiggins portrays kaya , a tasty dish of a katona female whose against black hawk ' s hatred for the white man and wishes for evans to follow his indian blood regarding putting an end to the bone eating monster . this might be worth sitting through if just to see boxleitner dressed in war paint and indian garb . i felt for the actor , to be honest , as bruce tries to keep a straight-face in such a terrible movie . in yet another over-worked and tiresome clichÃ© , bruce ' s sheriff has an estranged relationship with his daughter , whose 17 , hot , and wanting to date the " bad boy " . . although this winds up being an underwritten sub-plot as is most of the plot concerning the killing skeleton and many of the poorly developed characters .  just watched this today on tcm , where the other reviewers here saw it . 

sorry that i was the only one to find davies a weak actress , with a truly awful attempt at an irish ( irish-american or otherwise ) accent . as she ' s the star , it was sort of hard for me to get past that -- especially as the other reviewers have said that this was her finest performance . 

another particularly terrible davies performance was in " marianne " ( 1929 ) , which i also watched today . in this film , given a 9 of 10 rating here , her accent switches from that of a ( correct ) french woman to an odd combination of italian and swiss . 

interestingly , in tcm ' s one-hour bio of davies -- " captured on film : the true story of marion davies " ( 2001 ) -- film historian jeanine basinger claims that " one of the things that you note about marion davies in her sound work is how good she is at doing accents . " of course this bio also includes commentary by fans ( make of that what you will ) . 

davies was a very attractive young woman , and by all accounts a terrific comedienne in real life . 

and because a part of her anatomy added immeasurably to the real-life answer to joseph cotten ' s character ' s search for the meaning behind kane ' s final word in the opening scene of the great " citizen kane , " she ' s earned her spot among the great stories if hollywood ' s history . 

but i think welles & mankiewicz got it right for the most part with the " susan alexander " facsimile of the real article . 

don ' t bother voting as to whether you agree or disagree with this post as i really couldn ' t care less .  this is a cheapy biography of a star of the black and white minstrel shows , a certain dixie boy johnson . whether this person ever really existed i don ' t know , but considering the cast lists a certain " lee lasses white " and roscoe karns playing said character as well , i assume the man did exist and that this is a white-washed ( pardon the pun ) version of his career . the plot , such as it is , follows dixie boy from career heights to depression at the death of his wife in childbirth , his abandonment of the child to friends , and his return at his daughter ' s sixteenth birthday and stage debut for reconciliation . another forgotten man , benny fields , plays dixie boy . the man has a lovely baritone voice but no acting talent whatsoever and is a boring lump on screen . gladys george valiantly tries her best to enliven the works to no avail . judy clark does the best impersonation of betty hutton i ' ve ever seen although i believe she thought she was being herself . the scoring replete with many musical numbers for its short running time of 70 minutes earned a deserved oscar nom . worth a look .  enchanted april was one of harry beaumont ' s last movies- he only directed a few more after this one . he had made the " maisie " movies in the 1930s and 1940s . in the opening credits , it says " from the novel by elizabeth " , and completely leaves off the author ' s last name . . . rather odd , but since it was von armin , they may not have wanted the german association at the time . . . sad to hear it was a flop when it was released , with those fun names like frank morgan ( the wizard ) and jessie ralph , who played w . c . fields ' disapproving mother- in- law in " bank dick " . two gals in london ( ann harding & katharine alexander ) decide to rent a castle to host two of their friends , but things don ' t go the way they planned . reginald owen plays the husband with multiple personalities . aside from a few funny moments , it does move pretty slow . ralph is the only bright spot here , as the overbearing take-charge type , and the picture is quite fuzzy and out of focus for much of the film . the views of italy are all obvious backdrops . the only saving grace here is that the turner classic version is only 66 minutes long . too bad they didn ' t give frank morgan a larger role . this was remade in 1992 by the bbc as a british film .  just watched on ubuweb this early experimental short film directed by william vance and orson welles . yes , you read that right , orson welles ! years before he gained fame for radio ' s " the war of the worlds " and his feature debut citizen kane , welles was a 19-year-old just finding his muse . besides vance and welles , another player here was one virginia nicholson , who would become orson ' s first wife . she plays a woman who keeps sitting on something that rocks back and forth courtesy of an african-american servant ( paul edgerton in blackface ) . during this time a man ( welles ) keeps passing her by ( courtesy of the scene constantly repeating ) . i won ' t reveal any more except to say how interesting the silent images were as they jump-cut constantly . that ' s not to say this was any good but it was fascinating to watch even with the guitar score ( by larry morotta ) added in the 2005 print i watched . worth a look for welles enthusiasts and anyone with a taste of the avant-garde .  this movie is way too long . i lost interest about one hour into the story . saratoga trunk tells the story of ingrid bergman , who is an the child of a prominent new orleans man and his mistress . after her mother dies in paris , bergman comes back to new orleans to scandalize her father ' s " legitimate " family and to blackmail them . she meets gary cooper , who is likewise seeking revenge against the railroad tycoons who cheated his father out of his land in texas . she draws him into her schemes , and the movie climaxes at a saratoga resort . long and boring , but worth watching if you are a bergman or cooper fan . the midget cupidon provides the only bright spot in this meandering story .  dear reader , watch out ! this movie is not really a movie , though its creators have the impertinence to call it so . if you have not been warned about its content , here it goes : the film is simply a sequence of imagines which flow continually and are trying to transmit a certain feeling , concept . they could be called , therefore , symbols . the images are accompanied by a soundtrack , it ' s purpose being to create atmosphere as well . however , the images the director has chosen can only transmit feelings to an american audience , because they are , in an overwhelming number , american icons . though the film is intended to express the idea of " civilized warfare " , it fails to do so not only because of the general chaos , but also because it is far too long and tiresome , and i strongly felt that a lot of the scenes have not to do with " war " , in whichever conception . to conclude , i was greatly disappointed by a documentary which is not a documentary , a movie which is not a movie , a " something " whose only strong point is the extraordinary use of technology in image processing .  bronson and ireland , in their last film together , make a likable pair . he is more restrained than usual and she has become a winning actress . but as a thriller the film is totally worthless . its premise is downright silly and its pace is much too rushed .  the film version of ' rising damp ' came out two years after the television series ended . like many fans i duly went along to the cinema when it opened . i came away bitterly disappointed . eric chappell could not have spent very much time writing the script ; most of it is rehashed ideas from old episodes . at the time of the film ' s release , the ' rising damp ' series was still being repeated regularly on i . t . v . so the public was being asked to pay to see something they ' d seen already . at least the ' on the buses ' movies boasted original screenplays . 

secondly , richard beckinsale had died the year before , so they eliminated the character of ' alan ' as a mark of respect , substituting art student ' john ' , played by christopher strauli of ' only when i laugh ' fame . it simply wasn ' t the same . 

as another poster has pointed out , rigsby ' s boarding house looked nothing like the one used in the series , being bigger and altogether cleaner . 

director joe mcgrath was one of the directors who worked on the original ' casino royale ' , a film steeped in surreal humour . ' rising damp ' also has its share of ' walter mitty ' style fantasy sequences , such as the ' saturday night fever ' parody . personally , i found them horribly out of place . a case of ' over-egging the pudding ' . 

on the plus side , leonard rossiter is as magnificent as ever as the seedy ' rigsby ' , as are frances de la tour as ' ruth ' and don warrington as ' philip . its just a shame the film isn ' t worthy of their talents . 

when rossiter died in 1984 , it was shown by i . t . v . as a tribute , with its final scene - showing rigsby laying prostrate at the foot of the stairs - removed in the interests of good taste .  my mother took me to this movie at the drive-in when i was around seven years old , which is thirty years ago . she had no idea a family movie would be so violent . my clearest memory was of the boy ' s father ' s face of pain as he was stabbed in the stomach and killed . this image haunted me for weeks . i had learned that i lived in a world where a person might stab my father at anytime . how could i stop them ? how could my father protect himself ? you must realise that this stabbing is not fantasy to a seven-year old . it is as real as witnessing an actual event , and has no place in a child ' s innocent mind . it is sad that we still do not understand the impact that bringing violence into the lives of our children has both on our children and our society . if only parents would protect their children from images of violence with the same vigor that they protect them from images of nudity and sex .  i was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors appearing in " dear john , " but it was very slow moving ; and i felt that both the screenplay and the direction hampered the flexibility of the principle performers . i usually do enjoy film adaptations of these novels . ironically , i did think the movie did an excellent job of depicting realistic military action . 

the cinematography was very good at segueing through love letters , focusing just enough on a key word or phrase in each letter . i felt that channing tatum became bogged down in what became a very " hang-dog " series of expressions in response to loss .  much can usually be forgiven in period pieces that ask us to recall important historical events and spice them with enough love interest to keep the story going . battle of the brave tackles the 18th century struggle for the control of quebec ( an all of canada ) between the british and the french with sidebars form the new america . it has the makings of a sweeping epic of fascination , but sadly in the hands of writer pierre billon ( whose script deserves a razzie award for worst of the season ) and the scattered , unfocused , and confusing direction by jean beaudin this film is a dud - a two and a quarter hour tedious mess of a film . 

even a cast a fine actors - pairing noÃ©mie godin-vigneau as marie-loup carignan with david la haye as franÃ§ois le gardeur , adding the lovely bianca gervais as acoona , the venerable gÃ©rard depardieu as le curÃ© thomas blondeau , and the likes of irÃ¨ne jacob , vincent perez ( ridiculous in period wigs ) , tim roth as william pitt , colm meaney as benjamin franklin , and jason isaacs as gÃ©nÃ©ral james wolfe - doesn ' t help . veteran actors such as these must have cringed at the crude lines written for their characters ! cover the whole mess in a sappy musical score by patrick doyle and the result is a long film to be avoided . sad to say such bad things about a costly project , but be warned . . . . grady harp history teacher mrs tingle seems to have it in for student leigh ann watson , who has her heart on achieving a writing school scholarship . she receives another low grade from tingle , which doesn ' t help . when one of her classmates luke steals the paper of the final history exams and pops it in her bag , mrs . tingle finds it sticking out . she threatens the three that she will go to the principal about it , but he ' s not available . so before she reports it the next morning . leigh , her friend jo lynn and scott head to her place that night and try to convince her not tell the principal . however due to tingle ' s stubbornness , that find themselves reverting to drastic measures to stop this getting out . 

wasn ' t fan of it when i first saw it , and after another viewing , i ' m still not one . writer kevin williamson was on a roll after penning the successful contemporary teen horror films ; ' scream ( 1996 ) ' , ' i know what you did last summer ( 1997 ) ' , ' scream 2 ( 1997 ) ' and ' the faculty ( 1998 ) ' . he was riding the success ( also not to forget the tv show ' dawson ' s creek ) , but this project would be the final bump . the difference there , compared with this entry was other then writing the screenplay , he was also making his debut in directing . the strange thing though , was that i found his direction to be competently done , but material he stormed up to flavourless and tired . it seemed to get caught in playing both a black comedy and straight-out thriller , without making it gel . the script is cluttered with quick-wit , on-going gags , trivial stretches and gimmicky references towards other films , but the problem is that it ' s too watered-down with so many contrived developments and sappy moral currents disrupting the flow . the fractured script had to be more strong and potent , since it ' s a small-scale production that feels like you ' re watching a stage show because of its mostly confined sets . it tries to play mind games with the characters , but these moments are there to only serve the story ' s poor progression into a puddle of stupidity and senselessness . the film ' s ending takes the cake . williamson ' s polished direction is sound , but more so in a pedestrian way and therefore it lacks suspense and the pacing even with its taut surroundings can really plod on . you eventually feel it after the halfway mark , and it shows up how minor the story is . the performances are tolerable enough , although if it weren ' t for helen mirren ' s classy , icy portrayal of manipulative prowess as mrs . tingle and a buoyant marisa coughlan , we would have been stuck watching a vapid goody-to-shoes katie holmes . barry watson is modest in his slacker part and molly ringwald has a lesser role . the soundtrack packs enough energy , but i found it terribly overwrought and shapeless in its choices . 

watchable , but mechanical all round .  quentin tarantino ' s partner in crime roger avary ( co-writer on " pulp fiction " ) ventures out on his own ( q . t . goes exec . prod . this time ) for this over-boiled french thriller . 

eric stoltz is zed , safe cracker extraordinaire who has drifted over to france from the u . s . at the request of an old friend . there he teams up with a motley crew of drugged out hippies who , with little or no planning , think they can knock off a bank vault full of gold bullion on a french national holiday . 

avary has reworked the robbery gone wrong theme that tarantino developed so well in " reservoir dogs " , only " killing zoe " is not good enough to survive on the strength of this alone , so avary has thrown in a rather beautiful distraction . julie delpy is zoe , a student come call girl who entertains zed on his arrival in paris . a stunning distraction she certainly is , but nothing more . 

i guess our director wanted to add a different angle to this basic theme , but sadly the move did not help to add the depth his shallow plot so desperately needed . there was never a story in this idea , which was nothing more than that , an idea . even the surreal journey into the seedy dives of paris is uninspiring . i figure one would have to concede that there was never much of a movie in the story of a bunch of gangsters shooting each other up over a botched jewellery heist either , that is until you add intricate characters and snappy dialogue . " reservoir dogs " had it , " killing zoe " did not . 

stoltz ' s strong interpretation of the doubtful zed and jean hughes-anglade ' s mad portrayal of the obsessive ring leader do nothing to lift proceedings . in short , avary has unsuccessfully attempted to conjure entertainment out of nothing . 

friday , september 15 , 1995 - astor theatre if you think it ' s beautiful to be obsessive about who you are in love with , then i can imagine giving it a good rating . . . but i cannot imagine that this theme of obsessiveness and having little respect for others ( such as the way paulie treats the teachers who try to help her ) is anything you would want to teach your children . yes , it ' s also bad the way victoria treated paulie , but guess what . that ' s life . isn ' t it a more important lesson to learn how to get past these disappointments and make the best of your life ? or is falling off the roof a better lesson to teach our children ? secondly , when mary ' s father didn ' t show up for the dinner , and paulie helped mary release her anger , that mary even said she wished he were dead . . . somehow i don ' t think this is a good message either that you deal with your disappointments through anger .  eddie murphy put a lot into this movie by directed wrote starred and produced this story about two nighclub owners in the 30s who try to fight mobsters and corrupt cops from taking over their club . . a great cast in murphy redd foxx , richard pryor , danny aiello , della reese , and a gorgeous jasmine guy that would make it worth seeing on its own . . but the story just doesnt hold up interest or give the great cast enough to work with . . on a scale of one to ten . . a 4 i really wanted to love this film . i have read the book to my daughters and we all loved it . the book is marvelous . this film is very far from the book . the book is splendid - this film is an awful adaptation . 

in the book , sara is honorable , kind , strong , and never does anything spiteful to get back at anyone . that ' s the point of the book ! she behaves as a " princes " regardless of circumstances . an important part of behaving like a princess is to not return unkindness . it is to behave honorably regardless of how you are being treated . 

in the book , she endures much and touches the lives of others . other people change their behaviors after they witnessed her kindness and ability to endure without sinking to spite and vengefulness . sara does what is right simply because it is right . 

outside of the bakery , she comes upon a beggar girl who is more poor and hungry than she is . she has half a dozen hot buns . she is very hungry . she gives one bun to this wild looking little girl huddled on the doorstep of the bakery . when she sees how ravenous the girl is and watches her gobble the bun , she gives her another . she continues to do this until she has given 3 or 4 i think - i don ' t remember how many . 

the baker is watching through the window . she is so moved by what she has witnessed , she takes the beggar girl in and raises her as her own daughter . other people are similarly influenced by sara . 

and in the book , her father has died . the man next door is her father ' s partner - he has been looking for her . her father did not lose his money after all - the man is thrilled to find sara ; he takes her and becky into his home and raises them as his daughters . and sara has her full inheritance , of course . 

miss minchin is not a chimney sweep . in fact , she remains in her same post at the school . but she is humiliated as sara has told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she received . and sara does speak to miss minchin in the end - miss minchin is trying to minimize her treatment of sara and sara with a calm steadfast demeanor , instructs miss minchin that she had been cruel . 

there is no comeuppance for miss minchin . she continues on in her miserable existence . it does not matter - what matters is that sara has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her dearest friend in the world , becky , is now for all intents and purposes , her sister . 

the book is about love and honorable behavior under the worst of circumstances . it is about self control and humility . it is a wonderful book . this film does nothing to capture the true story and messages of the book . my wife was so disgusted with it , she wanted to leave the theater in the middle , but we decided to stick it out . we were not rewarded . 

i cannot for the life of me think of a reason the film makes should alter this excellent book in such a bad direction . perhaps it was the influence of the ghastly screenplay from the book that shirley temple acted in . i don ' t know - but this film is so far from the book in character and values that i do not recognize it . 

don ' t waste your time - buy the book . it is unforgettable . . . even for a dad !  lame rip-off of the quatermass xperiment ( 1955 ) : the first half is deadly dull , even dreary - but the latter stages improve considerably with the scenes involving the rampaging ' monster ' . in the accompanying featurette ( a rather dry affair at a mere 9 minutes , when compared to the ones created for the other titles in criterion ' s " monsters & madmen " set ) , director day - who admits to not being a fan of the sci-fi genre - tries to justify the film ' s shortcomings by saying that he had a zero-budget to work with ( where all the outer space scenes were composed of stock footage ! ) . . . and i ' d have been inclined to be more lenient with the film had i not recently watched caltiki , the immortal monster ( 1959 ) - a similar ( and similarly threadbare ) but far more stylish venture from italy ! 

bill edwards as the cocky but unlucky astronaut - obsessed with achieving the titular feat - is positively boring at first , but he eventually manages to garner audience sympathy when his physical features are deformed and the character develops a taste for blood ! marshall thompson as his commanding officer and elder brother is o . k . as a leaner glenn ford type ; he had previously starred in fiend without a face ( 1958 ) , another ( and more successful ) richard gordon-produced sci-fi which , incidentally , is also available on dvd through criterion . italian starlet marla landi , struggling with the english language , makes for an inadequate female lead ; even her input in the featurette proves to be of little lasting value ! 

the audio commentary is yet another enjoyable tom weaver / richard gordon track where , among many things , the fact that first man into space was intended as a double-feature with corridors of blood ( 1958 ) is brought up - but it was eventually put out as a standalone release , so as to exploit the topical news value of the current space race ; it ' s also mentioned that the monster dialogue was actually dubbed by bonar colleano ( who , tragically , died in a traffic accident prior to the film ' s release ! ) . weaver even recalls a couple of anecdotes from the time when he was involved in the production of the dvd featurette shot by , of all people , ex-cult-ish film-maker norman j . warren : landi , who by then had become a lady of title , was still ready to help out in carrying the equipment necessary to film the interview down several flights of stairs ! ; edwards was supposed to have contributed to the featurette but , once in london , he proved reluctant to co-operate with weaver - eventually , the latter learned that the actor had been recently diagnosed with cancer and , in fact , he died in 2002 !  like ' singin ' in the rain ' , ' cover girl ' has a trio of two guys and a girl . in ' cover girl ' , phil silvers ( genius ) is the comic relief . he corresponds to donald o ' connor ' s funny man part in ' singin in the rain ' . in cover girl , gene kelly ' s love interest is rita hayworth and in ' rain ' , it ' s debbie reynolds . that ' s where the comparison ends . 

whereas " singin ' in the rain ' is a classic american movie musical , ' cover girl ' is mediocrity incarnate . the story isn ' t very complicated . rusty parker ( rita hayworth ) is a dancer in danny macguire ' s low-rent nightclub in brooklyn . rusty decides to enter a cover girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher , john coudair , who made an unsuccessful play for rusty ' s grandmother years ago . coudair introduces rusty to broadway producer noel wheaton who makes her into a star . danny feels slighted when rusty starts showing up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club down and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his sidekick , genius . at the last minute , with rusty at the altar with noel , she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to danny . they live happily ever after . 

gene kelly has the least developed part in the movie . all we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with rusty . coudair and wheaton act like besotted teenagers toward rusty and phil silvers delivers some thoroughly goofy but unfunny shtick . the most interesting aspect of rita hayworth ' s performance is the scene in which she gets drunk . this foreshadows what happened to her in real life . anyone who has read her biography will learn that she disliked hollywood , pined away for a normal home life which she could never attain but eventually began drinking and ended up with full-blown alzheimer ' s during the last years of her life . 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful . gene kelly has only one really excellent dance number and that ' s the scene where he dances with his ' alter ego ' . earlier , the trio has another number which is a pale precursor of ' make em laugh ' from ' singin ' in the rain ' . 

the most annoying thing about ' cover girl ' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal . a couple of decades later , raquel welch had the same problem . both actresses later in their careers would always try and find scripts that showcased their acting abilities . they wanted to be known as ' actresses ' and not ' pinup girls ' . unfortunately , ' cover girl ' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain .  dakota incident has to be one of the strangest westerns i ' ve ever seen . not good , but definitely strange . 

a driver-less stagecoach rides into the town of christian flats with all passengers killed . it ' s scheduled to go on , but very few for obvious reasons want to risk the cheyennes on the warpath out there . but linda darnell , regis toomey , john lund , whit bissell , and ward bond each have their reasons for going on . and dale robertson who killed john doucette in a gunfight after doucette and skip homeier shot and left him for dead in the desert , is so anxious to go he ' s willing to drive the team . 

of course the cheyennes attack the intrepid group of passengers if forced into a dry wash for cover . who will live and who will die is the remainder of the film . 

dakota incident came at the very end of republic pictures before herbert j . yates pulled the plug on his little studio . westerns were their specialty , but normally of the kind roy rogers made . this would not have been a rogers product . 

in fact it ' s beyond belief . the characters aren ' t ground in any kind of reality . whit bissell is taking back ore samples from his claim , but robertson discovers it ' s iron pyrites , fool ' s gold . toomey is a guitar playing cynic who goes mad from thirst . darnell is after a cheating manager of her ' s , but really doesn ' t know what to do when she finds him . lund is looking to bring in robertson who committed a crime he took the rap for , but has to bring him in alive . for that he ' d require help , but doesn ' t have any . 

but the worst is ward bond who ' s a united states senator on his own peace mission to the cheyennes . in real life bond was a most right wing individual and i ' m not sure this wasn ' t some kind of a caricature of what he would perceive as a liberal . he ' s really quite the fatuous fool , but i think that might have attracted him to the role . 

i tried to get into dakota incident , but couldn ' t . and the ending was a bizarre fantasy to say the least . 

give it three stars for the cast involved .  carmen is a prostitute that lives seducing and stealing soldiers of the spanish army ; she is , without any doubt , the best femme fatale at the moment . when a man resist her charming attentions , she decides to do everything to destroy him . at the end , he falls in her web and he will be forced to make all the things he ever hated only for being with carmen . despite paz vega is very beautiful , she doesn ' t seem a gypsy ( as carmen is ) and neither her acting nor sbaraglia ' s are good . the story results very boring , and , in most moments , it is very absurd , while intending to appear truthful . in the same way are the scenarios and the special effects , despite not being but they are not but acceptable , and too much artificial for a historic film as it is . to sum up , boring and bad , with a very absurd development , there are much betters thing to watch .  i happened to see this film on a flight from paris to boston and it reminded me of the food on the plane : generic , tasteless and obscure . the french cinema seems to have lost its footing these days and this is a good example of how a motley script can waste brilliant actors . while some may find the ' playfulness ' of the script to be in line with the dictates of euro post modernism , the whole project seems more like a post-mortem on the death of euro-cinema ' s golden years and truly fabulous talents --- one is vaguely reminded here of bunuel but without the charm or wit .  in short , this movie is a declaration of artistic bankruptcy . 

almodovar is easily the most important european film maker of the 80s and 90s . no other living director has shaped the style and contents of present-day european cinema more than him . it is therefore not easy to say that his latest effort is not just another disappointment after two lackluster films , but rather a complete and total disaster confirming that he has run out of ideas , out of humour and , worst of all , empathy for the characters he creates . 

that is not due to the complexity of the story . all almodovar films are almost impossible to summarize . this time , in fact , it ' s rather easy if you are familiar with his earlier work . " broken embraces " is a remake of " law of desire " , only this time the director is straight and the jealous jilted lover is a millionaire . 

for those of you not familiar with that film , i ' m doing a summary . if you don ' t want to know too much , please skip this paragraph . a blind man , who used to be a famous movie director , seduces a sexy buxom woman reading a paper to him after a chance street encounter ( yes , really , that ' s how it starts ) . just then he gets a visit by his agent and best friend . he mentions to her that he has learned from the paper that a certain millionaire has died , which takes the story 14 years back . he can still see and is about to direct his next film . he stars the inexperienced mistress of the said millionaire as the lead , as he is instantly smitten with her . the millionaire discovers their affair via silent videos made by his gay son , which he has lip-synched by an interpreter ( a few great scenes : cecilia roth ) . after violent quarrels , the mistress escapes with the director to a seaside resort where he learns that the millionaire , who produced the film , had it released in the worst possible edit , destroying the director ' s reputation . the couple decides to return , but has an accident in which the director turns blind and the would-be actress dies . back in the present , he learns that his agent has preserved the film ' s negatives and starts to reconstruct it . 

as in " bad education " , there are various sub plots to beef up this rather thin story , and as in " bad education " , the result is more confusing than satisfactory . for instance , the agent ' s son , who works as a dj , has an accidental drug overdose - which is completely unnecessary for the plot , and also interpreted rather badly . 

mostly , however , the actors are not to blame , but the way their characters are written . blanca portilla as the agent has so many skeletons in her closet that not even a brilliant performance can save the character from ridicule . lluis homar is an old man ' s dream of a protagonist , living in an artificial world where an english alias and a few sweet words can seduce any super model . and penelope cruz is the embodiment of this old man ' s sexual fantasy . her character is completely lifeless . it remains thoroughly incomprehensible why she would go from one old man , who at least helped her family , to a slightly less old man , who isn ' t charming enough to convince as either a romantic hero or a passion fuse . 

but all these shortcomings wouldn ' t make this film so awful . however , almodovar does the worst possible thing of a director ( or any type of storyteller ) running out of ideas : he quotes himself , something he has increasingly done , and to very little benefit . the film-within-the-film , which " broken embraces " uses as a plot-driving device , is actually " women at the verge of a nervous breakdown " ( 1988 ) , only this time it is called " chicks and suitcases " . this rather unimaginative title may give you a hint how this beloved classic is treated here : while the dialog making up the final ten minutes of " broken embraces " is a frantic , over-the-top exchange of screwball one-liners in the original film , here it is a stern , colorless , pesky business encounter . 

in conclusion , this is the d . o . a . brainchild of an exhausted creator of past marvels , pretty much as awful and disappointing as the last indiana jones feature . maybe not so many people would agree with that , because almodovar used to be such a genius . i ' d rather offer my respect to his accomplishments by humbly asking the reader to watch " all about my mother " , or " tie me up " , or " high heels " , or " matador " , all of which bear witness to almodovar ' s unique and unmatched talent . a few more film like this , and his legacy may very well be destroyed for good .  though some would prefer to comment on the value of bond movies in the connection of learning frequency , and while most of the jargon that tends to limit bond to a meager 007 following has been exploited beyond all reasonable contention , there are several redeeming plausibilities that extend the credibility of sean connery in this doubling role that had seen its counterpart adaptation in part of a previous performance by jessica tandy in driving miss daisy . while connery had been less visible in the latter , his woman-seeker qualities had maybe not cast a frown on the face of embittered spectators as it would in this latest rendition which , to most involved , approached the 007 theme with kind resentment , albeit while the general flavor had been altered . great for those who interest others while faking to be who you ' re not !  so many great actors , so little worth watching . but with a script that misses so much of what made the book special , i don ' t hold it against anyone on screen . though flawed , the book was one of grisham ' s only that i truly liked , especially how it captured the flavor of a deep south small town , a slightly different world to a coastal urbanite such as myself . i also loved the matter-of-factness , naturalness of what occurs in the book . in the movie characters are given a " nobility " of personality that seemed so stilted . the villains and foils are flat and 1 dimensional . but as with so much of joel schumacher ' s work , genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent , and every point must be delivered via sledgehammer to the midsection . so preachy , stilted , and superficial about so horrendous a tragedy , i wish someone would do a remake and get the story a little more right .  a friend of mine , who is even more into 1970s cult films than myself , recommended this one to me and in fact gave me the copy of it that i watched . however , i was not as enthusiastic about the result as he Â or , for that matter , michael elliott Â was . the film is a hybrid of house of wax ( 1953 ) and the texas chain saw massacre ( 1974 ) : indeed , i would venture to say that it served as the basis of the 2005 remake of the former much more than the ' original ' did ! so , we have a remote and derelict wax museum of incredibly lifelike dummies ( guess why that is ? ) with its apparently harmless curator ( a hammy chuck connors ) being ' invaded ' by the obligatory group of stranded teenagers ( among them tanya roberts ) . he also has a mad brother Â shades of psycho ( 1960 ) incorporated for good measure , down to the self-same twist Â who is supposed to be a mechanical genius ( showcased in a ' poltergeist ' which unaccountably accompanies the first murder ) . the film does benefit from a pino donaggio score but , being so derivative and not especially well made to boot , essentially ends up merely a redundant ( and fairly muddled ) genre effort .  i have a question for the writers and producers of " prozac nation " : what is the root cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in america ? in the moving performance of christina ricci as liz wurtzel , the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a harvard student and as a writer . but this is not a story of success , only one of self-destruction as we watch liz bring misery into the lives everyone who comes in contact with her . the film examines divorce , family dysfunction , drugs , alcohol , and prescription medication as possible reasons for liz ' s unhappiness . but none of those superficial explanations are satisfactory . 

at some point in the film , it would have been helpful to suggest that liz needs to take responsibility for her life and her problems . no light was shed on what the film alleged to be a runaway problem in " the united states of depression . " in the story , liz had a caring therapist ( anne heche ) , a caring roommate ( michele williams ) , a caring boyfriend ( jason biggs ) , and a troubled but caring parent ( jessica lange ) . in a key scene in the film , liz is lying in a hospital bed watching the break-up of the space shuttle challenger . instead of equating challenger with liz ' s life , the film should have used the image as a starting point for her healing and recovery . 

this film reminded me of a generic made-for-cable " victim " film on the lifetime network . an excellent cast was wasted , especially in the earnest performance of christina ricci . the real-life elizabeth wurtzel obviously found within herself the resources to cope with her depression and become a successful author . it is unfortunate that the film could not offer us even the slightest glimpse into her courageous spirit .  jack lemmon was one of our great actors . his performances in days of wine and roses , the apartment , some like it hot , missing ( to name the first ones that come to mind ) were all worthy of best actor nomination . his only win was for save the tiger , and that ' s a shame . he gets melancholy down to a science , but never brings it into balance with the driver in his character . he actually did a similar character much better toward the end of his career in the one-note glengarry glen ross . 

as for the movie , wonderful supporting work by jack gilford as lemmon ' s partner and thayer david as an arsonist , go for naught because the rest of the script is a muddled jumble of cliched vignettes , angst , neurotic nostalgia , and pointless moralizing . worth seeing once as a time capsule into 1970 ' s style experimental direction by avildsen .  one of the worst films of it ' s genre . 

the only bright spots were lee merriwether showing some of the sparkle she would later bring to the time tunnel and batman . 

a young patty duke also outshone the more established actors . 

 guy pearce almost looks like flynn , and this resemblance is the only one this film can claim . nowhere in flynn ' s autobiography is the klaus reicher character mention , the homosexual encounter is speculative fiction , and the movie ' s claims that flynn treated native labor badly are groundless . director frank howson hasn ' t made any memorable films , and i find it lame for him to groundlessly slander flynn to further his unremarkable career . 

 typically elaborately crafted hbo production with a first-rate cast , a rich small-town atmosphere and some nice narrative vignettes , graced by above average production values . 

but , and that ' s a huge ' but ' , the various subplots , peopled with some likable , mostly annoying caricatures , are paper-thin and go and and on in dull stretches for over three long hours . 

the often silly story veers uneasily between melodrama , without being entertaining enough , and personal drama , without being profound at all . 

a shame , because some scenes really shine . two or three , that is . 

4 out of 10 grubby paul newmans  " changi " is an australian comedy / drama set in the world war 2 japanese prisoner of war camp of that name . the story cuts between past events , and the present day , when the aged veterans plan a reunion . this is a much publicised and controversial miniseries , here in australia . the budget ran over ( $ 6 . 5 million aust . dollars ) ; historians and veterans criticised it ' s authenticity ; and critics pilloried the uneasy mix of comedy and drama ( shades of " pearl harbor " ) . series writer john doyle ( half of the successful roy & h . g . comedy team ) , has tried to defend himself with comments about " the characters are composites of actual people " ; " the troops used comedy to cope with the situation " ; " it ' s only based on actual events " ; " one of our actors was actually there " etc . i don ' t have a problem with any of these points . many superb fictional and factual dramas have come out of the japanese p . o . w . camp experience : " king rat " , " tenko " , " merry christmas mr . lawrence " , " bridge on the river kwai " , " paradise road " , " empire of the sun " , " blood oath " , and " a town like alice " . black comedy has often been used successfully in p . o . w dramas : " life is beautiful " , " the great escape " , " seven beauties " , " stalag 17 " , " the colditz story " , and even " hogan ' s heroes " . so why is " changi " a monumental failure ? - the acting in " changi " is uniformly excellent , the music and cinematography is good - it is the writing and direction that have let it down . every scene seemed to give me waves of deja vu . when anthony hayes is made to stand in the blazing sun , i thought " didn ' t i see alec guinness do this in " bridge on the river kwai " ? " . the sudden flashes into surreal song & dance brought back dennis potter ' s " singing detective " , but without the finesse . this borrowing happened so often , it smacked of lazy writing by cut and paste , rather than homage . the constant intercutting between the past and present stories left me unable to concentrate on either . flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool - here it left me distanced from characters , where intensity was called for . the " ausiness " is overdone - every conversation seemed to include " stone the bloody crows " & such , that i was saying " i get the point , i know they ' re aussies " . cultural stereotyping extended to the british and japanese too -sadistic young japanese officer ; uptight british officer ; wiser japanese commandant ; fun-loving , rascally aussies etc . i thought i was watching " hogan ' s heroes on the river kwai " . after 3 episodes i ' m tuning out .  this oddity contains bunuel-like touches , but doesn ' t sustain one ' s interest . a 10 year old roams a bizarro america in a stolen mustang , while the usual cult movie suspects ( dick miller , mary woronov , susie tyrell ) commit malicious acts in the name of comedy . like his after hours and vampire ' s kiss , the screenwriter delights in making you squirm . i remained unaffected , due to the broad acting . you know you ' re in for it when meat loaf and flea give the most appealing perfs . ( and what did this kid ' s screen test look like ? he ' s insufferable . ) recommended to the dozen or so fans of sonny boy ( ' 87 ) .  many people said this was a great movie with hoffman delivering a great performance . i went from suspended disbelief , to fidgety boredom , to almost walking out . there is no there there . 

hoffman does go all out . he is committed to the performance . but sometimes him playing an affected man looks just like affected actor chewing on the scenery . 

no characters in the movie other than capote are much more than placeholders - nell , jack , perry , shawn , the sheriff are all one-dimensional . 

yes the film shows the manipulative , preening , dishonest sides of capote . it shows them so many times i started to wonder why -- do the filmmakers think we need to have everything spelled out ? and again ? and again ? it refers often to capote ' s genius but does not show it . it shows him surrounded by fans and flatterers but never convinces us why . 

but my goal is not to deconstruct the film . i am sure others will have other interpretations . for me , this was a two-hour movie that felt like five .  i don ' t remember too much about this movie except that there was a distinctly gratuitous destruction of luminaires ( lamps ) . almost every fight scene included the unnecessary and wanton destruction of useful light fixtures , even if outfitted with cheesy , ' 70 ' s-style , cylindrical shades to keep with the time setting of the story . on one occasion , raucous lamp destruction takes place in a domestic fight scene between the brothers in both the living and dining rooms of their mother ' s house , with fixtures in both rooms being taken out . yet , the most malicious destruction occurs moments later in a bookie ' s office and includes , but is not limited to , the toppling of a fixture with a ceramic horse-head base , which is consequently disintegrated , and the severe denting of a cylindrical shade as a guy falls back into it during another fisticuffs fight . later , that lamp is toppled as well when the guy is shot , incurring further damage to the plastic-coated shade . 

while this movie encourages a particularly wasteful attitude toward lamps , one should keep in mind that lamps , regardless of their cheap construction or gauche , top-heavy appearance , are still valuable for the illumination that they provide . however , if you ever feel the need to vicariously smash a lamp , i would highly recommend this movie .  tycoon will never be listed as one of john wayne ' s better post stagecoach film . it ' s good in spots , has some fine action sequences in the cave in and also in the flood at the climax . but the plot leaves a lot to be desired . 

what we have in tycoon is two men who thoroughly dislike each other and that dislike prevents them from working as a team . multimillionaire cedric hardwicke has hired john wayne and james gleason to build a railroad . but then he refuses to give them the needed funds to do the job right . 

things get really complicated when wayne falls for hardwicke ' s daughter , laraine day . after a night when they have to spend time alone in an inca ruin , by convention in south america , wayne and day get a shotgun wedding even though nothing happened . 

what should have happened is these two should have been locked in a room for 24 hours together to work out their differences one way or another . their petty spites cause some fatalities among wayne ' s crew . 

but what tycoon is most known for is another piece of pettiness . laraine day was married to leo durocher the manager of the brooklyn dodgers when this was being filmed . he was a constant presence on the set , insanely jealous of john wayne who he thought might be having an affair with his wife . nothing to it , but he made his wife ' s life miserable . 

not one of the duke ' s better efforts .  blake edwards tried very hard to change julie andrews image in this film . he tried to make her sexy not realizing she already was . i think they were both still a bit irked that julie had not been chosen to film her broadway success of camelot and was passed over as not being sexy enough . unfortunately , they chose this vehicle to try and assuage this belief . it gets to the point where it is almost funny seeing rock hudson , who we all know now was gay , kissing julie every 2 minutes throughout this movie . it seems now that they were not only trying to make you believe that julie was a femme fatale but that rock was straight . sadly , they have absolutely no chemistry together and the unending kissing scenes start grossing one out . the other error they made with this picture was not knowing what kind of movie they were making . it is almost three separate movies . there is the drama of julie as the german spy trying to get military secrets from rock . there is an air war movie with lots of footage of wwi vintage planes swooping about and there is the stupid attempts at humor that blake edwards seems to think he has to insert in every one of his pictures whether it is appropriate or not , in this case , it was not . the only truly redeeming qualities in this film are looking at the always lovely dame julie and hearing her sing in that crystal clear bell-like soprano . of course if you love her , you may overlook the weaknesses of this film just because of her . you can always tell yourself , afterward , that it was a hell of a lot better than sitting through star !   " grande ecole " is not an artful exploration of mixed sexuality but , if you ' re in need of it , a movie for an x-rated channel . although i suspect there ' s nothing in this movie to spoil for a willing viewer , the plot is simply an excuse for male-to-female and male-to-male couplings set in the unconvincing context of a competition between a parisian school for future ceos and a major school for those seeking higher degrees in the liberal arts . there ' s likewise a frisson of cultural clash between high status and lower status french youth , plus a societal conflict involving native frenchmen and arab immigrants from north africa . all that ' s missing is a female-to-female coupling , which could easily have been arranged with no more than a slight twist in the plot . 

the acting is at a somewhat higher level than in the usual pornographic movie -- but " grande ecole " is , to be blunt about it , no more than pornography with artistic aspirations . i ' m not offended by the sex . it ' s just repetitive and , before long , boring . where ' s the hays office when you really need it ?   * * possible spoilers * * from dreamworks and director peter chan , `the love letter ' is a romantic comedy that takes place in a picturesque , new england coastal village where single mom helen ( kate capshaw ) owns a quaint , little bookstore . one day at work , helen happens across an anonymous letter ( the `love letter ' of the title ) that has somehow become lodged beneath the cushions of a reading couch . upon reading the amorous prose therein , she believes it has been written to her , purposely placed in the couch for her to find , and , for reasons of her own , thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer . inadvertently , however , helen leaves the letter out where her employee , janet ( ellen degeneres ) finds it , believes it to be for her , and , of course , thinks she knows who wrote it . circumstances then bring it into the possession of a young man named johnny ( tom everett scott ) , who thinks helen has written the letter to him . and before it all gets sorted out , you can only imagine the hilarious situations into which all of those involved have been cast ; and i do mean imagine , because the way this movie plays out , the audience gets little more from it than what it brings along itself . there are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails miserably : it simply isn ' t very romantic , and it ' s not funny ; and that is a potent combination that causes this film to misfire practically from the opening credits . once the setting and main character ( helen ) have been established , it basically goes nowhere for the next ninety minutes or so . by the time you finally find out who actually wrote the letter , and to whom , you could care less . rounding out the cast is tom selleck , blythe danner , julianne nicholson , gloria stuart and geraldine mcewan . it ' s a shame to see such talent wasted on such claptrap as this , and looking bad in the balance . kate capshaw , who usually brightens up the screen just by showing up , looks tired here , while selleck appears to have just come in off a three day bender that ' s lasted a week . ellen degeneres actually comes away looking the best of the bunch . it is said that the journey is often a more heady experience than the destination . in the case of `the love letter , ' however , it would have been best for all concerned if everybody had just stayed home in the first place . i rate this one 1 / 10 .  i ' m not sure this review contains spoilers , but i ' m playing it safe by indicating there might be . regardless , it ' s unlikely anyone will watch this film who isn ' t familiar with the book . 

there ' s an old wisecrack about laboring mightily and bringing forth a mouse . " comanche moon " is such a mouse . 

the novel focuses more on the indians than the americans . in adapting it for tv , mcmurtry and osanna rightly reasoned that the audience would be more interested in the whites than the reds . unfortunately , there ' s little in the novel that we don ' t already know about gus , woodrow , and their friends . so the movie gives us mostly a portentous prehash of what will occur in " lonesome dove " . the indians -- who have their own story to tell -- are largely relegated to the background -- so much so that someone who hasn ' t read the novel will rightly wonder why it ' s titled " comanche moon " . 

the novel has no overall story line , or much of a " point " . this could have been fixed in the movie , by more strongly drawing the contrast between the indians losing their lands and way of life to the encroaching americans , who bring " civilzation " . this opportunity was missed . 

unlike " lonesome dove " , " comanche moon " has few extended scenes that develop character or relationships -- at least among the americans . the extended scenes with the indians have been largely removed or shortened . and for a ( net ) four-hour film , it is remarkably episodic and choppy . one gets the feeling the script was originally longer , and cut to reduce the production costs . 

the screenplay comprises mostly clichÃ©d dialog , aphorisms , and platitudes . coming from the author of " the last picture show " , it ' s a startlingly bad script . mcmurtry and osanna had the opportunity to fix problems with the story and characterizations , but did not . 

some of the best dialog from the novel is missing or altered , for no obvious reason . for example , clara ( cassie ) shows her intense hatred of woodrow ( jack ) by condemning gus ( ennis ) for always running off to be with his " pard " . that tart little revelation of clara ' s sexual jealously is gone . then there ' s the scene where the ur-dense woodrow warns maggie not to let jake spoon " compromise " her . the exchange in the novel is shorter and harsher ; the film tones it down , and doesn ' t portray woodrow as quite the socially stupid , emotionally frozen stone he is . ( when i read that scene in the novel , i wanted to punch woodrow in the stomach -- or worse . ) there are other changes , some of them understandable . inish scull ' s eyelids are not cut off ; to do so would like have required expensive cgi . but buffalo hump has no hump ! ( perhaps it was felt unreasonable to ask wes studi to schlep around such a huge prosthesis . ) and buffalo hump ' s character is " kindler and gentler " . he is nowhere nearly as grotesquely violent as he was in the novels . 

the only good thing about this near-turkey is steve zahn ' s remarkable performance -- not so much as gus mccrae , but as robert duvall playing gus mccrae . it is uncanny . he perfectly duplicates duvall ' s mannerisms and manner of speech , without ever appearing " deliberate " or self-conscious . as was duvall , he is wholly " within " the character . and he actually shows us gus becoming " more gus " in the third part . 

the best thing about " comanche moon " is that it won ' t spoil our affection for " lonesome dove " , not just a great western , but a great american film . 

ps : for those who think rachel griffiths was over the top -- that ' s the way she was in the book .   * * * spoilers * * * * * * spoilers * * * here on earth / ( 2000 ) 1 / 2 * ( out of four ) 

mark piznarski ' s " here on earth " holds the record for a movie containing the most recycled material in 96 minutes . literally every contrivance , clichÃ© , and familiar plot element are somewhere in here ; there is simply nothing unique , original , or fresh about it . god , what an agonizing motion picture to sit through ; i wish i saw the film during its theatrical release last year so it could have earned on my year ' s worst list . this is the kind of movie where the story makes itself instantly obvious , and goes downhill from the opening credits , and worst of all , takes itself seriously . " here on earth " is clearly one of the most horrible , painful movies to come down the pike in some time . 

 " here on earth " is a teen heartthrob film , so it must contain some of hollywood ' s most prized young men who are attractive and inexperienced enough to accept a role in a movie as bad as this . chris klein and josh hartnett fit that vary description , and take the lead roles by storm . klein plays kelley , an arrogant and insolent student with a wealthy father ( clichÃ© number one ) . he is to graduate as the valedictorian and attend ivy league college following in the footsteps of his father ( stuart wilson ) . this sets up the " i don ' t want your life , " clichÃ© in which the father tries to control his son ' s life , while the son resists rebelliously . throw in kelley ' s deceased mother who committed suicide a while back . when his father brings home another woman , he brutally questions his intentions ( the " no one can replace mom " clichÃ© counts as number two ) . 

josh hartnett plays jasper , a character on the opposite side of society to kelley . his family owns a local diner . enter his long-time love interest , samantha cavanaugh ( leelee sobieski ) a waitress at the diner who covers for her sister ( who has no purpose whatsoever rather than controlling the following scene ) when jasper and kelley act like childish morons by racing their cars and ( oh no ) crashing into the diner , causing it to erupt into flames . ( conflicts between the rich and poor will count as clichÃ© number three . ) 

the bungled car chase sets both kelley and jasper up for a contrived and plausible conflict . they get in trouble with the law , but because this movie feels the need to exist , the local judge orders them an alternative to serving time : they must work together to help rebuild the diner . 

the two boys work hard during the summer growing strong and getting a nice tan . samantha ' s eye catches kelley , and romantic sparks fly . jasper is jealous , but wants what is best for his true love ( clichÃ© number four ) . her parents ( annette o ' toole and bruce greenwood ) disapprove of her little romantic triangle ( clichÃ© number five ) , but she continues two timing jasper without a second thought . her father also happens to be the local sheriff , how surprising ( lets count that melodramatic nugget clichÃ© number six ) . 

the contrived romantic feelings between kelley and samantha count as clichÃ© number seven . but samantha ' s relationship with jasper is never defined , so how can there any romantic tension ? if the film is going to induce involvement in samantha ' s choice between the two young men , then we need to see both characters from both sides . the movie depicts jasper as a distraction to her " rightful love , " kelley . it ' s clear jasper truly loves her , but it is also clear she does not love him back . this absolutely slaughters the romantic tension early in the story . 

leelee sobieski does no harm here ; however , her charm and kind performance do not fit a two-timing character like samantha . john hartnett is also right for the role of jasper , but the movie gives him nothing to do except bicker with kelley . chris klein gets to make a hunk name for himself here ; he spends much of the movie shirtless , sweaty and overworked . unfortunately he does not show off his acting ability , maybe because he has very little . the supporting cast is much more talented . bruce greenwood supplies the best performance in the film , but does not have near enough screen time to save anything but a few brief moments . i also enjoyed the performance by stuart wilson , who perfectly fits the role of a rich , controlling father of high social status . 

then we lean about samantha ' s knee problem exactly one hour and ten minutes into the movie ( another spoiler ahead ) . what is this , she has a serious incurable illness ( yet another contrivance into the picture , approximately number eight ) . her terminal disease brings the two competing young men together as friends , well , at least i think that is what the movie intended to show , that the loss of one loved by two nemeses can bring both together ( clichÃ© number nine ) . 

klein rehearses his valedictorian speech to demonstrate his character is more than a shallow stereotype , but we have seen this so many times before i would prefer a rich character rather than a deeply sentimental who hides actual feelings ( clichÃ© number , um , was it ten ) ? . the conflicts between kelley and jasper are desperate and inane ; a " your mom " comment triggers a fist fight while they rebuild the establishment . there is a retread from " armageddon , " as samantha and kelley sprawl out in an open field , horny as hell , as he slowly moves his fingers around her body , naming areas after us cities ( why not call that number eleven ) . the movie uses alcohol as a means to increase the romantic tension : an intoxicated kelley makes a fool of himself after getting in a fight with samantha ' s date , jasper , but the following day he recites desires only to dance ( clichÃ© number , oh no , i am losing count ) .  ruggero deodato is often credited for inventing the cannibal subgenre with jungle holocaust in 1975 . but director umberto lenzi , usually acknowledged as a deodato rip-off , directed the man from deep river 3 years earlier in 1972 . is it a worthy start for the genre ? well . . . . not really . . . . . 

a photographer accidentally kills a man in self-defense and while retreating into the jungles of an asian country , is captured by a native tribe who hold him captive , force him into slave labor , and eventually accept him when he marries the chief ' s daughter . throughout the whole film , i never felt this was a horror film . it was more reminiscent of a drama , like a man called horse , which i liked better . ivan rassimov is pretty good as the photographer , but it is me me lai as the chief ' s daughter who is memorable and great . i have always been a me me lai fan ever since her breathtaking performance in jungle holocaust and she is never given credit for her acting chops because she hardly speaks in her films . she is still very talented and charming . lots of real animal mutilation is the one thing about deep river that could make it a horror film , but even that doesn ' t execute well . 

the man from deep river is good to see for those who want to see what started the cannibal subgenre , but as an entry in the genre , is easily eclipsed by deodato ' s entries and even lenzi ' s own later entries . recommended only for completists and me me lai fans .  i think my summary says it all . this mtv-ish answer to the classic candid camera tv show features a gen x ( or is that gen y ) type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses , and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations . example : kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his " wedding . " kennedy is the bride , done up in a full bridal gown and long wig . the " joke " is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his " bits and pieces . " problem is , this schtick goes on way too long , obviously to fill out time . and kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun . candid camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took kennedy to get through this one , running around , constantly asking " do i look fat ? " i recognize the show was not made for me . it was made for 12-year-old pinheads who think jackass is the height of comedy today . so let them laugh . thank god the show was short-lived .  1993 was a time of change in the wwe but for this wrestlemania they decided to wind back the clock as hulk hogan returned , along with his good friend brutus beefcake , who had been out of wrestling since a paragliding accident in 1990 . 

this was not a great event . only two matches had any real build and the whole thing came off as being rushed . the in ring action wasn ' t great and the twist at the end , which i ' ll discuss later , really wasn ' t the earth shattering moment the wwe hoped it would be . 

this forgettable night started off with shawn micheals defending his intercontinental championship against the undefeated tatanka . tatanka had beaten michaels a couple of times leading into the fight . michaels had a new manager , luna vachon while tatanka was accompanied by michaels ' former manager and future wwe hall of famer sherri martel . tatanka won by dq . michaels kept his title and went straight back into his feud with marty janetty , which had been put on hold just for wrestlemania . why , i have no idea . 

next up saw the steiner brothers ( scott and rick ) defeat the headshrinkers ( samu and fatu ) with scott scoring the pin after hitting samu with the frankensteiner . good match . 

doink the clown needed help from another clown to win his match against crush . a second doink distracting crush when he was in complete control and allowing doink to get the pin and the victory . doink was an entertaining gimmick character , who got old rather quickly . 

razor ramon easily defeated the returning bob backlund in the next match . 

this brings us to the first in our double main event . as the mega maniacs team of hulk hogan and brutus beefcake , with the newly turned good guy jimmy hart in their corner , took on hart ' s former buddies money inc ( ted dibiase and irwin r shyster ) . this was a fairly sketchy finish . beefcake , as mentioned , had been in a paragliding accident requiring full facial surgery and had wrestled the match with a face mask on . shyster ripped the mask off him and beat beefcake to a pulp . the ref went down , hogan grabbed the face mask and knocked out dibiase and shyster and then hart , who was wearing a referee shirt , counted the three . another ref came down and reversed the decision , declaring money inc winners by dq . 

next up lex luger or the narcissist as he was also known at the time defeated mr perfect . this match came about because luger was being managed by perfect ' s old manager bobby heenan . perfect had is feet on the ropes when he was pinned , but the ref missed it . 

the undertaker picked up a lacklustre dq victory in a pretty poor match against the giant gonzales . the undertaker had earned the ire of gonzales ' manager harvey wippleman in 1992 and taker had defeated his big monster kamala at survivor series . wippleman vowed revenge and took it at the royal rumble as gonzales attacked taker , costing him the match . gonzales dominated undertaker in this match , but was dq ' d for choking taker out with chloroform . weird finish to a bad match . 

this bought us to our main event as wwe champion bret hart , seriously challenged as champion for the first time , put his title on the line against mr fuji ' s unstoppable monster yokozuna . yokozuna controlled the early going , but hart resisted and then took control . he had yokozuna in the sharpshooter , surely he would give in and hart would be established as an heroic hero after taking out the big monster . but fuji had other ideas , throwing salt in hart ' s face , rendering the canadian helpless as yokozuna got the pin . 

what a downer ending . but wait here comes hulk hogan . he ' s checking hart to make sure he ' s ok . suddenly fuji challenges hogan to a wwe title right then and there . hogan accepts . fuji throws salt towards hogan , but hits yokozuna instead . hogan hits the leg drop and wins the match and the title . what did i just watch ? and so , what most fans thought was going to be the night we either saw hart establish himself as a giant killer , or yokozuna establish himself as an unstoppable monster , we instead saw hulk hogan pick up a meaningless title win . a title that he would not defend for three months . as a matter of fact this was the only match hogan wrestled for the wwe before the king of the ring ppv in june 1993 .  it ' s hard to write 10 lines of copy about this so-so film noir . there just isn ' t a lot to say about it . it is not memorable enough to add to your collection , and i have a considerable amount of noirs . 

paul henreid plays a tough guy in here . he ' s not one i would think of to play this kind of role , but he ' s fine with it . he ' s a fine actor , anyway . 

everything , including the cinematography , is okay-but-not memorable . one thing that stood out : the abrupt ending . that was a surprise . it was also a surprise to see this under the heading " hollow triumph . " i ' ve never seen the film called that . it ' s always been called " scar . " 

if you read about a " tense film noir , " etc . , don ' t believe it . " tense " is not an accurate adjective for this film .  james stewart plays johnny mason , lawyer . carole lombard is jane mason , wife . lucile watson the mother-in-law harriet mason . johnny sees jane and quickly marries her . mother is disappointed . mother lives with them . many troubles are ahead . jane can ' t cook . can ' t set the table . can ' t do many things according to mother . the interaction between daughter-in-law and mother are the highlights of this film . stewart and lombard are married but just don ' t have any real magic on screen . stewart is stewart . he is good as a timid husband and son but this doesn ' t carry the film . can baby mason build bridges between jane and harriet ? a believable film for those that are married .  natalie wood portrays courtney patterson , a polio disabled songwriter who attempts to avoid being victimized as a result of involvement in her first love affair , with her partner being attorney marcus simon , played tepidly by wood ' s real-life husband , robert wagner . the film is cut heavily , but the majority of the remaining scenes shows a very weak hand from the director who permits wagner to consistently somnambulate , laying waste to a solid and nuanced performance from wood , who also proffers a fine soprano . the script is somewhat trite but the persistent nature of wagner ' s dramatic shortcoming is unfortunately in place throughout , as he is given a free hand to impose his desultory stare at wood , which must be discouraging to an actress . the progression of their relationship is erratically presented and this , coupled with choppy editing , leads the viewer to be less than assured as to what is transpiring , motivation being almost completely ignored in the writing . although largely undistinguished , the cinematography shines during one brief scene when wood is placed in a patio and , following the sound of a closing door , remains at the center while the camera ' s eye steadily pulls away demonstrating her helplessness and frailty . more controlled direction would have allowed the performers , even the limp wagner , to scale their acting along the lines of an engaging relationship ; as it was released , there is , for the most part , an immense lack of commitment .  water shows the plight of indian widows in the late 1930s , says in the end that the problem still exists largely by giving statistics in the end , refers to gandhi several times in the movie before finally having a scene depicting him and does nothing extra ordinarily innovative or new in the movie . yes , the cinematography is pretty impressive but that cannot be the soul of any movie for me . 

india has had several problems like many other nations but it has got rid of many of these problems at large . what if a movie is made on racism in america in a particular year which ends with ' x number of americans still experience racism today ' . 

a ) how would it be relevant , and , b ) how would it be some thing so extra ordinary being depicted in cinema . 

a view i read from a deepa mehta interview was that this movie is being interpreted as a voice for the marginalised every where . from reviews i read every where , the common thing i am hearing is how the director did a great job and was brave in bringing a problem to the world . the movie is more about a specific problem a society faced ( and has got rid of through reforms at large ) . 

i do not see any thing earth shattering about the movie . moreover , the movie lacked soul and shifted between the plots of chuiyya and kalyani . sarala , the young sri lankan actress , portrayed the role of chuiyya superbly and that was the only thing which impressed me about the movie , sadly .  how anyone can praise this crude film version after seeing the marvelous waterloo bridge with vivien leigh and robert taylor , is beyond comprehension . 

mae clarke ' s myra is a far cry from the role as played by vivien leigh in the remake . she plays a common american girl with a brooklyn accent and the " yeah " responses are a bit jarring when one is expecting a less coarse character . douglass montgomery ( billed in final credits as kent douglass ) is wildly improbable as a soldier smitten with her no matter how many times she lets him down . bette davis has a nothing role in a bit part . 

their melodramatic confrontations during the last twenty minutes of the film are beyond belief ( extravagant bits of overacting ) --even given the fact that this is a cruder version of the story when sound was only a few years old and silent acting was still the rage . 

just awful . and it ends abruptly with clarke losing her life during a bombing on the bridge . the end . 

it has none of the beautifully shaded performances in the mgm remake of 1940 , including a sterling supporting cast . instead , this one is mounted with low-budget production values ( and i mean a shoe-string budget ) with no subtlety at all . and there ' s no pre-code braveness in the scene where myra tells the aristocratic lady why she must not marry her son , roy . she simply says , " i picked him up on waterloo bridge . " explanation over . nothing bold there . 

summing up : for once , the original is not the best version by any means . vivien leigh and robert taylor have never been surpassed as myra and roy in the tender , exquisitely acted 1940 film classic .  i had never even heard of one dark night until someone mentioned it on a horror message board here recently , and reading into it , i gained interest due to meg tilly ' s involvement and recognizing that it was an early gig for friday the 13th vi : jason lives director tom mcloughlin . unfortunately , sad to say , it ' s nothing special . the premise has a familiarity to it : a college girl must survive the night in an old mausoleum until morning in order to join a sorority . that girl is a young meg tilly , as julie , who wishes to prove to her loving , caring boyfriend , steve ( david mason daniels ) that she can make his cruel , conniving ex-girlfriend , carol ' s ( robin evans ) sorority regardless of the tactics she pulls in order to see her fail . along with carol ' s gang is kitty ( leslie speights ) , always with a toothbrush in her mouth , and leslie ( elizabeth daily ) who doesn ' t really wish to cause julie such trouble . while leslie insists on leaving julie alone as she remains in the mausoleum , carol and kitty plan to torment the poor girl . meanwhile steve searches for her while julie , carol and kitty encounter an evil they couldn ' t possibly imagine . . the corpse of a recently diseased " psychic vampire " , whose telekinesis was of a dangerously powerful degree , will seek to drain them of their very lifeforce . the only one who can help these girls is the dead man ' s daughter , olivia ( melissa newman ) who is equipped with the same psychic power he has . 

i think what many will find exciting is the unusual evil that threatens the girls in the mausoleum , it ' s certainly different than what you normally see in the slashers that were out at this time . like adam west ' s character ( . . he was the cynical husband of olivia who found the idea of her father ' s power ridiculous ) , i had a really hard time adjusting to the tacky plot , and i personally never found anything within the film to get excited about . the mausoleum to me never really was that spooky ( . . it doesn ' t really achieve the same kind of eerie quality phantasm captured ) and the corpses which are used to attack the girls are laughably unconvincing ( . . there is one great scene where a corpse ' s face melts away ) . i have a soft spot for low budget films from this period of time , but i just never really could find a reason to get involved when you have this unsatisfying undead corpse shooting electric bolts from it ' s eyes causing other bodies to break free from their crypts to obey their master . it ' s just too silly to take seriously . carol is your typical blond bitch wishing to punish a nice girl who is dating a former flame . steve is your typical , squeaky clean all-american boyfriend , handsome and tender , who becomes the hero seeking to save his girl from whatever sinister forces are at play . to make up for the small budget director mcloughlin tries every trick in the book to thrill the audience , using a series of ooga-booga effects such as corpses which pursue young girls , chairs which shake and tremble , doors that slam shut , and objects levitating by themselves . the film obviously has it ' s fans , and i am glad i had a chance to see it , but i was a bit disappointed that one dark night wasn ' t the horror sleeper i hoped for . adam west has a very small role as the concerned husband hoping his wife will snap out of her depressed state regarding a father who had nothing to do with her . melissa newman is the troubled olivia , recognizing that she must stop her father once and for all or else he ' d continue to prey on the living . donald hotton is dockstader , an associate of olivia ' s father ' s who informs her of what he was . i wasn ' t particularly blown away by tilly ' s performance here ( . . she was basically scared most of the time ) , but she ' d get a chance to prove herself to a greater degree from this point onward . this will undoubtedly be of some value to those who watched it back at that time , for nostalgia purposes it might seduce fans of movies from this era .  supposedly , director william shatner had in mind a much ' darker ' film when it came to ' star trek v : the final frontier ' but the suits at paramount , looking at the huge box-office receipts taken in by its humor-filled predecessor , insisted the new film have plenty of laughs too . so what we get is arguably the weakest and goofiest of the six star trek movies with the original cast . there are bad ideas aplenty , along with a few good ones , and if you ' re in a charitable mood , you could look at ' the final frontier ' the same way you would a so-so episode of the tv series . on the plus side , laurence luckenbill is a fine actor and gives one of the best ' guest star ' performances in any star trek , big or small screen , ranking right up there with william windom ' s commodore decker . his portrayal of sybok , spock ' s half-brother , consistently lifts the film when it threatens to sink , which happens all too frequently . charles cooper is good too as the fat old klingon general korrd ; too bad his role isn ' t as large as he is . if the story about shatner ' s intentions is true , then i owe him an apology , because i was prepared to lay the blame for the incessant silliness and not-very-convincing action scenes squarely at his directorial feet . the reason is i ' ve always felt that , of all the trek regulars , shatner was the least ' tuned-in ' to everything that makes star trek work and what makes it special to its fans . having read his trek memoirs , it ' s very apparent to me that he considered the show another action-adventure series that just happened to have a science-fiction setting . he preferred the vision of gene coon over that of gene roddenberry ; coon was known for his work on the popular western series , ' the wild wild west . ' shatner also mentioned that a favorite star trek episode of his was ' a piece of the action , ' a silly second-season episode co-written by coon . so , finally given an opportunity to direct a star trek feature film , would not shatner follow his instincts and produce an action-filled flick with lots of tongue-in-cheek humor ? well somebody did , because that ' s what ' the final frontier ' ended up being . shatner himself definitely returns to form as the great ham and , as leonard maltin points out , the film suffers from a bad case of ' the cutes . ' in the opening scene at yosemite national park , it ' s hard to say which is worse , the super-cheesy special effects or the godawful dialogue . running gags about equipment malfunctioning on the enterprise have run all the way from ' wrath of khan ' and by this , the fifth trek movie , have run themselves into the ground . so has the idea of a ' skeleton crew ' . one new development is an apparent romantic relationship between scotty and uhura and suffice it to say one does not exactly sense flames of passion burning between the two . it ' s a pointless subplot and adds nothing . the climactic scene where ' god ' is encountered doesn ' t add much either ; whether or not this was a good idea in the first place is debatable , but the scene itself doesn ' t make much sense . ( the ' god ' creature ' s abilities seem to vary according to what is needed at the moment . ) roughly half of this is a tired retread of the climax from ' the search for spock . ' leonard nimoy manages to salvage spock ' s integrity , even while spouting such un-spock-like lines as " get a grip on yourself , doctor . " and deforest kelley , as usual , outperforms both shatner and nimoy ; he really came on as an actor in the final trek films . so this trek outing isn ' t terrible , it just isn ' t very good . there was to be one more original cast trek movie before the baton was passed to the ' next generation , ' and it was far better suited to the task than ' star trek v : the final frontier . '  virtual sexuality proves that britain can produce romantic comedies as vapid as those from america . the only differences are an ending that ties up the loose bits differently than an american film would and a cameo by ram john holder , which is always welcome . that ' s enough to make this a watcher on a cold winter ' s night .  the story of the bride fair is an amusing and engaging one , and it is to the filmmaker ' s credit that he sets out to portray rural minnesotans with the same respect ordinarily reserved for coast-dwellers . it is weird , though , to find an independent movie , the brainchild of a single person , that is as unambitious and clichÃ©-ridden as a committee-brewed hollywood potboiler . 

the portrait of rural people is intended to be affectionate , i think , but these characters don ' t ring true to me--i have had quite a few meals in small-town diners , but never overheard a debate on the merits of different nineteenth-century english novelists . one might suggest that writer / director semans has no more experience with rural culture than the coen brothers , and considerably less satiric verve .  i truly was disappointed by this film which i had high hopes for . it seems to have been rushed out to take advantage of the success of screwball comedies at the time ( including mgm ' s own " libeled lady " , which featured two of the same stars ) and the success of william powell and myrna loy . three years into their pairing , they were still attractive to watch and filled with fire in their scenes together , but a weak screenplay and rushed premise destroys any chance of it being a great followup to the previous year ' s " libeled lady " and the two " thin man " movies they had done prior to this . " double wedding " tells the story of a clothing store manufacturer , myrna loy , who is intent on dominating the life of her sister ( florence rice ) , future brother-in-law ( john beal ) , and her own servants ( which include sidney toler and mary gordon ) . when the independent spirited william powell comes into her life , having distracted rice and beal from loy ' s constant control , loy meets her match . sounds good so far , right ? yeah , an interesting premise falls short , sad to say , because loy ' s character is so one dimensional it is hard to even like her let alone see powell fall in love with her , which we know will soon happen . it ' s another attempt to put a career minded woman in her place by changing her views on her what kind of life she has been leading , something hollywood did often during its golden age . when loy says she doesn ' t have time to both run her business and have a man in her life , its a groaner . 

fortunately , other than powell , there is free-spirited jessie ralph on board . a salty wealthy older woman who helped loy start her business , she has an acquaintance with powell and can see immediately through loy ' s cool claims that she loathes him . rice and beal are a boring couple , and the whole premise of powell getting between them is senseless . then , an ex-wife of powell ' s shows up , which really isn ' t necessary at that late point in the story , and the final wedding scene ( where a crowd of people try to get into powell ' s tiny trailer ) is a weak attempt to bring some farce . ( it is funny though , that powell keeps getting hit by items meant by loy to hit edgar kennedy with ; those chuckles are most welcome , since there are so few others . ) powell and loy would do better in two later screwball comedies , " i love you again " and " love crazy " , which are sophisticated , witty , and fun . this film attempts to be all three , but ends up a sophisticated bore .  as a canadian history major , my first thing to say : historical facts are not accurate ! how can a producer do that ? the deportation of the acadian wasn ' t in 1759 when we see franklin in london , but in 1755 ! how can he pass that in the movie ? the scenes in londo were useless too . then for the story for anyone that read " les anciens canadians " , you have the story line right there . it ' s the story of la coriveau , that " witch " . add a love story too and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter ending . sure , it brought tears to my eyes . but that ' s it . then there ' s the fact it ' s apparently set up in quÃ©bec city , but it ' s mostly shot at the forteresse de louisbourg . sure it ' s a historical site and it ' s accurate to the time , but it was obvious that the scenes were not all set in quÃ©bec city . overall , if you ' re looking for a documentary of new france , go get candad : a people ' s history , a real documentary on the history of canda and new france . if you want a love story that will bring you tears , a story set up in a wonderful forest , watch new france .  thursday june 9 , 9 : 15pm egyptian theater saturday june 11 , 2 : 00pm uptown theater

being loved and belonging is essential for most children . those born to vietnamese mothers and gi fathers often found neither . the beautiful country is the story of one such child , binh , rejected by his rural village then struggling to find his american father . the film begins with green and wild country but descends into grimy sweaty ugliness and boredom . the considerable talents of tim roth and temuera morrison are wasted in pointless and ill conceived roles aboard the rusting freighter carrying binh and is dying brother across the ocean with what appear to be stock shots of stormy seas . new york city offers slave labor and clichÃ© characters . while very uneven from it ' s start the great curiosity of this film is the final segment . nick nolte is given top billing among the cast . i jokingly suggested he would probably be in the final scene only and was not far from the truth . as the journey brings binh to texas and his father the film takes on a serene and austere simplicity . a tenuous cohabitation knits these two men together into a family of father and son . the ninety odd minutes of garbage we have just watched is rewarded by a profound and subtle performance from nolte as they slowly interact . the credits rolled and i was surprised to see the names of badlands executive producer edward pressman and west texas native terrence malick .  this is species already hatching into a beautiful model ( mathilda may ) . a smashing baby with an urge to kiss and kill ! 

the movie begins with a strong launch , and infected by a bore-virus throughout the middle to end . 

the weakest spot is the presentation of the basic plot / story . as you should have compared it , natasha henstridge ' s species got the same plot , but adds up much interesting side plot and not mentioning good actions and strong clymatic ending . 

this explain why patrick stewart joins the fleet of enterprise in star trek next generation ; he wanted to find more models in glass cage , floating inside halley-comet . 

a must see for a science fiction fans .  well , well . . . even if you ' re a fervent admirer of lang ' s silent films , this early one - the first part of a two-part unfinished four-part serial ( ! ) - will leave you in doubt about fritz ' s narrative skills . ( his directorial skills aren ' t that evident either , but here and there one senses his talent for building up atmosphere . ) 

the pic ' s just pure juvenile nonsense , which wouldn ' t be half as bad , were it not for the long ponderous stretches in between the childish action scenes . 

but the whole affair almost gets by on its amiable innocence . 

4 out of 10 inca treasures rebecca de mornay can be a fascinating beautiful actress but as for the parts she ' s given to play , if you cannot say something nice . . . 

de mornay portrays a woman who had terrible traumas as a child with a father she can hardly stand now that she ' s a grown up and has become a -of course brilliant- shrink . she has an affair with banderas , whom we suspect of being ( ouch ! how original ! ) a serial killer . sometimes she recalls banderas ' s mother-in-law tippi hedren ' s character in " marnie " . but i wouldn ' t count on it : hitchcock died twenty-four years ago , and a lot of regents desperately try to replace him . here the director pulls out all the stops to make a thriller with an unexpected end , but that ending is so far-fetched it is absolutely impossible to buy it . the movie includes the obligatory " conversations with a serial killer " in the " silence of the lamb " tradition , murders ( human beings and cats ) , split personality , and open ending in case the crowds should call for more . apparently they did not , and they were right .  the basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois . fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this , using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists , invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience . 

it ' s really rather messy though . fellowes doesn ' t seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat-edged . rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves . 

the dialogue is inconsistent , stagey here , vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clichÃ©-landmine . though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can ' t create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces . there ' s also a very prosaic , dare i say it british feel to the filming . i didn ' t want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation , i wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story . 

finally it is , in fact , the story which lets the rest down . just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes , woven as a vehicle for character examination . wilkinson and watson support this meta-essay with good performances and john warnaby ' s ebullient colleague simon to wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowing . 

i ' m disappointed ; not that it ' s bad , but that it could have been much better . 3 / 10 such a highly-anticipated remake of a cherished musical classic and such a bitter pill it was to have to take . very , very hard to swallow . . . all of it . it didn ' t have an ounce of believability anywhere . and when you don ' t have a rose , you don ' t have a show . 

bette midler seemed born to play this part . yet , all she was able to produce was a cute , funny , glitzy , trademark bette midler . . . weighed down with all the familiar midlerisms . roz russell has nothing to worry about . she can rest in her grave knowing she is still the definitive mama rose ( of film , anyway ) . 

i thought midler was really going to put it across this time . . . to throw herself into what is one of the greatest musical roles of all time . . . like she did in " the rose . " but , no , she played it safe . she played herself . she made rose a total dinner-theatre cartoon . even her songs were uninspired . it was maddening to watch , knowing midler has the talent to rise above her money-making schtick . she showed promise only once in this " gypsy " and that was with " rose ' s turn . " but , by then it was too little , too late . 

a sincere cynthia gibb as the titular heroine gave the film its only true spark and when the role of gypsy outshines that of rose , you know there ' s trouble in river city . 

a huge , huge letdown .  well to do american divorcÃ©e with more money than brains buys a rundown villa in tuscany . ( much more money ; whilst having to dicker over the price , she subsequently manages to cook sumptuous buffets for her workmen and wander around italy indefinitely with no job or apparent means of support . ) interminable boredom and the inevitable italian lover ensue ; this is a chick flick in the most pejorative sense of the term . lane acts like an unskilled clueless teenage ingÃ©nue throughout - which dynamically clashes with her seriously fading looks - along the way smashing into a variety of ( mostly italian ) cardboard stereotypes , dykes , divas , senile contessas and gigolos among them . bloated with unnecessary scenes , the most ridiculous being a clumsily inserted and pointless recreation of the fountain scene in ' la dolce vita ' . ( a similar conceit was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in ' only you ' , norman jewison ' s vastly superior ode to italy and romance ) . ' tuscan sun ' may be the most vacant piece of cinema of the last decade , despite its admittedly well-lensed panoramas of italy . bonus negative point for the extraneous lover parachuted in at the last minute to provide requisite hollywood ending for its targeted audience of oprah-brainwashed housewives . avoid at all costs , unless , of course , you view oprah and dr . phil as pinnacles of intelligent discourse .   " my blue heaven " is boring . the plot is insipid ; the characterizations and dialogue stink ; the musical numbers , while occasionally staged in interesting ways , are not only too often absurd , but also lyrically trite , painfully bright , and emotionally hollow to the core . the leads , betty grable and dan dailey , are attractive professionals ; however , in spite of their every talented effort to uplift the drear and uncompelling material , they fail . david wayne and jane wyatt , for all their demonstrated talent in other projects , are more or less cyphers here . 

there ' s really only one reason to watch " my blue heaven " . one reason . . . one star : mitzi gaynor , in her film debut . her total screen time is probably less than ten minutes , but so what ? her pert and promising screen personality , her feline beauty , and her exceptional charisma shine through gloriously and make these minutes the most watchable , memorable , and exciting moments in the entire film . if you would value an opportunity to see a tremendous young talent on the rise , then check out miss mitzi gaynor in " my blue heaven . " 

incidentally , i scorn ( and would urge you to avoid ) drew casper ' s manic , obsessive-compulsive dvd commentary for this film . wordy , digressive , unduly fastidious , frequently ill-timed with what is playing on the screen , and galloping throughout with an excess of nervous energy , his comments are absolutely indigestible .  i kind of like jag . it do have itÂ´s charm but lately itÂ´s to much propaganda in it . for an outsider ( a non american ) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much . 

i donÂ´t like that rabb and mackenzie goes from being lawyers ( as they were in the early parts of the tv show ) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents . its almost like watching a recruitment video from the us army . 

i still watch the show , so itÂ´s not that bad . but i would prefer more episodes when rabb and mackenzie investigates military accidents and donÂ´t save the world in the future .  this was my very first " bollywood " movie and i found it in the same way many other recent viewers did -- through " ghost world " . having done a little bit of reading up on the film industry of bollywood this week , i understand somewhat why there are seemingly unrelated musical numbers and romance and comedy in a horror film . but " something for everyone " doesn ' t always add up to a cohesive product . 

the ultra-groovy musical dance number " jaan pehechaan ho " has captivated the world in a way it probably could not have done in 1965 . it ' s all over the internet now , with many folks scrambling for a good english translation . laxmi chhaya does an amazing job dancing take after take , making it all look fresh , new and fun even when any normal person would be exhausted ! she rules ! 

on the beach with miss kitty is a light-weight fun and pretty tune in total contrast to the horror plot . still , i find myself singing it in hindi a week later . i found a rough translation : 

if you want to live in this life then listen to what i say leave your sorrows behind and join the party take my advice

those who want to live live with laughter and singing let your hair down and relax people of this world what do you know ? come to me and i ' ll explain

whoever there is who will see me will stop worrying in this world fish swim freely here and there

my second favorite number in the film is the butler ' s dream where mehmood is entranced by miss kitty ' s dancing . the electric tiki-like idols are just wonderfully tacky as is the entire set of this number . online , i ' d seen it described as what would happen if " liberace threw up " ! ! way fun . 

gumnaam is not a good movie as a whole . that ' s why i gave it a rating of 3 . it ' s actually a real stinker of a film with some fun , kitschy musical numbers that have nothing really to do with the murder plot .  the good things first : i agree with another viewer who said that gene raymond has a marvelous drunk scene . he does -- i was tickled to finally get a chance to laugh . and there were other moments i found amusing -- raymond ' s parents in the bathroom with the defective plumbing , and the scene in the restaurant with robert montgomery trying to make carole lombard jealous by mouthing sweet nothings to a stranger . 

but overall , i was dismayed . i love carol lombard and most of hitchcock . and i understand the restrictions laid on productions by the hays code . but this was embarrassing and awful to watch . of course i knew they ' d end up together , this is a romantic comedy after all . but it made no sense , it happened too fast . plus i can ' t believe the professions of love when confronted with such hurtful behavior , both physical and confrontational .  a depressed creepy teenager does many bad things to a socially active older lady who does not like to use shades or drapes in her windows . he steels assorted things from her , peeps at her , does prank calls , and plays assorted unpleasant tricks on her . oddly , he keeps none of this a secret from her . at first , she does not seem to care one way or the other that he is bothering her . then later she seems to begin to respect him for his cruel fevered activities . 

there are some illogical items to note . one is that the guy peeps into the night through a pane of glass from the more brightly lit side . in real life such a thing would not happen . the more brightly lit side of a pane of glass acts as a mirror . he would be able to see exactly nothing . also , everyone out in the night would be able to look inside at him sitting in his well lit room . 

one other illogical item is that the creepy teen takes a job as a milkman , and his one and only customer each morning seems to be the lady he is picking on . easy work , if you can get it . 

i saw a short film about love at a public showing . by the end , there was not a single open eye in the house . a short film about love is the foreign language movie for those who do not like reading subtitles . not only are there very few words spoken in the film , but much of the movie is silent . a certain rest in peace .  yet another lo wei production to completely waste the talents of a young jackie chan , to kill with intrigue is a strange mix of wuxia , melodrama , supernatural action , and plain old-school kung fu fighting that is pretty dull despite featuring several surreal wtf moments and lots of laughably bad dialogue . 

in an effort to protect his pregnant girlfriend chin chin from the killer bees , a gang of ruthless killers that are about to attack his home , cao lei ( jackie chan ) pretends to be a heartless cad , driving her away , and thus saving her from danger . 

during the attack , cao ' s relatives are all killed , but he is left relatively unharmed by the gang , whose leader , a scar-faced woman , seems to have the hots for him . cao then goes in search of chin chin , whose safety he has entrusted to his close friend chu chuk . 

during his quest to find his true love , cao befriends the head of a courier company whose precious cargo has been stolen by the leader of the evil ' bloody rain ' clan . eventually , after being injured in a fight against members of the nasty clan ( a fun scene with lots of silly weaponry ) , and then nursed back to health by the scar-faced killer bee ( who shows her love by burning his face ! ) , cao ultimately learns that he is a lousy judge of character : his friend , chu chuk , is none other than the power hungry head honcho of the ' bloody rain ' clan , who has plans to marry chin chin himself . 

cue the drawn out climactic battle , with cao getting kicked in the face repeatedly before eventually choking his traitorous ex-pal to death with a scarf . 

even die hard chan fans will find this one a chore to sit through , with only the final fight managing to showcase some of the star ' s amazing acrobatic abilities . fans of general asian weirdness might dig the spooky appearance of the killer bees at the beginning of the film ( with one character inexplicably demanding back his severed hand ! ) , or the moment when three men float through a window to attack our hero , but , for most , this film will have very limited appeal .  very disturbing , but expertly crafted & scripted and intelligently directed with a good eye for color and detail . mary beth hurt , sandy dennis , and especially randy quaid are unusually good . the story centers around a young boy ( bryan madorsky ) wondering where all the leftovers they eat every night comes from . his parents ( hurt , quaid ) strange behavior causes the school psychiatrist ( dennis ) to get involved . it is a gruesome cannibal movie . but it ' s not bad . if you like hannibal , you ' ll love this . if you don ' t like parents , stay away from the film . just giving advice to cannibal lover and haters . 

rated r for strong adult themes and graphic violence .   " two wildlife photographers are traveling through the amazon river basin on their latest assignment . while trying to capture the wildlife of the area on film , our photographers cross paths with a game hunter , who is stalking the animals for another reason . looking to eliminate the witnesses to his illegal activities , the hunter decides to " according to the dvd sleeve ' s synopsis . 

handsome guide peter brown ( as jim pendrake ) takes pretty blonde ahna capri ( as terry greene ) and her good-looking brother tom simcox ( as art greene ) into the venezuelan jungle , to admire the view , and take wildlife pictures . after they hook up with hunky big-game hunter william smith ( as caribe ) , psychological dramatics surface . 

a pivotal scene , with mr . brown reposing in the " vee " of a tree , and sharing a cigarette with mr . simcox , is nicely staged . the circular direction reappears in the later " fight " between brown and mr . smith ; and , it is effective . simcox ' early sex romp adds nothing to the story ; it could have been cut , to take advantage of what seems like flirting between the brown and simcox characters . an attraction between brown and ms . capri could have been played up , also . 

the music , including jim stein ' s " love all things that love the sun " , is fine ; but the film needs to be re-tracked , to cut out animals which do not appear on screen . and , there is far too much superfluous footage on display . " piranha " is a case where less would have been more .  i love the book . it ' s full of passion , romance , tension . . . and the movie drags along taking two spunky stars with it . kylie minogue was already a major star in australia , having starred in neighbours and releasing her first single . the decision to cast her in the delinquents was surely a marketing ploy . for me , it didn ' t pay off . 

kylie may have been great in neighbours , but she was far too sweet and innocent to play the feisty lola . . . and , she wasn ' t of asian descent as lola was . charlie schlatter was an excellent brownie , but there was no chemistry between him and kylie . 

by and large , the movie was boring . it dragged on , it lacked the passion of the book , it focused heavily on kylie and in general , was completely disappointing .  this movie received a great write up in blockbusters ' coming attraction ' i was looking forward to the release date , 08 / 07 / 02 . the plot sounds reasonable , the cast alone should have guaranteed a side-splitter , but whoa there ; apart from the ' off the wall betting events ' this was quite a bore . 

this will never become a comedy classic , and i ' m afraid it has done no help to the fine comedy reputation of john cleese . rowan atkinson , now he was quite funny , in a rowan atkinson sort of way !  when i first saw a glimpse of this movie , i quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of lucille ball . rachel york ' s portrayal of lucy is absolutely awful . lucille ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent . to think about a legend like lucille ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous . i cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better lucy , the producers decided to get rachel york . she might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of lucille ball is tough . it is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble lucille ball , but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent . if you noticed york ' s portrayal of lucy in episodes of i love lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin , nothing is similar in any way-her expression , voice , or movement . 

to top it all off , danny pino playing desi arnaz is horrible . pino does not qualify to play as ricky . he ' s small and skinny , his accent is unreal , and once again , his acting is unbelievable . although fred and ethel were not similar either , they were not as bad as the characters of lucy and ricky . 

overall , extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told . if people want to understand the real life situation of lucille ball , i suggest watching a & e biography of lucy and desi , read the book from lucille ball herself , or pbs ' american masters : finding lucy . if you want to see a docudrama , " before the laughter " would be a better choice . the casting of lucille ball and desi arnaz in " before the laughter " is much better compared to this . at least , a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing .  if you never have read the book and never intend to read it in the future , go on and watch the movie ( 6 / 10 ) . it is a nice fantasy movie with well done cgi , nice acting , a beautiful environment and an above-average fantasy story . 

if you have read the book like me about 10 times or more and really love it , don ' t expect too much ( or better : don ' t expect anything at all ) . the story is totally different from the original book . this may explain that the movie is voted 1 / 10 from people around 40 or more ( like me ) and much better from people who most probably never read the book before and thus expect nothing . 

most of the differences between movie and book are not really necessary and change the setting ( in my opinion much to the worse ) : 

- the magic in the book works with rituals for classic magical effects . ( changing weather , creating illusions , transform into animals , . . . ) in the movie the magic is more like " jedi-school for the middle ages " ( tm ) ( wooden sticks instead of lightsabers ) . that the devil is looking like emperor palpatine ( after part iii ) doesn ' t make it really better . 

- the mill in the book is not totally cut off the world like in the movie . in the book the story is set near dresden , which krabat visits one time with his master and also he visits some nearby villages for festivities . ( this part might have been changed to cut costs . ) i also don ' t understand why in the movie the mill is located in the hills while the nearby graveyard is set in the high mountains . 

- the whole surrounding is the average run of the mill fantasy medieval style . lots of mud everywhere , dirty faces , not an orderly kitchen , only very rough houses . the book never suggested such an environment . 

- in the book the master tries to make krabat his successor but krabat rejects . krabat is somewhere between admiration , distance and silent rejection . in the movie krabat rejects the master always openly like a stubborn schoolboy . 

- the movie is set in 1647 instead of around 1720 . this makes it impossible for the master to tell some stories from his youth probably around 170x . ok , the stories are missing anyway in the movie . 

also some explanations given in the book would have been helpful and would not cost so much minutes : 

- in the book all work done at day is effortless and work in the night is like normal work . this explanation is missing in the movie . sometimes the boys are sweating and sometimes they are happy . 

- the book explains why only a few " gesellen " try to confront the master : if the master dies by any mundane reasons , the " gesellen " are free and keep their magical powers . if the master dies at the confrontation , all will lose their power forever .  this film seems well made , and more efforts should be made to promote films by women . that aside , this film is also profoundly disturbing in that it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character that is profoundly disturbed . if you ' ve seen any of the promotional material , you might think this is a poignant film about a relationship that ' s reached its end , but none of that suggests how really disturbing the central premise is : 

a woman threatens suicide unless her soon to be ex agrees to relive here most treasured memories of their relationship . when told how unfair ( to say the least ) that such a threat is , tessa ( the purported protagonist ) suggests that " life ' s not fair . " 

huh ? ? ? this character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover into staying , and coaxes him into sexually oriented behavior ( which she initially denies as a motive ) all the while assuring him " this isn ' t sex . " 

reverse the genders , have the leads played by tracey gold and brian austin-green and this could air in feature length on lifetime with a title like " hostage to obsession . " there is no medically accepted definition of sound mental and emotional stability that would encompass tessa ' s behavior in this film . 

props to kristen thomson for playing a border-line psychotic , manipulative ex to a t , perhaps too well because there is no well-adjusted person , male or female , who could watch this and not have shivers run up their spine .  michael bassett ' s film ' solomon kane ' ( based on the character of the same name created by robert e . howard ) is a disappointing fantasy action-adventure film , that despite having a few scenes of genius falls flat with its awkward pacing , poor characterisation and general dullness . solomon kane ( james purefoy ) is a mercenary of queen elizabeth ' s army fighting in africa , where he comes face-to-face with the devil ' s reaper Â a demon who collects the devil ' s debts i . e . souls Â refusing to go to hell just yet , he evades the reaper and starts a new life in an english monastery . with this new life , solomon has left-behind his culture of violence and bloodshed and instead now embraces the values of peace and non-values . but once he is expelled from the monastery due to the fear of the devil ' s reaper returning , he must travel back to his home in devon and along the way he befriends a travelling family of puritans heading to the new world . on their journey through the british counties , the family is attacked , and their daughter meredith ( rachel hurd-wood ) is abducted by the evil sorcerer malachi ' s army , which is lead on the front lines by the mysterious masked rider . now a man of peace , solomon must go back to his former life as a man of unrepentant violence and destruction to save meredith . 

despite having great source material to work from , and build upon to create potentially an exciting and enduring medieval action-adventure film , the film fails in three key areas . the pacing of this film is terrible , which may have a lot to do with its incredibly short run time of only one hour and forty minutes ( and this is most likely a consequence of the fact that they wish to turn this film into a trilogy ) . constantly jumping between of drama and self-characterisation to that of action and muddy bloodshed , somewhat kills the excitement of the action sequences . instead of keeping the audience on the edge of their seats frothing with the eagle-eyed anticipation , the film instead feels incredibly subdued and , this follows on the next piece of criticism , dull . despite being touted as an ' action-adventure ' film or in some circles an ' action-epic ' , ' solomon kane ' is almost most certainly not . the action is mundane and dull , and is generally finished before you have the chance to admire the beauty of a decapitation . finally , aside from solomon himself , there is very little characterisation within this film . for example we know little and because of this , care little , about the young woman that soloman sets out on his journey to save . and i imagine again the filmmaker would refer this criticism to the fact that there is most likely going to be a second film which will hopefully touch upon these aspects that this film surely missed . 

it isn ' t an entirely terrible film however . james purefoy is gives a fantastic performance as solomon , the mercenary who must decide whether or not to fall back on his conscience or his blade , and how his decisions will impact not just upon himself , but those around him as well . while respect , admiration , and acknowledgement must also go to bassett and his crew as well , for creating vivid locations that beautifully reflects the period in which they are filming . at times , it is hard not to get carried away with admiring the beauty of the locations , shot composition and mise-en-scene at show here . which certainly shows that a lot of time and effort has been placed into this film , unfortunately however that is not to say the same for the story and characters at hand . ' solomon kane ' certainly had the potential to be something more than simply an ' action-epic , ' however it seems that once again the lack of any real depth in the story and characters has resulted in michael bassett creating nothing more than a one-dimensional look at swordplay during the medieval period .  i ' m not a big fan of musicals , although this technically might not qualify as a musical . but i thought i would give it a chance as i love war movies . it was mediocre at best . 

hudson seems totally out of kilter in this role . it just didn ' t work for me . julie andrews probably played her part as best as she could , but i just find it hard to buy her as a conniving , deceptive spy . sorry , i know that is classic stereotyping on my part . but i have to say i think this is julie at her most beautiful and feminine looking . i always thought of her as more matronly , but then surely that ' s a result of her roles in sound of music and mary poppins . no doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of that typecasting in this role . she was quite beguiling in appearance here , but i still didn ' t buy her as a spy . 

i couldn ' t keep my focus through the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out - and having conversations with those in my room ( which i usually never do - i ' m always shushing everybody ) . so that tells you how little it held my attention . don ' t waste your time !  although this movie is inaccurate overall , there are some items that may be true . certainly , he was a wild character in his youth , having played practical jokes on his fellow cadets at west point , almost expelled several times , graduating last in his class ( of 34 ) , and often reckless in his leadership during the civil war . 

but history may have made him a scape goat of the indian wars . certainly , he did his share of cruel things , but how much was he under orders ? also , there is evidence that he testified before congress ( at great risk to his commission and command ) that he argued about the fairness of breaking treaties with the indians and that if he was an indian he would also fight rather than live on a reservation ! 

as a character said in the play 1776 when asked what will be said about the british about losing the revolutionary war , the character states " history will do what it always does . . . it will lie . " who knows how bad a man custer was . certainly he wasn ' t the sympathetic character as portrayed by errol flynn and later by ronald reagan . but i also doubt he was completely evil as he is later portrayed .  much praise has been lavished upon farscape , but i don ' t think it ' s that good . it certainly has a distinctive look , but it lacks just about everything else : story , purpose , direction , excitement ; you name it . i ' m a big sci-fi fan , and i make it a point to watch all the sci-fi shows i can . i ' ve almost finished the four seasons of farscape , and at this point i ' m not very satisfied . the show does have a few good things - most notably claudia black ( who ' s sadly missing from the first few episodes of season four ) - , but they are very few and very far between . as a whole the show is marred by a lot of very silly stuff ( such as fantasy elements rather than sf ditto ) , and many many episodes , esp . in season four , are unspeakably messy and very poorly structured . and one just feels that it isn ' t going anywhere . it ' s mostly just non-directional adventures with thin , long-running plot lines which develop painstakingly slowly . well , sometimes it ' s a little bit tighter , but it only lasts for a very few episodes at a time . 

effects-wise , there are a few impressive things here and there ( esp . out in space , occasionally ) , but the show seems stuck in the same style of effects , which frankly gets old fast . outlandish and unconvincing puppet aliens mar the show a great deal , and i ' ve come to prefer ( by far ) the episodes where regular human-looking characters are the focus . 

i think the peacekeepers are by far the most stylish and intriguing and interesting figures on the show ; they succeed in being a convincingly alien culture , despite their all-human appearance . there are a few really cool episodes with them , esp . in the first season ( iirc ) , where crichton masquerades as a peacekeeper captain , and invades and eventually destroys one of their secret bases . such episodes can reach a rating of 8 out of 10 , but i cannot award the show as a whole more than a " 4 " rating . 

aside from the peacekeepers ( which themselves are somewhat too single-mindedly totalitarian and militaristic to be really nuanced ) , the show simply doesn ' t offer anything important or significant that you need to know or want to see . otoh , it does contain a few good ideas and is not a total loss . 

this is just my opinion , of course , but as a seasoned sci-fi fan , i think it counts for something , and may be of help to others . there aren ' t a lot of good sci-fi shows out there ; but star trek ( any series ) and especially the new battlestar galactica are definitely better than farscape . but if you ' re a huge fan of mediocre sci-fi shows , you may well like farscape , too . 

my rating : 4 out of 10 .  i like a lot of myrna loy movies . this film was produced before her character actor personality was developed . it would be an okay short film but seems to go on forever in it ' s complete form . 

myrna loy it seems is told what to do with her acting and does the job . that is about all you can say about her . 

her gypsy character is shoddy and the film has many flaws , such as the jewelry shop scene . 

this film will probably be interesting to myrna loy fans but even as such is something of a disappointment .  publicity for this film suggests that it is shocking and sensational . well , we opera lovers see some strange sights in opera houses so we are not shocked by the duke of mantua urinating during his reprise of la donna Ã¨ mobile , nor is it sensational to see gilda sing caro nome in the bath . it is just crass and boring . what stands out about this film is its lack of imagination . director corina van eijk sets the duke ' s palace in a seedy swimming pool . in fact , he is not the duke , he is just a character named duka , so it ' s difficult to see why he has lots of hangers-on and his own jester , rigoletto . rigoletto lives in a council flat that is furnished with the orange sofa and decorated in the spotted wallpaper that is de rigeur among avant-garde directors . the duke ' s , sorry duka ' s heavies ride around on motor scooters ( yawn ) . 

concepts imposed on an opera like this can produce unexpected , and unintentional humour . what can we make of the fact that gilda has a maid , even though she lives in a council flat . ? when the call goes out that monterone is being taken to prison we see him being marched out of the swimming pool by two attendants in pink shorts . one imagines that he is going to be charged with urinating in a public swimming pool . 

it was common for opera films to be lip-synced 20 years ago but there is just no excuse for it today . a dubbed opera is like soft porn . you don ' t believe in what is happening because the performers are not making enough effort . the actress in gilda ' s role does not seem to have learned her lines properly . she barely moves her lips when she is supposed to be singing . when she sings caro nome in the bath she lies back with her legs slightly parted . it is difficult to tell which orifice the sound is supposed to be emanating from . the duke , later caps this by singing while engaging in cunnilingus with maddalena , giving a new meaning to the phrase yodelling in the canyon . 

the ambiance of the sound never seems right with the orchestra sometimes sounding as though it is being played through a transistor radio . fairly slow , rumpity-tumpity tempi are preferred so that the overall effect is of a karaoke in your local pub . 

this is a film of a production by opera spanga . spanga is a village in friesland in the netherlands . they normally perform in a tent in a field . if i had been watching this performance in a tent in a field in friesland i would have been fairly indulgent . by filming this production and giving it a worldwide audience , the villagers also hold themselves open to worldwide ridicule .  world war i gets a glossy , sepia-tinted makeover in jean-pierre jeunet ' s relentlessly whimsical " a very long engagement " . jeunet ' s trademark style consists of mechanical , almost clockwork-like narrative construction garnished with lavish , chocolate box production values and seasoned with faux-naive humour . it ' s an approach that worked pretty well with his previous picture , the romantic fantasy " amelie " , thanks in no small part to the inimitable contribution of audrey tatou in the title role . applied to vastly more sombre material , jeunet ' s method backfires rather badly . 

tatou crops up again here in a variation on the same sort of sweetly off-beat character as amelie . she ' s mathilde , an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting , determined to trace what became of her child sweetheart manech ( gaspard ulliel ) , several years after he went missing in the war . manech was one of five soldiers court-martialled for self-mutilation in 1917 at ' bingo crepuscule ' , and sent over the top into no-man ' s-land as a punishment . he ' s presumed dead by all but mathilde who cherishes the hope of finding him . the film follows mathilde ' s dogged quest to find out what really happened , and as she delves deeper she uncovers a sad , even shocking story of high-ranking corruption and inhumanity . mathilde must filter the facts from the fictions that arise from various conflicting , overlapping or incomplete accounts of what seem to be manech ' s final hours . 

all this should be poignant and gripping , but it ' s more often simply confusing thanks to the visual and verbal clutter with which jeunet pummels his audience . there ' s simply too much going on at any one time , including an intrusive narration that adds precisely nothing to our appreciation of the story and characters . without a moment ' s respite from informational overload , i felt denied the space to reflect on mathilde ' s quest or the room to engage with it on my own terms . jeunet ' s unceasingly busy camera spirals and swoops and circles , caressing every surface contour of his exquisitely designed production , but it singularly fails to penetrate to the soul beneath the story ' s skin . the result is deeply uninvolving , and worse , grotesque . the first world war was a particularly dark hour in human history . imagine it re-created as one of those picturesque commercials for a well known belgian lager , and you have the measure of this film .   " solomon and sheba " was the kind of film that you just had to go and see back in the late 50 ' s when i was a kid : a biblical epic spectacular with well known performers , unusual costumes , lots of extras and battle sequences . so i went to see it ; but i remember that back then " solomon and sheba " didn ' t impress me at all , which was a strange thing since i had enjoyed a lot " the ten commandments " , " quo vadis " , " helen of troy " and others . the point is that when you are a kid you disregard things in pictures that adults don ' t ( bad acting , for instance ) and you are easier to please with warriors in their armors , battles , sword duels and action , so if your ' e not impressed then something is wrong with a product of this genre . 

this film , though it has some of such features , is definitely standard and average . yul brynner ' s wooden performance as the hebrew king doesn ' t even light when he has voluptuous and half naked gina lollobrigida dancing around him provocatively . she is better and renders an acceptable acting . george sanders doesn ' t look interested in what he is doing , and marisa pavan ( pier angeli ' s twin sister ) doesn ' t add at all as a sort of brynner ' s conscience . 

the final sword duel between brynner and sanders is just for the plot and lacks interest and intensity ( it had to filmed , that ' s all ) . 

not a good farewell for director king vidor , solomon and sheba will probably be remembered as ty power ' s last unfinished picture .  dare rudd ( john wayne ) and sidekick dink hooley ( syd saylor ) are itinerant cowpunchers who can ' t seem to stay in one place very long . in " helltown " , the boys are headed to montana , where they meet up with rudd ' s cousin tom fillmore ( johnny mack brown ) , who offers them a job . it ' s a hoot to see the boys wearing aprons as they start out as cooks with the herd , although dare becomes self conscious when miss judith ( marsha hunt ) rides into camp . judy is tom ' s girl , but the attraction between her and dare is evident early on . 

fillmore has a cattle herd to move , and promotes dare to running the drive , partly to prove to judy that he may not be up to the task . meanwhile , bad guy bart hammond ( monte blue ) has his eyes on fillmore ' s cattle , but when his henchmen fail to rustle the herd , he figures it ' s easier to win the money that dare was paid at the end of the trail . conning dare into a rigged card game with his man brady ( james craig ) , dare ' s money begins to evaporate hand after hand . it ' s only when dare fails to show up back at fillmore ' s ranch that tom goes out to find his cousin . exposing the cheats , tom , dare and dink high tail it before the bad guys can get their revenge . 

 " helltown " , also known as " born to the west " , was released in 1937 by favorite films corporation , a couple of years after wayne ' s series of westerns for lone star productions . it only slightly alters the lone star formula ; wayne does get the girl at the end of the film , but here he was trying . there ' s a great runaway horse scene where wayne rescues marsha hunt , in which johnny mack brown ' s horse does a complete somersault spill . syd saylor does a nice job as the comic relief pal , doing his best to sell lightning rods to unsuspecting victims . he replaces familiar faces george " gabby " hayes and yakima canutt here , staples of the lone star films . john wayne ' s charisma is beginning to develop here , preparing him for the leap to super star status that he eventually achieved . 

 " helltown " was based on a novel by legendary western author zane grey . if you ' re looking for more films based on grey ' s stories , try " fighting caravans " with gary cooper , " the light of western stars " with victor jory , " drift fence " with buster crabbe , and " heritage of the desert " with randolph scott .  after all the hype i had heard about the jane austin novel and different film versions of the book i found myself very disappointed with the movie . i had expected a classic drama but that was not the case . first of all let me preface my review with the fact that i love old movies , particularly mysteries and dramas , but not female oriented movies . this probably makes a huge difference , so take my review with a large grain of salt . i thought the acting was a bit over the top , but that is very common in movies of this era . june allyson was good as jo but i found every sister to be stereotypical and form driven . there were no surprises or overly dramatic moments . i hate writing negative reviews , but the movie left me very cold . it has always been my intention to read the book , but after this that seem unlikely . the only warming story line was between the old gentlemen and the youngest sister , that was a very welcome bright spot in an otherwise disappointing viewing experience . again there are others who love this movie , i ' m just not one of them .  has some really good music and performances ; kid creole and the coconuts , james white and the blacks , dna , tuxedo moon , the plastics , melle mel , vincent gallo , lydia lunch . . . etc , but aside from this there isn ' t much more to it . the dialog , especially the narration ( by saul williams ) , is actually pretty good , but the performances are all pretty bland or outright bad , no matter how many hipsters are thrown in ; debbie harry and jean micheal basquit ( the latter being the leading role ) both still don ' t have enough cultural cred to keep this film from being a novelty item . it goes for the a jack kerouac style roving spontaneity , but doesn ' t have the insight to keep it moving along , which is where the band performances come in . i guess its pretty balanced in that regard between great music and bad acting , and i did enjoy it , but i just expected more . though it does have a fairy tale ending .  in the aftermath of september 11th in new york , this drama about american firefighters was conceived as a salute and tribute to their professionalism . the story is told with a series of flashbacks , where after firefighter jack morrison ( joaquin phoenix ) has crashed through the floor of a burning building , and only communicating with captain mike kennedy ( john travolta ) via the radio . the flashbacks basically show how jack grows from being a recruit , seeing kennedy as a father figure , to being a firehouse legend . of course , in the present day , jack ' s fellow firefighters are trying to reach him , but they are too late , and in the end , he lets them leave him , and it forwards to his funeral , where he is praised as one of the best firefighters they have known . also starring jacinda barrett as linda morrison , terminator 2 ' s robert patrick as lenny richter , morris chestnut as tommy drake , billy burke as dennis gauquin , balthazar getty as ray gauquin and tim guinee as tony corrigan . the blazes of the film are ultimately all i could pay attention to and enjoy seeing the characters tackle them , the rest is a bit too chatty for my liking . adequate !  an epic story of hope constrained by budget and limited artistic ambition . seeing as terrence malick produced this , i expected something haunting and lyrical . instead , we get a typical norwegian co-production ( " revolution " with al pacino , anyone ? ) , where - quite possibly - good intentions are scuppered by a dreadful screenplay , and where many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes . the " me-tarzan-you-jane " english dialogue between the non-english-speaking protagonists is particularly cringeworthy Â one could speculate whether nick nolte and tim roth ad-libbed their own , as they almost sound like real people . the story is loaded with implausibility : we are expected to believe that binh can speak a smattering of english after having spent his entire life living as a peasant slave ( his vocabulary , but unfortunately not grammatical command , increases impressively in the malayan refugee camp , without the benefit of night classes ) . coincidence is rife ; i wonder whether an hour or two has been edited from the first third : he tracks down his mother in ho chi minh city almost immediately - after bumping into his thirty year younger half brother , who nonchalantly recognises him ! mum gives him a gold locket ( or something similar of great value ) as they part , but this is never referred to again . his relationship with " me dead inside " ling is supposed to provide the obligatory " love interest " , but feels as artificial as leonardo and cameron in " gangs of new york " . 

the voyage in the rust bucket of a boat does convey a sense of the appalling conditions that human trafficking entails . indeed , the only time the film is remotely exciting and unpredictable , is the jerky , hand-held footage shot from the bridge during choppy weather conditions . ( incidentally , a boat cruise from malaysia to new york via the cape of good hope and the african coast , without stopping for fuel or supplies , is certainly an epic journey ) . the beautiful shot of the new york skyline echoes malick ' s use of magic hour , but i want to know why the coast guard didn ' t show up . perhaps they were watching the super bowl , or something . of course , binh manages to track down his blind old dad on a remote farm in texas , with the same navigational flair he displayed in ho chi minh city . i was impressed at how nick nolte could wander around digging fields and feeding horses on a large ranch without the aid of a guide dog or white stick . for demonstration of how a story about the travails befalling refugees could be structured and shot on a small budget , check out michael winterbottom ' s far superior " in this world " .  for one thing , he produced this movie . it has the feel of later movies with international casts that are dubbed . the opening credits tell us it was filmed in vienna . 

bey was a delight in the universal adventure movies of the 1940s . he was also superb in a movie i saw maybe ten years ago but have never heard of since : " the amazing mr . x . " maybe it was dr . x . i remember it as a thrilling and frightening movie . 

this one is pretty wooden , unfortunately . the plot isn ' t easy to follow . when i got the hang of it , i was disappointed anyway . 

francis lederer looks great as a concert pianist . he was a very handsome leading man ten or 15 years earlier . he never really caught on as a major star , though he should have . 

this isn ' t terrible but it ' s pretty heavy going .  i just saw a terrible film called the sleeping dictionary . one reviewer on four word film review ( www . fwfr . com ) got it right right when he wrote , " from a to zzzzzzzzz . " the story is about an english colonialist jerk that comes to malaysia to " civilize the savages " so to speak and ends up falling in love with his sleeping dictionary . a sleeping dictionary is a native malaysian prostitute fluent in english that services englishmen colonialists and teaches them her native language in return for . . . well the movie never really makes that clear , but i can only assume he gives her money or something . needless to say , the movie focuses a lot more on the " sleeping " part than on the " dictionary " part of the job description . things get complicated for our young hero when the forbidden love affair gets compounded by her culture , his soap opera domestic situation , and his own boundless stupidity in every major decision he makes throughout the film . 

so yes , the movie has some major flaws , but on the other hand , it delivered exactly the two things i rented it for in the first place : a beautifully photographed exotic location , and an even more beautifully photographed and exotic woman that plays the sleeping dictionary , jessica alba . my friend told me that this crappy movie was her at her most beautiful and damn was he right . she ' s not a great actress , and doesn ' t quite pass for malaysian , and its pretty obvious that they use a body double for the nudity , but who cares ? jessica alba has that rare face and figure that ' s more than just sexy , but also beautiful in the way that a vivaldi violin concerto or a rembrandt painting is . 

 ( p . s . sorry to all you feminists out there who discourage objectifying women , the " male gaze , " etc . etc . , but i hope you can understand that i mean no disrespect . )  this was one of christie ' s later stories . throughout her long career , she was interested in the shifting narrative and the notion of conflicting agents . both are essentially the same thing and boil down to questions of who it is that controls or creates the situation . 

in detective fiction , the game is a matter of conflicting realities . the murderer intends to change reality to fool the detective , the writer intends to do the same to the reader . both the reader and the detective are in similar battles to create what they see . that ' s why her stories often include a writer . 

in her works , she explores every combination of tricks she can think of that deal with this . along the way , we often have bodies that are not who they seem , and times , and intended victims and such . but the real magic of the books is this notion of control . in ' bertram ' s ' it was literally a building . 

here , it is a dead man . well , sometimes that happens , but not like this . it is as if the writer were the famous mr . rafiel . this is particularly sweet to marple readers who remember this same character from the ' carribean mystery , ' which in a way was also framed by her nephew . in that story , rafiel was the conveyor of the story to the authorities . 

the producers of this series have an almost wacky commitment to using a different creative team on each one . sometimes it produces bland work . the ' bertram ' s ' episode was rather brilliantly staged . this one is the most lavish of the lot , and has an active camera . but unlike the ' bertram ' s ' work , it has nothing to do with the story . 

the camera moves and captures merely because it can . the ' citizen kane ' quote at the beginning was a little too literal and blunt . this story is good , but the adapter took out some pretty critical stuff , and that irrelevant camera annoys . 

ted ' s evaluation -- 2 of 3 : has some interesting elements .  ok , we were going along with the stereotypical bad orphanage experience and explaining to our son , adopted from russia , that this was over-the-top acting and dramatization , so we could get to the dog playing soccer ( since he plays soccer ) . but the last scene , in which the dog goes back to his original owner put my son over the edge and he cried for 15-20 minutes , " he ' s been replaced ! ! ! ! " this from an elementary child . i do not recommend this movie to any family that has an adopted child ; it displays adoption , orphanages and adults badly--and in the end , even though they win the game--the dog that the boy bonded with has to leave--and this is too much . please be wary if you have any adopted children , and beware families with biological children , because the impression of children who are adopted is not positive and paints a stereotype that is unhealthy and nasty . ( the dog is cute , but not enough to save our family ' s reaction to this movie . . . . )  susan slept here turned out to be dick powell ' s swan song as a performer on the big screen . of course he directed some more films and appeared frequently on television until he died . it ' s a pity he didn ' t go out with his performance in the bad and the beautiful . 

frank tashlin has done so many better films , i ' m still not sure whatever possessed him to do this one . the premise is absolutely laughable . 

dick powell is a screenwriter who ' s looking to do more serious stuff than the fluff he ' s been writing . he had an idea for a film on juvenile delinquency so two friendly cops in herb vigran and horace mcmahon deposit 17 year old debbie reynolds on his doorstep . she ' s not a really bad kid and they don ' t want to put her in the system . so they give her to dick powell at christmas time . 

i mean is there anyone out there who doesn ' t see a problem ? the term jailbait comes immediately to mind . additionally powell has a girlfriend , the young and sexy anne francis . why debbie reynolds is any competition here is beyond me . 

susan slept here got one oscar nomination . the song hold my hand , sung by don cornell in the background , was nominated for best song , but lost to secret love . 

powell and reynolds do have some funny moments together and alvy moore as powell ' s factotum and les tremayne as his lawyer also get a few laughs . 

but it ' s not enough .  it ' s difficult to decide who or what is the target audience for this film . jean-pierre limousin presumably had the chance to explore the problems of amnesia on a serious level and opted instead to use it as an excuse to make a soft-porn movie . having seen , loved , admired and respected se souvenir des belles choses which explores memory loss - albeit as the result of alzheimer ' s - in a profound and heartbreaking way , not least in the luminous performance of isabelle carre i find that novo is an insult to se souvenirs . i have no problem with soft porn per se - and even if i had i ' d virtually have to give up going to movies so prevalent is it today - but i do have a problem with writers / directors who attempt to respectablise it by cloaking it as here in the guise of medical research . the sad thing is that fine actresses like julie gayet - so wonderful in clara et moi - and anna mouglalis - who seems to have hit into a double play after last week ' s le deluge and now this - are wasting their time on dross like this .  a multi-millionaire marries a female doctor . he hasn ' t worked in a day and she is devoted to her profession . he sees her off each day . something has got to give . 

our hero , henry fonda , finally decides to do something with his life . he becomes a salesman in a department store but is soon fired as poorer people need the job . in the meantime , dr . helen hunt , ( barbara stanwyck ) has given up her practice ? what ' s there to do ? 

kirk ( fonda ) buys a bankrupt hospital and the two shall now be happy aiding others while they eke out an existence . 

what ' s with the writing here ? when annoyed with her husband , dr . hunt says , " you ' ve been acting like gestapo . " this is supposed to be a comedy . hogwash . 

a very boring , tedious film . very little going on here .  elderbush gilch was a big disappointment for me . i ' d heared how great it was , how important it was . it just didn ' t strike me . it had a dim-witted story line , plus some moronic and sadistic native american characters that are thurroughly offensive by today ' s standards . while most of d . w . griffith ' s films have depth and intelegence , this one feels more like a formula-baised programme picture . 

i loved seeing lillian gish and mae marsh in pre-birth of a nation roles , plus some of the staging of the battle scenes were pretty good . acording to future griffith cameraman karl brown , audiences were standing on their seats and cheering once the cavalry comes riding in at the end . i felt nothing . and beleave me , i lve watching griffith ' s early work at biograph . this film just isn ' t what it used to be . 

the best thing about this film it that , for all of it ' s flaws , it has many of griffith ' s touches to it . he handles his principal actors pretty well , plus the scene where the indians are encircling the cabin it reminiscent to the climax of birth of a nation , a far superior film that would send shock waves across america a little over a year later .  very resistible but ultimately harmless film version of the children ' s literary classic which incorporates an animated portion in the style of mary poppins ( 1964 ) and bedknobs and broomsticks ( 1971 ) . the human cast is very distinguished - james mason , billie whitelaw , david tomlinson , joan greenwood , bernard cribbins - but their roles range from the miscast ( a 69 year-old mason as a thieving chimney-sweep ! ) to the inconsequential ( greenwood as a befuddled aristocrat ) to the bizarre ( whitelaw plays several ' exotic ' characters - including a circus performer , an old hag , a maid and a fairy - for no apparent reason ) . 

the animated segment of the film , handled by a group of east-european animators , is hardly inspired but mildly enjoyable in itself and , as usual , with this type of thing , there is an assortment of songs one has to put up with , one of which in particular is reprised far too often for its own good . the film was directed by noted character actor jeffries who had previously directed ( far more successfully ) other children ' s films namely the railway children ( 1970 ) and the amazing mr . blunden ( 1972 ; which i ' ve yet to watch myself but which was released some time ago on r2 dvd by anchor bay uk ) .   " in the sweltering summer of 1958 , the deuces , a gang of brooklyn toughs , find their turf threatened when the leader of a rival gang , the vipers , is released from prison . leon ( stephen dorff ) , the deuces ' leader , tries to guide his boys through bloody brawls to keep the vipers out . but when his brother ( brad renfro ) falls into a sultry - and dangerous - relationship with annie ( fairuza balk ) , the sister of a viper , and his own girlfriend is brutally attacked , leon and his gang are plunged into an all-out war to save his brother , his girl - and his neighborhood ! " according to the dvd sleeve description . this is definitely no " basketball diaries " . 

think of it as " west side story " getting hit over the head with baseball bats and steel pipes , stickball having left brooklyn with the dodgers . " deuces wild " has some cool hollywood sets , 1950s cars and soundtrack songs ; and , much of it is nicely photographed by john a . alonzo . the story and direction never get beyond these strengths , which enables the film to peak during its opening minutes , and proceed downhill . the cast looks good when you read the credits , but translates into an ageing , flabby mess of phony pompadours , blood , and brylcreem and one fright wig . a sense of sadness and regret permeates the production . 

 * * * deuces wild ( 5 / 3 / 02 ) scott kalvert ~ stephen dorff , brad renfro , fairuza balk , frankie muniz at least it is with this episode . here we have a time traveler , the professor from gilligan ' s island , no less , going back in time to 1865 . what does one do--why try to save lincoln of course ! no really interesting variations are rung on this old theme . as another reviewer has stated , this episode is particularly drab and unstylish , with little to suggest that " the professor " really is back in the 1860s . budget limitations are readily apparent , and the direction is stolid . john wilkes booth adds a spark but it remains a very flat production . we too often feel we are on stage sets , waiting for something clever to happen . there is a minor twist at the end , but i emphasize minor .  this film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts . even little things like flynn licking one stamp after another , when he almost certainly would have used a moistened sponge , is one of the annoying things . flynn was never tried of manslaughter or murder . he is not known to have caught his mother making love to another man , and is not known to have had an homosexual relationship with anybody , and he did not end up on skid row in sydney . he did not get his twopenny-halfpenny role in in the wake of the bounty by imposture and this role did not turn him into a well-dressed film star . 

this is just a mediocre film where the name of errol flynn has been tacked on just to sell more tickets and more videos .  unusually cold and silly drama from director sydney pollack . soapy plot revolves around adulterous couple perishing in a plane wreck , leaving their spouses to find eachother and connect on their own intimate level . romance-novel writing gets sluggish treatment , although i thought the performances by leads harrison ford and kristen scott-thomas were fine . slick production holds interest , even though the plot keeps covering the same ground , and never builds any emotional momentum . as a result , the climax in the airport is a big ' so what ? '  pluses : mary boland is delightfully on edge as always ( i never tire of her upper-crust zaniness , especially in " the women " and " pride and prejudice " ) . w . c . fields ' s brief role is fun , though the famous pool table scene stretches its welcome a bit because it seems to go on for ten minutes . the madcap antics of the film , typical of the period , are great . also , a nod to alison skipworth ' s wonderfully grounded hotel mistress ; i would love to see more of her ( she reminds me of marie dressler , another personality worthy of high praise ) . 

minuses : gracie allen . an irritating , unfunny presence whose annoyance went unmatched until the rise of adam sandler . that near-falsetto nasalness tinged with an accent of unknown origin gets old in her very first scene . this is the first of the burns-allen films i have seen and while i ( as a big classic comedy buff ) try to experience at least one film with every major comedy star , this is definitely one team i will not be calling upon again . her timing and interpretation of the material is totally off . a maddeningly mediocre talent . 

the bottom line : an ok comedy , but the gags are few and far between . and at only an hour long , you can expect that this is not an a grade hollywood comedy . recommended only for boland and fields fans who want to see all of their work .  this was hitchcock ' s third hollywood feature , and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency , turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in rebecca , to espionage thriller in foreign correspondent , and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the " screwball " pictures of the 1930s . 

hitchcock ' s formal method , on the other hand , had by now settled into something consistent , so much so that he was unable ( or at least unwilling ) to deviate from it . it was unwise then for him to step outside his usual genre , and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate . in rebecca it was actually great to see hitchcock constrained by his producer and the source text , forced to turn his technique to heavy gothic drama , but for mr and mrs smith there is a huge mismatch between form and content . in other words , hitchcock was no ernst lubitsch . 

first , let ' s look at the romantic angle . the best love scenes in hitchcock films were wild , passionate and slightly dangerous Â the " ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn ' t have ? " situation , and he was great at depicting that . this is something that makes a much earlier film , rich and strange , one of the few hitchcock non-thrillers that really works . hitch is not so good however when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story . a light , tender touch is required and hitch doesn ' t have it . 

secondly , take the comedy . of course , hitchcock films could be funny Â the lady vanishes is probably the best example Â but only when the jokes were sprinkled throughout the story . the master of suspense simply isn ' t enough of a comedy director to create a film that has funny bones . he cuts up scenes as he would in a thriller Â snappy opposing angles of people talking , inserted close-ups of hands and feet , point-of-view shots Â but doesn ' t allow for comic timing or focus on gags . for example , the business with carole lombard ' s dress bursting at the seems is shown to us with a couple of close-ups , but these are timed more as if he were revealing some crucial plot point , and have no comedic impact . occasionally hitchcock ' s style does roughly coincide with the comedy Â for example the arrangement of characters in the scene at the club , where robert montgomery tries to make it look as if he is with the attractive , sophisticated woman at the next table Â but such moments are few and far between . 

even the cast of mr and mrs smith are not up to standard . i ' m not sure this was robert montgomery ' s strength lay , and he is boring here . this was of course exactly where " queen of screwball " carole lombard ' s strength lay , and yet while she is clearly acting well the scenes are simply not geared to capturing comedy performances . even jack carson , who could be hilarious when he was really allowed to let go before the camera , fails to perk things up at all . of course , neither of these fine comedy actors is helped by the screenplay , which isn ' t exactly bursting with laughs in the first place , even if the basic story is a fairly good premise . 

the only full-on comedy hitchcock made after this was the trouble with harry , and that sort of worked because it played upon his familiar suspensefulness . however it was only when the story could exist independently of the humour , when the basic framework was suspense Â as it is in the lady vanishes or family plot Â that hitchcock was capable of doing comedy well .  chaplin was great a silent comedian , but many silent era stars fell when the public heard their voices in the first talkies . in my opinion , chaplin ' s voice simply did not fit his silent characters that made him rich and famous . his career never recovered when sound came to film . contrary to most of the reviews i have read , chaplin ' s lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average viewer who expected to be entertained by chaplin the comedian , and not spend their entertainment dollar watching chaplin ' s political commentary . 

despite chaplin ' s awards and knighthood , i would take exception to his " contributions " to humanity . the great dictator was made at the same time stalin ' s brutal dictatorship was having it ' s show trials , and both dictators signed the agreement that lead to invasion of poland by both dictators . wwii started in an attempt to save poland . the nazi ' s were defeated in 6 years , but poland disappeared as a sovereign country . this happened during the time this film was made and the investigations of hollywood by the federal government . had chaplin included joe stalin in this satire , in addition to including the italian dictator , perhaps he would have had less criticism about his politics by the politicians . the soviet ' s mistreatment of jews and dissidents exceeded the nazi ' s in time and numbers . 

judged simply as a film , many of the gags were too topical to be understood by younger viewers , who wouldn ' t know who goebbels , goring or mussolini were . a classic piece of art must stand the test of time . classic greek tragedy , the mona lisa and beethoven ' s 9th are still enjoyed centuries after their creation because they are timeless . films which rely on topical political commentary or currently popular social views usually do not outlast the generation in which they are made . but those that address issues that are common to all generations will probably live forever and receive a high rating from me . 

chaplin , as the writer , director and lead actor must take the blame for what i judge as a dated and tiresome film . 

chaplin ' s apologists have excused his decision to leave the country that made him rich and famous . if chaplin found the us so offensive , why didn ' t he return to his native land . great britian fought the nazi ' with blood and money . what did switzerland contribute in the fight against the european dictators ? switzerland is like a country club that picks and chooses its members based on race and class , and cares little about people who can ' t join the club .  shopping , sunny skies , beaches , boarding school for rich teenagers and perfectly happy endings . welcome to the life of zoey brooks and her friends . zoey brooks is portrayed by jamie lynn spears , the self proclaimed actress who got her claim to fame by being the younger sister of the international pop star britney spears . with her lovely blond wig in the first season and an attempt at hiding her monotonous country accent , it ' s confirmed that nickelodeon has indeed gone to the dogs with nepotism . when kristin herrera , the actress who portrayed dana cruz in the first season , left the show , all hope vanquished as she was the only decent actress . the female casting is a complete disgrace but the male casting has potential for a teenage media . if they continue to pursue jamie lynn spears as the picture of perfection , very many people will have to lower their standards . with hope , they will soon find that you can ' t make a career out of nothing . jamie lynn spears is useless for acting , singing and anything else she attempts for that downward spiral she calls a career . there is no wondering why she is a self-proclaimed actress . critics would most definitely proclaim her as something other than that .  this is a pretty simplistic romance . girl finds boy , girl loves boy , girl loses boy , girl finds boy . colleen moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe , delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic / romantic performance , well deserving of an oscar nom . equally fine are the aerial combat special effects . 

moore plays a french girl whose mother has turned over their field to a british aerial squadron during wwi . she is the " daughter of the regiment " , loved as a little sister . into this mix comes a fill-in for a downed flyer , gary cooper . at first they hate each other , then they love each other , then the entire squadron is sent out on a suicide mission . cooper returns but crashes in the village and a red cross unit removes him . moore searches for him , is told at a hospital he is dead , then wanders the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they are reunited . 

it ' s a nice little romance , but hardly more than that . recommended for fans of ms . moore and mr . cooper it ' s a bit unnerving when a studio declines to screen a film for the press before it goes into wide release . that many movies suck is no surprise , but when a studio itself admits as much ahead of time , the process of movie-going becomes a passion play of sorts . consider it an early christmas gift from hollywood , then , that " aeon flux " isn ' t nearly the affront to taste and decency one might expect , given the above . though ultimately overwhelmed by its flaws , it at least has ( sort of ) an idea with which to toy around . too bad director karyn kusama seems to have little clue how to execute it all . 

it ' s the future . there ' s been a plague . there is a dictatorship , and there are rebels . the latter are known as the monicans , and far from being a cult of beret or tennis racket worshipers , they ' re into attempts to overthrow the former , called the goodchild regime . the regime is occasionally mean to the citizenry , which is more than aeon flux ( charlize theron ) and her pals can stand . through some sort of biochemical virtual reality technology , the monicans receive orders from their dear leader ( frances mcdormand ) , a mystical priestess-type who appears to have been cross-bred with a carrot . it falls to aeon to strap on some form-fitting , futuristic spandex get-ups to carry out the high carrot ' s orders , which are of course some version of " destroy the regime . " having years earlier watched her sister get liquidated by the goodchilds , she needs little convincing . 

not surprisingly , things get complicated . the goodchilds might not be quite what they seem , and aeon herself might have an unexpected history with them . though occasionally muddled , the film ' s central conceit ( of which i won ' t reveal more ) contains some neat notions about the nature of human existence and survival . there ' s room for much more examination of which the film doesn ' t take advantage , but the ideas are there , at least . the big problems of " aeon flux " are technical . kusama has made the baffling decision to film nearly all the action so close that we can rarely follow what ' s going on . to make matters worse , it ' s edited in a flurry of jump cuts that leave us completely lost . the result is some serious spacial disorientation that takes over the film . " aeon flux " ' s aesthetic is one of sleek costume , oddly-angled architecture , and nimble characters . much of the action occurs in minimalist , open spaces that beg for some unbroken long shots that might convey the grace and athleticism implied by the above . instead , we get split seconds of flying limbs , breaking glass , and accompanying sound effects . 

there is a pretty good movie trying to get out of the morass of " aeon flux . " put this stuff in the hands of the wachowski brothers , say , and the results could be quite different . as it is , though , i felt like " aeon flux " was willfully pushing me away from a movie i wanted to enjoy . this film is unattuned to its own strengths . like a novice poker player dealt a royal flush , it somehow finds a way to lose in spite of its potential .  another day - this movie requires you to watch it another day to understand it . i thoroughly enjoy watching shannen doherty and i was quite interesting in seeing how well julian mcmahon and shannen appeared together following the roles they played in charmed . i can certainly praise the acting skills throughout the film , even the directing - but the plot . . . what happened ? i am at a loss for words because i am still confused . i have to stay loyal to the actors who really did a good job considering the madness of the plot . i also have to recommend you watch it because despite the plot-madness i would still watch it over and over again .  perry mason : the case of the glass coffin finds raymond burr defending david copperfield / rick blaine like magician peter scolari from a murder charge involving one of his assistants . a trick involving a suspended glass coffin in midair goes awry and the body of nancy grahn comes a tumbling out . 

nancy was one of six female assistants who work with the act and we learn two things about her . first in a moment of drunken weakness , scolari got seduced by her and she claims she was impregnated . secondly she is living under an assumed name and had a secret from her past . 

billy moses who probably never thought he ' d be doing such rough stuff back in law school gets to tangle with a couple of good old boys when goes seeking the truth in grahn ' s home town . a little more action than usual for ken malansky , he almost gets himself killed . 

one big flaw in this mystery is simple forensics . the medical examiner ' s report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim was killed in such a way that scolari could not possibly have done the deed . the police should have been looking in a different direction for the killer . 

when you see who the killer is you won ' t blame the individual , but you ' ll also see how the investigating officer james mceachin got it wrong from the start . it kind of spoils this particular mason film .  the acting is excellent in this film , with some great actors . it was fun to see fred mcmurray as a young man . this is not a comedy . it ' s a drama and the apparently comedic instances are pitiful . this is not a comedy . it ' s a drama and the apparently comedic instances are pitiful , and some of them appear forced and contrived . it ' s in the script , though , not the fault of the acting . 

the 10 line requirement forces me to write some more . . . hmmm . loved carole lombard ' s my man godfrey , because it is a comedy and , while the acting is wonderful , the story line and the script itself , wins the day . carole lombard is pretty and a wonderful actress . i will try to watch fred mcmurray ' s features .  an awful travesty of the greek resistance . senorita cruz badly miscast as a cephalonian greek girl ( there are plenty of attractive good english Âspeaking greek actresses so why pick a spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an english actor as her father , supposedly a greek doctor ! ? many of the supporting cast are well known actors and actresses from greek theatre and tv series . the only foreign actor , to my knowledge , who has successfully portrayed a greek was anthony quinn ( as the macedonian lignite miner zorba in zorba the greek , as the plutocratic shipowner in the greek tycoon , and as a greek colonel in the guns of navarone . 

there is some historical truth reflected in the film . people who remember the italian occupation of the ionian islands agree that the italians were not harsh , unlike the germans who succeeded them . also mussolini ' s forces , as hinted in the movie , had been defeated by the greek army in the albanian campaign . after the germans intervened in the balkans they allowed the italian military to occupy certain parts of greece , so the refusal of the local government to surrender to italian forces , rather than to the germans . as portrayed in the film is quite plausible , although i am not certain this actually happened .  screen treatment of the comedic broadway success " the gay divorce " ( a title which was considered too scandalous for american moviegoers , though it was used in the u . k . ) concerns a man and woman ( fred astaire and ginger rogers ) meeting under embarrassing circumstances while she ' s in the process of divorcing her spouse ; they dance , argue , make up , dance , argue some more and dance some more . betty grable is very appealing in a brief bit ( singing and dancing in the number " let ' s k-nock k-nees " with overtly sissified edward everett horton ) , but the star-couple looks distressed and unhappy throughout . the surroundings are screwball-sophisticated yet the characters are not more than one-dimensional . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  the movie starts out a bit interested with the son interested in a teenage girl his own age . clayburgh ' s timid-appearing husband is killed in car crash as she is getting ready to go to rome and sing as a diva . matthew objects but comes along . he connects with the young girl again but this time , matt is on cocaine . his superb voice , lovely , impetuous mother is in the limelight . she doesn ' t know how to handle matt ' s addiction . the movie drags on in search of a plot . clayburgh is in the wrong role and bertolucci may have had his head in the moon while directing the picture . the moon has great symbolism . 

save your time . i am perhaps overly generous with 4 * .  the film is a gross misrepresentation of orthodox lifestyle and practice . never will a jewish court enforce a divorce between childless couples . although the concept exists in jewish law , the conditions are too numerous for it to actually ever take place . childless couples do find it difficult to cope with their childlessness in a community where children are a very important part of life , but nowhere are they " rejected " by their community as depicted in the film . they are treated with extreme sensitivity . in fact , many great rabbis have lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce . 

the depiction of yosef , a horrible human being , is meant to - perhaps subconsciously - show the behavior of a typical orthodox male . in reality , it is as typical as a violent drunkard rapist is typical of secular society . both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable . 

it is surprising that so many people form their opinions about a society based on a movie ( by someone who is personally biased against a community ) . i have always thought that it is only the orthodox , because of their narrow-mindedness and insular lifestyle , who judge all secular people based on the violence and immoral conduct they read about in newspapers or see in the movies .  in comparison to other " sand and sandal " fare , the egyptian leaves much to be desired . the film is very loosely based upon mika waltari ' s well researched novel , which centers around the egyptian physician sinhue ' s adventures at the court of akhnaton as well as his travels throughout canaan , minoan crete and africa . unfortunately , due to the moral strictures of the time , much of sinhue ' s story ( which is rife with romantic and sexual exploits ) remains on the cutting room floor and instead , the audience is treated to reels and reels of victor mature ' s wooden acting . even gene tierney Â a leading lady " staple " of the time Â can not manage to look nor act her best in this flick and gives a rather somnambulistic performance which can only be justified by the fact that the actress was having some serious psychiatric problems at the time . there is a great deal of rhetoric and theological machinations over the idea of monotheism vs . polytheism , but michael wilding is so tiring as the revolutionary akhnaton , that one is surely cheering for someone to off him and restore the old religion before the second reel . my advice : buy the book from e-bay , rent something more entertaining like solomon and sheba and then call it a night !  following the world war ii japanese attack on u . s . forces at pearl harbor , " the eastside kids " : leo gorcey ( as muggs ) , bobby jordan ( as danny connors ) , huntz hall ( as glimpy ) , david gorcey ( as peewee ) , ernest morrison ( as scruno ) , and bobby stone ( as skinny ) want to serve their country . but , both the u . s . army and navy reject them as too young . still wanting to " knock off about a million japs " , the " boys " attack an asian clerk , who turns out to be chinese . the unfortunate incident does , however , lead the gang to help uncover some really nasty japanese and german people . 

if " too young " is defined as " under twenty-one " , only mr . jordan and mr . stone would be rejected for military service . but , it ' s possible recruiters were turned off by the office manners displayed by mr . gorcey and mr . hall . " let ' s get tough ! " was made during what the script accurately describes as " open season on japs " - for this and other reasons , it hasn ' t aged well . it ' s a wasted effort , but the regulars performs ably , with tom brown moving the storyline along , as jordan ' s spy brother . 

 * * * let ' s get tough ! ( 5 / 29 / 42 ) wallace fox ~ leo gorcey , bobby jordan , tom brown this could have been a breakout role for valeria golino but the film instead decided to shift its attention to another area . the film is about a woman named grazia ( golino ) who is married to a fisherman and the mother of three . she is a free spirit and prone to outbursts so the rest of the village and her family decide she should be sent to milan and see a doctor . the story takes place on the island of lampedusa off of sicily and it shows the everyday life there with the teenage boys in rivaling gangs and just trying to find something to do on the sun baked rock . grazia ' s oldest son pasquale ( francesco casisa ) adores her and is always trying to protect her during her bouts of depression . the daughter marinella ( veronica d ' agostino ) is a blossoming young girl who becomes infatuated with a local policeman and the youngest son filippo ( filippo pucillo ) is very sassy and mocks the policeman ' s accent . upon learning that she is to be sent to milan , grazia runs away and pasquale helps her by hiding her in a cave while everyone searches for her . this film could have really made more of an impact if it could have concentrated its focus to grazia . we do see some outbursts and irrational behavior on her part but their is no follow up to these scenes . nothing comes of it . the film looks great and is beautifully photographed so give director emanuele crialese credit for that but the story needed to focus on something more substantial . the film does a good job of showing us what life is like on this island and what is going on in the lives of the three children as they grow up . their is some speculation that golino ' s character gives a hint of being a mermaid like creature and that is why she is having difficulty existing on land . i also sense that the island itself expects its inhabitants to behave in a certain manner and if you don ' t then you can be subjected to the harsh realities of its rules . all speculations but i do think the films attention could have stayed with the character of grazia . after she hides in the cave she really has nothing to do . in a sense , the character becomes stagnant . i wish golino had more to do because i ' ve always liked her and whenever she is onscreen you just can ' t take your eyes off her . she ' s a bundle of fury , passion and raw energy ! what a shame crialese didn ' t write a more complete role for her to act in . when the film ends your left feeling empty from an incomplete story .  this film revival right march in a bad film industry and saudi arabia , i want to know how the director was able to stand in front of people of the industry after he making this film , work was so very bad , we do not know how cinema saudi companies such as rutana and other does not support yang filmmakers in ksa like uae we hope in the future to prosper film industry in saudi arabia but without such intervention fools traders and idiots make us bad movies do not benefit the reputation of cinema in saudi arabia is like the roman and iranian cinema at the same time , please makers simple experimental cinema in saudi arabia such as abdullah alayaf and others to achieve the dream of a good film industry to participate in festivals world away from the major companies interventions stupid unforgiven is clint eastwoods last tribute to the once great west . but whilst i thought this was going to be good and raise the bar for future westerns to come i was sadly mistaken . unforgiven , though simple in plot it falls flat on characters and emotions and i would certainly say that unforgiven is eastwoods worst film to date . eastwoods himself seems too old to play the part of acting and directing which also adds a downfall to the overall look of the film . 

all the characters seem rushed and ragged around the edges especially eastwoods character . the acting doesn ' t seem to flow and contribute to what the characters are feeling . the direction is poorly misled by quirky shots . so overall unforgiven is not eastwoods best and by far one of the worst westerns around .  i saw this film when it first came out and hated it . i just saw it again 27 years later . i actually liked some of it . . . although robin williams was totally wrong for the role . . . what i remember most about hating the film is that it was almost the complete opposite of what i had understood when i read the book . since i haven ' t re-read it , i can only give you my impressions from the past - but i am sure of one thing - the film is a paean to family life , whereas in the book , almost all traditional institutions - including , and perhaps especially , marriage - are shown to be strait-jackets that we would be well rid of . the only positive in the book is the wondrous nature of children . . . something that only the very beginning and ending of the film really captures ( with that incredibly gorgeous baby floating in the air . too bad williams doesn ' t have a tenth of his charm ! ) my low mark is therefore from the fact that the film misrepresents the book . as a film on its own it fares better - but only for a few key performances . mary beth hurt is wonderful - i think anyone watching it would fall in love with her . and john lithgow as an ex football player who has had a sex-change operation is fantastic . . . he never once camped it up or made the character anything but commendable - and as such his performance had an incredibly integrity . i watched him closely during all of his scenes , and never once was he anything except womanly . nothing in his performance ever came near the performance of a drag queen . . . and that made all the difference . in fact , of all the people in the film , his is the only one which is irreproachable . it is worth seeing this film only for his performance .  lucille ball cannot sing or act or dance . this makes the quality of her performance in mame all the more dreadful . she ' s not allowed to do the low-brow slapstick that made her a hit on tv so she has to rely on building a character . unfortunately , ms . ball never learned that skill as none of the tender moments have any warmth . how does she really feel about patrick or beau ? we never really believe the words she says . that vacant stare of ms . ball is suppose to convince us she is emoting but there is no chemistry between her and bruce davidson , robert preston or bea arthur at all . for this reason every scene she ' s in is flat . 

moreover , when ms . ball opens her mouth to sing we are immediately made aware of the reason why the studios dubbed her voice for every other musical she starred in earlier in her career . it was stated that she demanded her voice be used so this is a mistake of ego as well as leadership . it is made worse when she is singing in voice-over and she has to " act the moment " without words . whoever thought that would work forgot who was playing mame . 

i understand that rosalind russell did the role on stage and in the film auntie mame . also , i am aware that angela lansbury won a tony for her performance in the original 1966 broadway musical . neither of these women were known for their singing voices , but both could have pulled this off better than lucille ball . why they went with her is the worst in blatant miscasting . 

the only person that gets out unscathed is bea arthur . she ' s big and wonderful , catty and common in all the right amounts . unfortunately , you keep waiting for this movie to take off and invite you to join in on the fun . but the film never does and you can ' t . no one besides bea arthur appears to be having any fun . 

an additional bad review goes to director gene saks . saks is known as an award-winning director of musicals and comedies for stage and screen , including the broadway musical this film is based on . none of that skill and expertise is of aid here . the poor editing and storytelling quailty in this movie is beneath a director of his caliber . that glaring error in the execution of the movie is not the fault of ms . ball .  i had always eyed italian horror maestro dario argento ' s efforts as producer with a certain suspicion and these were only confirmed after my fairly recent viewing of lamberto bava ' s terrible demons ( 1985 ) ; the fact that this was supposed to be its third installment did not sound promising at all but i decided to give the film a rental regardless now that we ' re in full halloween swing . i checked out the theatrical trailer on the anchor bay dvd prior to viewing the main feature Â the undeniably striking visuals had me intrigued to be sure but , then , the film proper ( which makes no more sense than what ' s presented in that frenzied two-minute montage and , in retrospect , can be seen to have wisely compiled most of its highlights ) proved a definite let-down ! 

opening promisingly enough with a medieval prologue straight out of alexander nevsky ( 1938 ) , it goes downhill fast because it relies too much on surreal imagery at the expense of narrative . consequently , several characters randomly take center-stage throughout Â with the insufferable male lead succumbing to the dark forces early on , the sinister-looking bishop ( feodor chaliapin ) resulting a mere red herring , the mysterious black priest gradually assuming heroic qualities , the leading lady is for whatever reason preyed upon by a goat-shaped demon ( culminating in a sexual rite conducted in front of the other cultists lifted all-too-obviously from rosemary ' s baby [1968] ) and a reasonably impressive 13-year old asia argento as the rebellious but likable sacristan ' s daughter ( who emerges as the only survivor by the end ) . incidentally , the older argento also co-wrote the film ' s story and screenplay along with director soavi and ( under a pseudonym after they apparently fell out with dario in the early stages of production ) original helmer lamberto bava and prolific genre scribe dardano sacchetti ( whom i met at the 61st venice film festival in 2004 ) . 

the extremely muddled second half of the film , then , sees a group of people Â including the inevitable teenagers but also a doddering english couple ( whose constant bickering is given an amusingly nasty punchline ) Â similarly shut inside a building in the grip of evil spirits ( the church being the burial ground of a satanic cult ) not that this horror outing is likely to dispel memories of luis bunuel ' s sublimely surreal the exterminating angel ( 1962 ) you see ! in the end , the film is all the more disappointing ( though sergio stivaletti ' s gruesome effects , at least , are notable ) given that i had thoroughly enjoyed the only other soavi title i ' d watched Â cemetery man ( 1994 ) , which i own via the r2 se dvd . that said , i ' d still like to catch his debut feature Â stage fright ( 1987 ) Â and the director ' s follow-up effort to the church , entitled the sect ( 1991 ) . . .  i was talked into seeing this by a girlfriend . . john was a good guy , sweet , sensitive and looks great with no shirt on ! ! i thought it was a love story about both of them but it was mainly about his reactions to her letters . savannah was a likable character at the start of the movie but once she dumped him i lost respect for her . she said it tore her apart being away from him and it was hard - he was the one a million miles away , he was killing people and the only contact he got was through her letters ! ! ! she didn ' t have it hard , she had family & money and he had a tour of duty ! ! i was so frustrated at the ending when he forgave her - he was too much of a sweetheart . i would have waited the 3 years and welcomed him home with open arms .  why is it that instant noodles aren ' t instant , this was the perplexing problem i placed in the lap of the one legged angry sherpa ; he angrily retorted that noodles weren ' t his bag , equally i replied " what bag ? " he looked further perplexed . 

some of you will be wondering , why has the sherpa only one lower appendage . 

the sherpa , who we shall call sherpa 5 , for data protection reasons , injured his toe . " how ! ? ! " i hear you ask , i will proceed , as we have learnt from the review of donkey punch ( 2002 ) irene via sly nudges and dirty winks etc tried in vain to teach the slight peculiarities of checkers to all the angry sherpas . sherpa 5 who is known only for his violent tirades against democratic principals during the post revolutionary years of the now united states of america and it ' s consequential affect on the mind sets of it ' s population in the post modern empire that now exists , through the invasions of countries smaller than it , got carried away in a river of violence due to his lack of comprehension of checkers . according to an eye witness , he sprung around like a feckless banjo string at mardi gras wielding a stick with nail through it , after the struggle that ensued 5 llamas were each found to be missing their left testicles , 3 sherpas were discovered spooning beneath a gooseberry bush and sherpa 5 had the nail stuck in his big toe . 

a sherpas lifestyle is as modest as a nuns , with only rudimentary health care facilities at 15000 ft above sea level . consequentially when the first aid hut was opened only an iou for a tin of spam , and some crotchless knickers were found . sherpa 5 hopped around like a dark on a noose in agony , until irene burst forth like a cock from a hen house and suggested soaked his ailment in llama spit . sherpa 5 agreed to the procedure , to sedate him , a bottle of 100 yr old glenfiditch was produced , some say it was left by an angry scotsman , who is thought to be an ancestor of the angry sherpas . one under the influence , the toe was bathed until ridged , dressed with irenes slightly soiled diaphragm and some blue tack . some of you may feel that this procedure wouldn ' t do the sherpa any good and you would be fully vindicated for holding that view . only four days later gangrene set it and a week later the leg was removed through the use of even tighter elastic bands an odd , willfully skewed biopic of dyan thomas in which we hear little more than a dozen lines of his poetry . instead we have to endure a raw character exposÃ©e seen through the prism of his proto-bigamous relationship with wife ( sienna miller ) and childhood love ( keira knightley ) . matthew rhys plays thomas with sufficient charm to inoculate us against his otherwise repellent self-interest and cillian murphy makes up the persistently tense lovetet . 

the film never seems to decide on where it ' s going . there ' s no arc so much as a viaduct from one end of the war to the other . maybury seems much more interested in his two female leads ( who wouldn ' t ! ? ) than in the man who brings them together and then divides them . miller is the choice of the two ( i found knightley competent at best but then i have never found her sympathetic ) but they both offer dreadfully inconsistent welsh accents . other funny decisions include too much for the inconsequential character of william ( murphy ) , arty production ( eg double crossfades ) that is neither impressionist nor symbolic and the old chestnut act of period footage which doesn ' t blend . 4 / 10 adored by fans for his unusually charming creativity and by hollywood for his softball , user-friendly movie-making techniques , tim burton tipped the scales too far in formula ' s favor with his new upset of a cinematic legend , sleepy hollow . following the quest of ichabod crane Â played by johnny depp , delivering this dreary film ' s only shining point Â to the heart of the mystery surrounding a town ' s seemingly random and gruesome murders by a fabled headless horseman , the story plays out as if it were purposely trying to be repugnantly predictable . contrived as a children ' s bedtime story , humdrum character introduction is laced with intended-upon exciting non-engaging chase scenes which , with undeveloped characters fleeing for their lives , produce about as much fright and thrill as the nightmare before christmas . 

toss in an endless bundle of old trees for ambience and a wide-eyed , big-busted blonde love interest ( christina reechi ) and burton has himself a movie that takes the age-old legend of sleepy hollow and succeeded in making it like a disney movie without the charm or captivation . dialog was choppy and ridiculous , severed heads were aplenty , and there were enough plot-revealing monologues to embarrass the likes of james bond . even with the backing of emmanuel lubezki , the most sought-after cinematographer in hollywood today , the wonderful acting of depp and burton ' s astounding name-recognition , sleepy hollow is nothing to lose your head over .  the cast of " all that " returns for good humor in the " good burger " a place similar to an old fashioned fast food restaurant . the comedy is terrific , the fun is non-stop , and though clichÃ© , is a passer for kid and family comedy . 

a movie for all ages , this movie is meant to enjoy , laugh , and pretty much a lazy movie for a rainy day , as that ' s what i ' d save this movie for , a rainy day . usa aired it today , and since i know that the cast of " all that " is in it , i thought that it might be a bit of a chuckle burner , but in good fun , as keenan thompson and kel mitchell ( probably one of the best young duos of that time ) were terrific together , the pieces came together , and everything worked out , and it made it into good family fun together with some lazy day work to get off the bad day . 

may i take your order ?  of course i have disappeared into the movies . the neil young concert film ' heart of gold . ' 

there have been many great concert films through the years . the best being martin scorsese ' s ' the last waltz ' which filmed the band ' s last concert at filmore west . a phenomenal concert and a phenomenal film , that is if you love rock and roll and felt as if you had been born into it and were part of the music , and could be in the band if you had a better guitar and someone would show you the chords and that with a few chords and a lyric or two you could change the world . . . as you can guess i felt all five to the bottom of my twenty four year old soul . 

neil young was in ' the last waltz . ' they had to digitally , before digital actually , they had to manually scrape a big hanging cocaine rock that extruded from his nose so in the film there ' s a bright light that is not the star of bethlehem dangling above his lip and below his nostril . . . it ' s a famous bit of rock and roll history . 

but ' the last waltz ' was made when the band and neil and everyone else was in their thirties and ' heart of gold ' was filmed last year when neil is in his sixties and his band looks as if they are in their late nineties and the entire movie could visually be used by the christian right and the dea in the same way that those ohio state patrol films of the perils of drunk driving were used when i was in high school showing dead teenagers hanging through front windows or dangling from trees or bloody in a ditch . 

close your eyes and it is a terrific concert , open them and view dorian grey ' s hidden portrait . case in point , the once ethereally beautiful emmylou harris literally coming out of the darkness to sing with neil and from dark to light appearing to be a ring wraith leapt full borne out of the river in front of rivendale . ghastly , ghostlike , a nose that doesn ' t appear in nature and is not an advertisement for plastic surgery , eyes that make buttons on dolls look lifelike , and the ability to express any emotion , human or not , constrained by unrestrained over indulgence in botox . my mind reeled . . . porcupine . . . peru . . . jack daniels . . . living hard for decades . . . my god . . . sweet emmylou harris who i saw sing for free at fred ' s in boulder , a face a 2000 year dead pharoah would not accept . but the voice , as pure as a thick lipped bottle of boulder beer brewed from the waters of boulder creek and i closed my eyes and smelled ammmmmbbbererrrrrrrrrgerrrrrrrssss ( an homage . . . one must use homage at least once in any film review . . . to fred ' s hamburgers on boulder mall and the steve martin pink panther movie ) . 

it would have been a terrific concert sitting in the dark in ryman auditorium , maybe twenty rows back . but , close up , in close ups , it was a medieval morality play depicting the horrors of indulgence and the consequences of a sinful life . 

the concert theme , emblazoned on the scenery , a prairie wind . . . the last song , massed guitars ( i counted eight ) and i wondered if irony was at play . i don ' t think so . a native american bass player , a lead guitarist who looked and dressed like buffalo bill , a piano player whose face looked like the screamer ' s face in munch ' s the scream , the chick singers ( actually matronly singers , mostly reminding one of the lost youth of senior united flight attendants still plying the friendly skies ) dressed in matching full length distressed denim dresses . . . no it was played straight . 

none of them had seen , i would bet , a mighty wind . 

it will be a great cd , and would be glad to tell tales of hippy dippy boulder when neil was a long haired canadian crooner whose indecipherable lyrics seemed to mirror heartache and loss , feelings as universal then as now . 

but , only in a dark bar .  the girl in lovers ' lane : 3 out of 10 : homoerotic subtext in the movies is a well known phenomenon . plenty of dissertations have come out of film schools about the hidden subtexts in such films as top gun and spartacus . the girl in loverâs lane certainly fits the homoerotic trope . in fact , it is so blatant and over the top even mst3k , whom rarely notes such things in their riffing , simply cannot avoid it . 

the film is about two drifters . one a rich kid ( lowell brown ) running away from home with a hundred dollars and no street smarts , the other is a professional hobo ( brett halsey ) . the hobo saves the kid from a gang of thugs and they end up in a small town consisting of a diner , a pool hall and a whorehouse . our drifter scholar gets a second look from the dinerâs waitress ( joyce meadows as the titular girl in lovers lane ) who clearly is past the age of being choosy and whose only other prospect is creepy jack elam doing a steve buscemi impression . 

on the surface , this seems like a strange film for the mst3k treatment . while the cast are to old for the characters they are playing , the acting is actually pretty good with both brett halsey and jack elam giving solid performances . the story is slight , but hardly the robot vs . aztec mummy material and the production values are cheap back lot , but relatively competent . 

it is the strange batman and his ward homosexual undercurrents that make this film both awful and hilarious . halseyâs over the top objections to the kids attempts to get laid in the whorehouse are hilarious , his inability to commit to the waitress ( or at the least get past first base ) are telling , and the dozens of glances between him and the kid ; a hand on shoulder , the sleeping arrangements , blowing off dates with the girl so he and the kid can shave each other . you donât have to be freud to figure out this undercurrent .  i was expecting " born to kill " to be an exciting , high-tension film noir . instead , it ' s got two good action set-pieces ( one at the beginning and one at the end ) and some marvelously atmospheric cinematography by robert de grasse ( usually a " glamor " cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir ) , but the rest of the film is pretty boring . lawrence tierney goes through his psycho kick but it ' s a strictly by-the-numbers performance , mechanically churning out what the audience expected from him after " dillinger " ( an overrated movie but at least better than this ) . claire trevor ' s character is too stupid and unmotivated to have any audience appeal , and the action ( such as it is ) stays so resolutely inside that damned house in san francisco the film becomes claustrophobic instead of genuinely thrilling . it ' s one of those movies in which the supporting players -- notably elisha cook , jr . ( whose character ' s homoerotic itch for tierney ' s is one of the few subtleties in an otherwise pretty obvious script ) and isabel jewell -- out-act the leads . it also doesn ' t help that , nearly half a century after alfred hitchcock and anthony perkins revolutionized the depiction of psycho killers on the screen in " psycho , " tierney ' s is so gross and obvious he might as well have " psycho " tattooed on his forehead . also , there ' s no indication in the film as it stands as to why the source novel was called " deadlier than the male " -- but perhaps james gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the film . " born to kill " is a real disappointment from robert wise , who already had some quality movies under his belt and would go on to a stellar career .  jim varney ' s first real movie is quite a delight , but don ' t come in expecting to see ernest p . worrel any time soon . i felt the wide array of characters varney depicted were great , but without being said , the rest of the movie should be put into a mulcher or something . a rather odd beginning for a movie icon .  george & mildred - the movie lacks the talents of its tv writer john mortimer who brings the close quarter cut and thrust of george ' s class war with the fourmiles alive . 

the plot is cut from standard spin-off cloth - hit-man / mistaken identity - and has as little tension as there are laughs . the producers should have taken a leaf from rising damp , ( also 1980 ) which was also bought to the big screen after the tv series demise , and kept much of the story in familiar setting . 

yootha joyce died in 1980 but she should not be remembered for this creaking piece of work encumbered as she was by her illness . mildred lacks the sharpness of her tv incarnation ; cutting asides and withering looks largely directed at georges lack of libido . george ' s sputtering incredulity also gets lost in the more expansive sets . this is not to say that they were much to shout about . the budget for this movies looks pathetically small ; a restaurant they go to is clearly a new semi-starched house with some christmas lights adorning the front door . 

for fans of 70 ' s british comedy or those who just want to revisit an old tv companion from their youth this film can add nothing to the experience and they should just stick to the first four tv series out now on dvd .  although normally my preference is not for romantic dramas , seeing this film left me a little short . 

it had promise , the characters and relationships could have been explored much deeper than they did , yet the story seemed not to understand the direction it wanted to take . 

the comparisions and parallels within the story , especially the three generations of women in the family , had a lot of potential , but somehow didn ' t fully extend itself . it could have made the film much easier to relate to and attach to which is the aim of any film about lost-love and life regained . 

imho , i think the film suffered from a lack of direction in the writing , although harry connick jnr and sandra bullock did try desperatly to breath a little life into otherwise flat character outlines . 

it ' s not that this is a bad film , some parts leave you understanding the reasons for various plot developments , its just that this film is underdone , and a little flat overall .  the core message is strong , the cast has given it their best shot , the packaging is excellent , but the screenplay is seriously over-dramatized and every cliche in the book on women ' s suffering in india has been over-used to the max .  if you like bad movies ( and you must to watch this one ) here ' s a good one . not quite as funny as the first , but much lower quality . a must-see for fans of jack frost as well as anyone up for a good laugh at the writing .  this story of ted brice , an american pilot who is the sole survivor of the crash of an allied reconnaissance plane in belgium in january of 1944 , is pretty much of a mess . the title would lead you to think that it is principally a story about the belgian armed resistance groups , but that seems to be just a backdrop to prop up a silly love story between ted and claire , the woman who takes ted in . claire ' s husband henri is a committed resistance member , but it is claire who decides , in henri ' s absence and against his wishes , to give ted refuge . 

crucial plot details don ' t make sense . central to the story is the retrieval of the recorder on the downed plane that contains navigation codes and the positions of targets . but in the opening scene we see belgians looting the plane , resistance members among them . why did they not retrieve the valued items at that time instead of waiting for the nazis to come and guard the plane ? and the whole affair of transferring ted out of the area was conducted using secret instructions and code words when the transaction could have just been a simple exchange . the ponderous music attempts , but fails , to lend some weight to this tepid undertaking . 

the most ludicrous part of the movie is how the love affair develops between ted and claire . at first claire is devoted to nursing ted back from near death and , when ted starts to recover , they become physically involved ( while henri is conveniently away conducting resistance business ) . julie ormond does a passable job as claire , but she effects a french accent that i frequently found impossible to understand . her responses seemed a little weak at times - when informed of the hanging deaths of several town members she reacts as though she had just been told that the local grocery was out of peaches . as ted , bill paxton seems just to be reciting his lines ; his performance is so uninspired that it ' s embarrassing . a true american pilot might evidence such a flat personality , but it does not make for convincing cinema . i did not sense any chemistry between these supposed lovers . 

the most idiotic thing is the way that ted and claire act like lovers on holiday . maybe sexual release from such heavy situations is understandable , but to appear totally oblivious of the gravity of the situation is hard to fathom . at first ted is consigned to an attic room and claire worries about his even coming into the house . but as things develop he not only comes into the house , he dances with claire to loud music , enters the adjoining barn to have a game of baseball with a local boy , and ultimately goes on a car trip with claire to a nearby town . 

the young boy seems to be most committed to his role , but he is undermined by the script . he has an uncanny ability to be at crucial events without being noticed . and when he delivers lines like : 

 " have you ever seen someone get hanged . they look like the ' re dancing , but they can ' t find the floor . " 

you feel that it is the screenwriter talking and not a thirteen year old boy . 

and oh , by the way , there are scenes to show that the nazis are pretty bad guys . 

comparing this film to the brilliant " ashes and diamonds " about the polish resistance , or the equally stellar " lacombe , lucien " about the french resistance , one realizes what a truly dismal affair it is .  the distribution was good , the subject could have been interessant and comic . whereas , he described the wandering of an old non credible communist looking for loving sensations . instead of this , the atmosphere is nor lively nor heavy .  oddly enough , it ' s fred macmurray who plays the more " screwy " part in this screwball comedy . carole lombard shows a fine performance combining lighter moments with and undercurrent of drama and seriousness . 

as usual , fred macmurray remains a mystery to me . the camera is no fan of his , he ' s not that attractive , and he doesn ' t have the style and panache to pull off this very cary grant-like role . 

ralph bellamy is excellent as the kind friend coming back to life through his relationship with lombard ' s character . one can only wonder why her character wouldn ' t want his gentle , reassuring love instead of the almost certain doom of macmurray ' s ineptness . but that ' s hollywood ! 

the picture almost works but misses the mark , primarily due to macmurray ' s performance . it would ' ve been lovely to see grant or even clark gable in his role . lombard and bellamy are largely believable and likable ; macmurray is stiff and makes you want to keep him at arm ' s length .  ken burns ' " baseball " is a decent documentary . . . it presents a clear origin of the game , a great depiction of baseball ' s early years and heroes . there ' s plenty in this movie for any baseball fan . . . that said , the film has several glaring flaws . 

18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span . it ' s clear that burns stretched his film out to fit his " nine inning " concept . it ' s not even a tight 18 hours . . . the pace on every segment is slow , almost morose . . . the music always nostalgic and wistful . isn ' t baseball ever exciting and fun ? why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy ? talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak , yakking about baseball as a metaphor , baseball as americana , the psychology and theology of baseball . . . enough ! this is syrupy , mawkish drivel . billy crystal is here to sell us all the yankee hokum he ' s sold us before . ken burns uses the national anthem as the series ' theme song , and manages to play " take me out to the ballgame " so many times you might vomit . we get it , dude . 

clearly burns is a neo-hollywood faux-liberal , so he spends probably a third of the film on the negro leagues . . . these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being as open-minded as kenny is today . for shame ! he chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that america was segregated in those times ! burns falls head over heels in love with buck o ' neil , a former negro-league player , and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly o ' neil waxes poetic about his playing days . nonsense . . . 

burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down . " baseball " winds up as mushy , gushy , civil-rights propaganda disguised as americana . its clear that burns is not a baseball fan . . . otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering , not weeping and reciting soliloquies . . . are you listening , mr . burns ? there ' s no crying in baseball .  caution spoiler : at the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after it was captured . the impression is that the attack was all for nothing . in reality , taking the bridge at remagen was the last important victory for the western allies . it was the crossing of the rhine that the allies had been trying to achieve for six months . because the remagen bridge was taken , the war ended in just a few weeks . 

the bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured . this was enough time for the americans to send combat engineers and a large protective force to the other side , and they could then start building a series of pontoon bridges . the taking of the bridge was a complete success , and meant the that the end of the war was near , and would not last through the summer . contrary to the cynical nature of the film , the victory was heralded with elation by the troops who did it . they knew how vital the battle was . 

this film has little to do with real history . it was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it was produced .  i have been a huge fan of the original crew of the enterprise since i was eight years old . i watched all the movies and appreciated each one for what they retained from the old series and for further developing the characters ( and the star trek universe , in general ) . even in " the undiscovered country " i thought the aging of the characters was well handled and the story worthy of a theatrical release . however , having said that , " star trek v : the final frontier " is easily the worst of the series featuring the original crew . i agree with many that the camaraderie of kirk , spock and mccoy is well handled , but the overall script , the direction -- by william shatner -- and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode . this is a " buddy movie " and , at times , almost unrecognizable as a star trek movie . the action sequences are not sustained and therefore , build little or no tension . the dialogue is weak though it does provide for a few laughs , both intended and not-intended . the klingon ' s seem thrown in as an afterthought . the whole " sha-ka-ree " concept is just silly and laurence luckinbill , a fine actor in everything else i ' ve ever seen him in , boarders on the absurd in this movie . the scene where sybok conjures up images of spock ' s pain and mccoy ' s pain shatters the image of the characters as we ' ve known them . spock would never be party to such stupidity and mccoy , trying to save his father is full of insipid , redundant dialogue and totally wastes deforest kelley ' s acting abilities . the whole scene is wasted and really shows us nothing new and nothing we want to see from these characters . i understand that shatner didn ' t have the luxury of working with ilm for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight , but that doesn ' t allow for such a bad story . in some respects , i think this story does fit in with the old series , but the movies , including " star trek : the motion picture " are all much better quality than this . it ' s a shame that most of the other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie . the focus on kirk , mccoy and spock is nice , but way over used . the old crew really seems to be out of character . i liked the old klingon general and the sultry romulan in the bar . i liked some of the humor and the idea that spock has a half-brother , but that ' s about it . if this was a tv episode , i ' d be able to accept a lot of the faults . as a movie , this is just bad , uninspired film making . it ' s a shame too , because i want this movie to be good . even if it was the level of " star trek iii " i would be happy , but this movie makes all the other movies in this series seem like works of shakespeare .  ken harrison , a young sculptor in his early thirties , is seriously injured in a road accident . end of story . 

 " end of story " , that is , in the sense of " end of any physical action " . not in the sense of " end of the film " . ken ' s life is saved , but he is paralysed from the neck down . when he discovers that he is unlikely ever to regain the use of his limbs he decides that he wants to die and asks the doctors to end the medical treatment which is keeping him alive . the rest of the film is essentially one long debate about the rights and wrongs of euthanasia and the right to die . 

ken ' s main antagonist in this debate is his doctor , michael emerson . although the case against euthanasia is often presented in religious terms , here it is presented in purely secular ones . if dr emerson has any deep religious convictions , these are never expressed in the film . he believes passionately , however , that death is an enemy against which it is his duty as a doctor to fight ; to allow a patient effectively to take his own life would represent a surrender to that enemy and a dereliction of that duty . ken therefore finds himself in a " catch-22 " situation . he must be able to show that he is sane and rational enough to make the decision to end his life . emerson , however , considers that a wish to die is in itself evidence of insanity and irrationality . ken ' s dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital . 

richard dreyfuss as ken and john cassavetes as dr emerson put across their respective points of view skilfully and with sincerity , but this cannot hide the fact that " whose life is it anyway ? " simply does not work as a film . at one time filmed versions of stage plays were done in a similar way to theatrical productions but by the seventies and eighties this was often seen as unsatisfactory because of the differences between the two media . when plays were filmed , therefore , the general tendency was to " open them up " by filming on location as well as on studio sets , by taking liberties with the playwright ' s text , often making significant changes to the plot and even introducing extra characters . 

i have never seen brian clarke ' s play , but i suspect that this is a story that would work better in the theatre than in the cinema . there is very little physical action ; most of the action consists of lengthy discussions around a hospital bed in which the main character lies paralysed . such a plot does not lend itself to the " opening up " device at all , and the resulting film is very static , dominated by talk at the expense of action . although it is well written and there is some good acting , i am surprised that a film was ever made of such an uncinematic subject . 4 / 10 jack black and kyle gass play fantasy versions of themselves in this comic showcase for their side-band tenacious d , an art-rock outfit with satirical , barbed lyrics . an ex-runaway obsessed with heavy metal and a beachfront-living , pot-smoking slacker who pretends he ' s a rock god meet and form a band ( the birthmarks on both their butt-cheeks form the group ' s moniker ) . opening with a funny prologue which apes a twisted sister video from the ' 80s , " the pick of destiny " is a fairly well-produced movie aimed at older kids ; it occasionally resembles nothing more than a middle-aged variation of " wayne ' s world " , with jokey-stoner interludes and a climactic bout with beelzebub himself , yet black and gass have an enormously comfortable rapport ( they also acted as producers , co-wrote the script and all the music ) . the target audience will obviously go for it , though inspiration is a bit low , particularly in the second-half ( just about the time our heroes impulsively outrun the cops in a student-driver car ) . the music sequences are far more successful than the attempts at movie satire and , for the first thirty minutes or so , jack black ' s manic enthusiasm is infectious . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  after two terrorist attacks in europe , one in london and the other in amsterdam , the prime suspect is the leader al-saleem ( alon aboutboul ) . the cia agent roger ferris ( leonardo dicaprio ) that operates in the middle east is assigned by his superior at langley ed hoffman ( russell crowe ) to keep a " safe house " in amman under surveillance , and he associates to the chief of security in jordan , hani salaam ( mark strong ) . roger does not disclose the whole operation to hani , and it fails due to the intervention of ed . meanwhile roger has feelings for the local nurse aisha ( golshifteh farahani ) and he gets close to her family . when roger plots another scheme to catch al-saleem using the innocent architect omar sadiki ( ali suliman ) as decoy to lure al-saleem , he jeopardizes not only the safety of sadiki , but also aisha that is kidnapped . after the execution of sadiki , roger tries to negotiate the release of aisha with the terrorists and proposes to deliver himself to save the nurse . 

 " body of lies " is a disappointing pyrotechnical tour through europe and middle east despite the names of ridley scott , leonardo dicaprio and russell crowe . the imdb user rating indicates that there are many viewers that like this type of fast paced movie of espionage using high technology , satellites and all sort of lack of respect to the sovereignty of other nations in the name of oil that gives no time for thinking , but that is not my case . it is boring and ridiculous to see the fat russell crowe with a cell phone like a family man while his partner is risking his life in a dangerous operation . the rich character performed by leonardo dicaprio is poorly developed and in my opinion this great actor is miscast as an operative agent in middle east due to his biotype . but the movie never explains his connections with the middle east . the rescue of roger ferris alive is also very stupid and corny . my vote is four . 

title ( brazil ) : " rede de mentiras " ( " network of lies " )  director lesley selander ' s thoroughly routine outdoor yarn " the yellow tomahawk " ( 1954 ) pits the cheyenne against the u . s . cavalry with leathery tough rory calhoun in the middle as the seasoned , buckskin-clad indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety . this united artists western was lensed in color but the tv print that turner classic movies aired was inexplicably in black & white . 

the action opens with adam reed ( rory calhoun of " black spurs " ) eluding several indians and riding up to palaver with his old friend and cheyenne chief , fire knife ( lee van cleef of " the good , the bad , and the ugly " ) , who has killing on his mind . fire knife warns adam that his cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the indians made with the government . on his way to inform stuck-up camp commandant , major ives ( warner anderson of " objective , burma ! " ) , about the impending indian attack , adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake . katherine ' kate ' bolden ( peggy castle of " i , jury " ) is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of indian country without a care in the world . castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes , too , perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western . naturally , major ives dismisses adam ' s warning from fire knife until the commander realizes that somebody has raided his ammunition dump far outside the fort . this is one of the many questions that the richard alan simmons ' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim , 82-minute oater . why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort ? no sooner have they made this discovery than the indians attack , knock out of hero , and leave him as the only survivor . before this attack , a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort . sawyer ( peter graves of " stalag 17 " ) brings in his partner with an arrow in his chest . while adam is getting hot water to help in removing the arrow , the greedy sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and kills his helpless partner . later , we learn that sawyer and his partner had struck gold . the question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal . adam and fire knife have one final pow-wow and fire knife demands that adam hand over major ives or everybody will die . naturally , adam refuses and the indians begin to whittle down the whites . james best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts . noah beery , jr . , plays a aimable mexican scout pursued by a sexy indian damsel appropriately named honey bear ( oscar-winning actress rita moreno of " west side story " ) and robert bray of " lassie " fame is on hand briefly as the ill-fated cavalry officer that kate had planned to marry . 

the biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in kanab , utah , is that the evil cavalry officer ives , who slaughtered indian men , women , and children at the infamous sand creek massacre , has been keeping a secret that he is a native american , too ! ironically , the taut bow that fire knife gives out of friendship to adam at the outset of the hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets . " the yellow tomahawk " concludes on an ambiguous note . the survivors reach another outpost , fort ellis , where adam and ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general , but we never learn the outcome of this meeting . is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question . producer howard w . koch is no relation to " casablanca " scenarist howard koch . ultimately , " the yellow tomahawk " is one of many pro-indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of " broken arrow " ( 1950 ) where the native american is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites . selander , who made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and the 1960s , makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament . calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man , and good looking castle is worth watching for her feminine charms . peter graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of his early roles . actually , lesley selander did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called " war paint " ( 1953 ) with robert stack . incidentally , noah beery jr . and rita moreno both went on to become regulars on " the rockford files " .  alfred hitchcock made this comedy of mis-marriage in 1941 but his heart doesn ' t appear to be in it . carole lombard and robert montgomery are the couple who discover they were never legally married and spend the movie bickering their way back to true love . it doesn ' t have much of a reputation and it is easy to see why . the jokes are familiar from better films but here they don ' t gel . and the leads are uncharismatic . lombard ' s performance is clipped and starchy and it ' s doubly sad to think she was dead only a year later . robert montgomery seems to know he ' s in a sow ' s ear and tries his damnest to make a silk purse out of it without much success . the best performance comes from gene raymond as ' the other man ' , ( he has a lovely drunk scene ) . this is one of the few really bad hitchcock films .  i ' m mike sedlak . i co-wrote the score for this movie . and proud of it . 

and i love all of the comments . some have not gone far enough . 

the movie premiered in san francisco in the summer of 1973 . the theater was packed with friends and family . we all clapped . 

five days latter , it was pulled from all of the screens in the bay area . 

if anyone is interested hearing some of scene by scene details , which might make the movie even more enjoyable , please let me know . 

we could start with the shot where gideon blake throws the toilet plunger to distract one of the evil henchmen guarding the radio transmitter on the deck of bud ' s house . 

or how gideon diffused the bomb in the original version . 

didn ' t help . it still bombed . 

bring it on .  i can pretend no knowledge of cinematography or mr . angelopoulos . but i know greece and i love her people . in july my 14 year old son and i traveled to cappadocia , turkey in search of some remains of the neighborhood where his great grandfather iordanis lived until the great exodus of anatolian greeks in 1923 . reading the summary of the film ( refugees from odessa ) i thought that perhaps i might learn something more about the forced migrations of modern greeks . if i did not have a home in rhodes , had i not been to greece 28 times in as many years , were i not familiar with dozens of islands and cities in greece and if i had never enjoyed the friendship of these ebullient , life-intoxicated people , i might have believed that this lamentation had something to do with modern greece . as a professor at a new jersey state college , let me assure you that i am familiar with the history of the period covered in the film . indeed , my wife ' s uncle was murdered by the communists during the communist grab for power . my mother-in-law lived through the italian invasion and german occupation . . . barely . these characters on the screen speak greek , they listen to greek music but who are they ? no , they are not even vaguely greek . of course they are not people at all but simply allegories . they are that which the artist invents when life does not entirely fit or is inadequate to his perception of how it was or should have been . all represent some aspect of post wwi greece that greater outside forces consigned to a fate they didn ' t deserve . as we joked in the late 70 ' s in america : " the revolution didn ' t happen . " for an ideologue / artist , this is no joke . it ' s in fact grounds to put us through two and a half hours of torment . and it ' s all because the various powers ( eleni ' s soliloquy of " guards " in different colored uniforms ) didn ' t allow the generation after the " aristocrats " of 1919 ( spyros ) to follow the call of peace and freedom ( the music of nikos and his fellow musicians , i . e . , the movement , the cause ) . this dark , surreal revisionism smears the true and heroic efforts of the greek people to sustain their lust for life through the tragedies of the 20th century , to achieve more than any of their balkan neighbors , to have become so politically evolved and globally integrated .  kokoda was inspired by events on the kokoda track during ww2 when australian militia slowed and ultimately stopped a push by 10 , 000 japanese soldiers to move overland and capture port moresby . what they really mean is that the movie is set in this time period but is fiction and everything that happens is just a jumble of standard scenes from other war films . the first hour is just one clichÃ© after another . some of the scenes are simply there to be able to draw us into a feeling that this conflict was horrific beyond compare , when there appears to be little evidence of this . both sides fought hard to control the track and no mercy was shown by either side . both sides suffered from logistic shortages and the terrain was a great leveler in this conflict . as the japanese got closer to port moresby their supply line grew and this ultimately led to their downfall . on the other hand as the australians retreated closer to port moresby their supply line decreased . some of the scenes appear to be straight out of the handbook on standard scenes to include in any war film . the film was misguided and highlighted the youth of the production team . at a time when australia could have done with a great film about one of australia ' s best moments the film kokoda is a shallow disappointment .  i like this movie and have watched my copy twice since acquiring it a few weeks ago . but you have to view it in the right context . 

i haven ' t checked on the dates , but i bet this movie came out after and certainly around the same time as the collier and walt disney popularisations of the vision of spaceflight being promoted by w . von braun . this is reflected in the attempt to seem factually correct and scientific . however , whilst certain ideas are put across ( step boosters , for example ) roughly correctly , other things are hilariously wrong . 

for example , we are told that a rocket ascends to an altitude and then turns ninety degrees to enter space . . . like reaching the top of a flight of stairs and turning onto the landing ! then we are told that by turning in the direction of the earths rotation the total velocity of the ship is increased accordingly . 

this is an hilarious misunderstanding of what really happens . most space launch centres are located as near the equator as possible where the earth and anything on its surface is rotating at roughly a thousand miles per hour , including any rocket departing to space , in an eastward direction ( the same as the rotation of the planet ) . of course , if the ship turned to travel westwards once in space , its speed in relation to the surface of the earth would be greater , but it would add nothing to the actual velocity of the vehicle . decsribed in this movie as " air speed " ! 

similarly , we are told that the travellers only feel free-fall , or " weightlessness " when they reach some thousands of miles from the earth , outside of the planets gravitational field . again , comically incorrect . most crewed spacecraft travel no higher than a couple of hundred miles up , but as long as they ( and , their contents , including crew ) are travelling at an adequate velocity that their momentum in an outward direction balances the pull of gravity inwards , they will orbit in free-fall . of course , travel far enough from earth and even a slow object will coast outside the earths gravity well , but in order to leave earth orbit , outwards ( towards the moon for example ) requires the attainment of " escape velocity " , around twenty one thousand miles per hour . so the vehicle will have already attained " orbital velocity " ( and " weightlessness " ) by definition . 

but the movie has vastly more hilarious stuff than this . someone decided it would be more fun if they missed the moon due to a technical problem , fell asleep for a few days and then woke up to find they had accidentally gone to mars ! the captain then ruminates to the effect that this must have been divine intervention ! at which point , any pretence to being scientific is torn into little pieces like confetti and thrown upon the wind amid the merry dance of an increasingly barmy plot . 

the strength of a film like this in fact is in illustrating " how far we ' ve come " . not least in attitudes to women . the patronising drivel heaped upon the female crew-member is both hilarious and also shocking . to think that such attitudes were so recently " normal " . 

as i said at the start , i find this film very entertaining , as a late night , lights out romp through the romance of travel in outer space , from the perspective of the days before it had actually happened . an antidote to the cold routine of spaceflight as it has now become in the twenty first century . 

i won ' t reveal the ending . it is both brave and shocking for a movie of this vintage and character .  have you ever tried a kind of food that your friend made , and then said to yourself , " wow , that was not a good mix " ? well , that is how i felt after watching this film . 

many viewers will be left highly uncomfortable with this weird mix of crime and very , very corny comedy . its almost like watching mr . rogers play a ruthless gangster , very weird . some things just don ' t mix and this film clearly proves that . 

there are some very good performances here , as dean stockwell , mercedes ruhle , and alec baldwin are all excellent , but that doesn ' t make up for the lack of balance and symmetry in the film . 

jonathan demme has done some excellent work in films such as silence of the lambs and philadelphia , but seems to be out of his element with this one .  when i first saw the trailer for this film , i really wanted to see it . i thought some of the director ' s other works were quite good , but i must say i was disappointed . the plot involves a young woman , who lives with a widowed father and two his two sons . they move into a well-guarded community , yet all is not as it seems ; a sort of twin peaks . the woman begins to see , or not see , things an people . during the first reel , i had a hypothesis , and thought , " this can ' t be the whole reason ? " well , the ending lived up , or better down , and gave us what i felt was a truly weak final act . the sound mixing and quality is excellent . saw it in a thx certified theatre , and was impressed . . by the audio , and only the audio . the picture is missing substance .  meek and mild edward g . robinson ( as wilbert winkle ) decides to quit his bank job and do what he wants , open a " fix-it " repair shop behind his house . mr . robinson is married , but childless ; he has befriended local orphanage resident ted donaldson ( as barry ) . young donaldson is an eager workshop assistant , and sees robinson as a father figure . robinson ' s nagging wife ruth warwick ( as amy ) is unhappy with robinson ' s job choice , and conspires to return matters to her idea of normalcy . their lives are further disrupted when robinson is drafted . 

the war also disrupts what might have been an interesting story , as robinson ' s character struggles against a domineering , unsympathetic wife . possibly , filmmakers are showing how war can save marriages and positively redirect lives . robinson and donaldson are a likable team . robert mitchum has an inauspicious bit part . the ending " trick " played by ms . warwick and donaldson is predictably staged .  some people think of sweden in a negative way : too neat , too clean , too serious , too organized and too northern . a people tortured by their own religious fate and history , sometimes leading to depression and compulsive heavy-handedness . this need not be a problem for a filmmaker , as for example the late bergman has shown us what can be cinematic possible under these conditions . bergman used his identity as a starting point and did not explicitly comment on this identity as such . 

andersson however does the reverse : he comments only on this identity hereby dissecting his people to the bone : in his world sweden is equivalent for hell on earth . but he does not take this any further and for me this is just not art but merely annotation . despite the exceptional amount of time it took to make this filmmaker has serious limitations he clearly cannot step out of . 

compared to his previous movie sÃ¥nger frÃ¥n andra vÃ¥ningen / songs from the second floor , there is also not much progress to be observed . the intention was that this was more accessible , but the difference is minimal and the few scenes that try to please a larger audience aren ' t the best in the movie . the same absurdism and minimalism also still apply , there is the one-shot camera position and the ( lack of ) action in front of this shot . yes , the stills are well done , some of the scenes actually work and the coloring and positioning is amazing . but does that make an interesting movie ? thinking in a negative way , this is cinema taken a step backwards . 

andersson ' s background as a maker of commercials shines through in the elaborate setup , but i find his movies about as empty as those commercials . there is a message about mankind , but it is trivial and without much depth .  the riddle as a concept is an interesting idea , but i ' m afraid is miscast , vinnie if given the hard man role is his element as in lock stock and snatch . in this movie vinnie plays a newspaper sports writer ( greyhounds to be precise ) , who during the course of the movie is easily is beaten up with ease and bundled over a balcony by a man who 10-15 years his senior . i ' m sorry vinnie is tough looks tough and has so to cast him like this is foolish . trying to investigate the double murders of a friend and a drug addict found near the thames . he takes on the role of policeman , whilst the real police are bit part players , interceeding with flashbacks from charles dickens . 

when vinnie is on screen his reputation precedes him he looks tough but does ' nt in this part need act tough , snarling at the camera in parts . if you watch the mean machine , he is perfectly cast , and believable and does a very decent performance . 

getting back to the movie what confuses the matter somewhat is the flashback to charles dickens who is narrating a different story with characters who are also appear in present day , these two stories are it appears unrelated apart from the same actors are used . 

the sound on the movie especially from julie cox is inaudible at times , and not really fleshed out what her role in the movie is short of vinnies love interest , she starts the film as a detecive , but quickly becomes the girlfriend . 

the death of the prostitute is sort of answered but yet / not answered . strip out the charles dickens stuff and you may have a decent movie . 

vinnie , is slowly becoming britans steven segal , stick to the supporting actor role , your ' e quite good at it .  wow , what exciting visual effects . i also loved the costumes and artwork , the circus and ethereal feel to the film was sublime . it just required the need for the viewer to worry about the fate of our protagonist . as she is trapped in her imagination , there is never a sense of peril unlike , say , david lynch ' s films which haunt every time . this also draws attention to which age group this film is aimed at . who would this engage ? 

mirrormask is obviously going to draw comparisons with labyrinth with the teen- angst / fantasy theme , but unfortunately it doesn ' t really come close to delivering the same henson essence . the ill mother theme is never fully explained and certainly not something that you care about while lapping up the eye candy . 

not agonisingly awful a la the cell , nor as engagingly dreamlike as labyrinth - a forgettable but good-looking fantasy .  in this film , there is a loose plot of a man ( bardem ) who wishes to obtain financing for his construction business , and marries a woman he does not love ( the wide-eyed maria de medieros ) in the process . he maintains his passionate relationship with his first and true love , and ultimately gets entangled in his own romantic web . he never gives up his juggling act , until the three main characters come face to face . the film results boring , with lots of free sex ( well , both girls are really good ) , all the reactions in the film are absurd , incoherent and of course , too much stupid . none of the characters are believable , which makes the movie a little annoying . anyway , the acting is surprisingly good for such a bad directed film , which makes it a little interesting , but , if you can , watch another film please !  this experimental silent film , made in switzerland by an independent british film company , is chiefly remembered as paul robeson ' s first film . it ' s very artistic , with shots often seeming meaningless to the story , which is difficult to understand anyway because of the lack of enough inter-titles . from what i gathered , robeson ' s wife , adah , is in an inter-racial love affair with a white man called thorne . it doesn ' t bother the cigar-chomping owner of the bar / hotel where thorne lives ( and she seems to be having a lesbian relationship with a barmaid ) , but an old lady expresses the town ' s point of view in an inter-title : " if i had my way , we wouldn ' t allow negroes in here . " thorne is also called " nigger lover " by someone in the bar . adah tries a reconciliation with pete ( robeson ) , but eventually leaves him . thorne ' s wife , astrid , goes off the deep end , brandishes a knife , cuts thorne ' s arm and cheek , and somehow dies . thorne must have been accused of murder because we learn he was acquitted . as for pete , he gets a letter from the mayor telling him it is best for everyone that he leave town . so the film is more about racism than anything , but in an up note , the owner tells pete " the sad thing is , they think they ' re right . that ' s the way we are . " the meaning of the title is a mystery . it may refer to adah being light-skinned ( a borderline negro ) or to the borderline behavior of of the main characters .  this film is about a party put together by the high school " scary girl . " per the illogic of these sorts of films , she gets permission to hold the party at a house which used to be a crematorium , a dubious place long shut down and locked up . apparently the history of this piece of property is one of those town secrets best left unspoken of among proper folk though the legend does get whispered about among the young . 

why was this crematorium really shut down ? what actually happened there in the past ? 

i like these kill-kill-kill films of a supernatural nature as long as there is something in them not copied from a hundred other films . the highlights of this film are a petty theft " 7-11 " robbery by distracting the clerk with a vivid view , the changing clothes scene by the " good girl " witnessed by her jerk younger brother , the eventual demise of the ugly neighbor who hates the holiday , the spooky mirror scene and the concept of running water being a barrier against the supernatural ; the best part of this film is when the possessed party sponsor dances to bauhaus in front of the fireplace ; that scene rocks .  being a big fan of horror films and always manage to find something good about a picture , but this film just did not hold my interest or attention . this story revolves around a father and his daughter and a girlfriend , since his wife died a few years back . these people encounter a horrible situation in a town they stop off and visit and all the senior citizens in this town gang up against these people and almost kill them . this film reminded me of a film called " children of the corn " because it really involves children who are being presented to satan and are his instruments of terror . there is plenty of chants , mambo jumble and a toy tank that completely destroys an entire family in their station wagon as well as dolls who kill a husband and wife .  chapter one : once upon a time at a table ( 1941 ) 

in which a german nazi and a french dairy farmer talk at a table for 20 minutes ; first in french , then in english . 

chapter two : three years of inglorious basterds in sixteen minutes . . . without tables ( mostly ) 

in which an american lieutenant talks to his newly formed 8 man jewish- american commando unit . there are no tables present . cut to adolf hitler , three years later . he is angry at his men ' s inability to deal with the basterds . hitler does have a table . we return to the basterds in a flashback . again , distinct lack of table-based content . 

chapter three : german night in paris . . . at a table . . . talking

in which a jewish woman who escaped from under the table in chapter one has somehow managed to become the proprietress of a cinema . the jewish woman talks to an actor at a table in a bar . later , the jewish woman , the actor , joseph goebbels and a translator talk at a table in a restaurant . the actor and goebbels talk in german . the translator translates the german into french . the jewish woman replies in french . the translator translates the french into german . goebbels decides to hold a film premiere at the jewish woman ' s cinema . the actor and goebbels leave . the nazi ( who talked with the dairy farmer at a table for twenty minutes back in chapter one ) arrives . he talks with the jewish woman at the table . he leaves . the jewish woman breaks down ; overcome with emotion at having spent so long talking at a table . 

chapter four : operation table talking

in which austin powers sends a british officer to join the basterds and an actress on a mission to talk in german at a table in a tavern . after 21 minutes of talking at a table they all shoot each other . the actress survives but spends the next 5 minutes lying on a table talking . 

chapter five : revenge of the giant table

in which , the basterds decide to continue the operation by talking in italian and suicide bombing the cinema . the nazi takes the actress into a small room where they sit next to a table . a hoe that he found under the table in the tavern fits her so he kills her . then he takes two of the basterds to a big room , where they sit and talk at a table . meanwhile , the cinema burns down , hitler is riddled with bullets and the two basterds blow themselves up for no good reason at all . 

the end the palestinian situation is fertile and as-yet largely fallow soil for film-making . ' divine intervention ' tries hard , and gives us an insightful peek into the almost surreal life of those caught up in the troubles , but the film amounts to little more than a handful of ( admittedly lovely ) visual jokes thrown onto celluloid , while the links between them become increasingly obscure as the film progresses . a missed opportunity to say something more coherent about a very topical issue .  in the mountains of japan , forlorn young artist sessue hayakawa ( as tatsu aka " the dragon painter " ) paints magnificent landscapes . he prays " divinity " will restore his fiancÃ©e , whom he believes was changed into a dragon , 1 , 000 years ago . meanwhile , in tokyo , an forlorn older painter , edward peil ( as kano indara ) laments not having a son to carry on his family line of artists . when mr . peil sees mr . hayakawa ' s paintings , he sees a painter worthy to become his " son and disciple . " hayakawa also falls in love with peil ' s daughter tsuru aoki ( ume-ko ) , believing she ' s the reincarnation of his long lost princess . but , with his love fulfilled , hayakawa loses his ability to paint 

an introduction notes , " ' the dragon painter ' was originally released in 1919 by the haworth pictures , a hollywood-based production company formed the previous year by sessue hayakawa , a japanese-born actor who enjoyed great popularity in the silent period . the film was ninth of twenty-two features produced by haworth , each of which was tailored to hayakawa ' s talents and to his stock company of japanese actors . " fortunately , a print of this film was found , in france , and restored . 

the description , " the dragon painter is a fantasy-allegory of love and creative inspiration that is lost when longing is fulfilled , " is accurate . " with its production , hayakawa intended to provide a different view of japanese culture to american audiences , avoiding the stereotyping , violence , and melodramatic conflict expected in ' oriental ' films of the period . " hayakawa was successful in that part of his goal ; although , this film probably did not and will not appeal to most viewers , and is not the best example of its intent . 

 * * * * the dragon painter ( 9 / 28 / 19 ) william worthington ~ sessue hayakawa , edward peil , tsuru aoki the reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog-eat-dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of weakness because they become a liability . i ' ve got no problem with the human side of gansters ' being portrayed but bugsy steers too far in the direction of soft , comical , men . the film is enjoyable but is only light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who , though exciting , was extremely dangerous and fearsome . 

the acting ' s all good and the direction very solid . the locations and era are very well represented and the themes very interesting . did bugsy really want to kill mussoulini ?  for anyone who cares to know something about the real diane arbus , or who values psychological veracity , this film is abysmal . arbus was a brilliant , talented , restless , and troubled person , but this film depicts her as completely self-involved , and truly bizarre in her taste and judgment . kidman portrays her as wan and vague , whereas she was someone who knocked people over with her charisma . the totally fictional relationship that is central to the film is quite unbelievable , and robert downey is truly annoying in his smirking portrayal of someone who seems to think he ' s superior to the rest of the world simply because of his affliction . the film depicts this encounter as being the source of arbus ' s interest in " freaks , " which is a truly banal explanation for the inspiration behind some of the greatest photographs of the 20th century . the mystery to me is why people of some talent and intelligence chose to be involved with this film in any way .  directors of " the messengers " danny pang and oxide pang are responsible for " the eye " and its sequel and their premiere american picture plays like " the grudge " -lite set in a farmhouse . a family of four move from chicago to a run-down sunflower farm in rural north dakota . almost immediately their teenage daughter jess starts seeing ghosts . of course her parents and the police are skeptical . admittedly the film is well-made and there are two or three effective scares , but relies too much on ' boo ' effect . still the plot is a carbon copy of many ghost stories and the ending is anti-climatic and stupefyingly awful . scares are on the low side too with a tendency toward cgi . overall , " the messengers " is a pretty weak horror film that simply doesn ' t deliver . 4 out of 10 .  let me start by saying how much i love the tv series . the nature of class war was always going to be a subject worthy of poking fun at , but this tv series exploits it better than most . the chemistry between yootha joyce and brian murphy was always electrifying and the writers wrote almost entirely flawless episodes every time . in my opinion , it is the best british sitcom of the mid to late-1970s , surpassing the likes of rising damp , robin ' s nest , are you being served ? and so on . with the on the buses series having finished a few years earlier , george and mildred became the next pride and joy of itv ( or itv 1 as it ' s now known ) , enjoying a four-year run on the channel . 

the movie however is absolutely terrible in almost every respect . the general essence of the tv series has almost entirely been stripped by the writers of this abysmal movie ( who anyone will immediately notice are not the same ones who worked on the series ) . as one commenter has already pointed out , mildred lacks the sharpness she had on the tv series and does not come across as anywhere near as overbearing . 

the plot , instead of focusing on the class war with the fourmiles that was the very foundation of the tv series , actually writes out the fourmiles almost entirely after the first half-hour . the plot , if you can call it that , consists of george and mildred going on holiday to some hotel and getting mixed up with gangsters . first rate talent in the form of stratford johns , kenneth cope , david barry and sue bond are all wasted here . most of these are well past their heyday and all of them look very embarrassed as if they very well know that the only thing worth hanging around for is a paycheck ( which probably won ' t be much ) . 

the jokes and gags in the movie ( if you can call them that ) rely heavily upon traditional british farce , including mistaken identities , embarrassing situations , poorly-timed slapstick , characters losing control of what is happening to them and general confusion . and it all fails miserably . as another commenter has pointed out , it seems as though the writers of this movie have never seen an episode of the tv series and instead crafted out a something resembling a carry on romp . the scene where george is stripped down by sue bond ' s character is particularly out of context . 

a mystery surrounding this movie is the bbfc certification provided - 15 . just why is it rated 15 when all there is to see is harmless , non-vulgar entertainment ? 

not surprisingly the era of sitcom spin-of came to an end not long after this movie was released ( shortly after the sad death of yootha joyce ) . and the company behind this movie , hammer , well known for producing first rate horror movies back in the 1950s to mid 1970s , soon disappeared into total obscurity . 

all in all , the movie is a near total washout . my advice - skip this and stick to the tv series . you won ' t be missing anything , i assure you .  mainly a biography of a lustful doctor , " robert merivel , " ( robert downey ) who has his way in the king ' s palace for the first half of the film and then helps out the downtrodden in the second half , mainly " katharine " ( meg ryan ) . 

the good - fantastic set decoration ( i . e . the lush king ' s palace ) and costuming make this a visual treat . the language is also very tame . ian mckellen and hugh grant provide interesting support . 

the bad - after 50-60 minutes , this movie simply gets too boring . it desperately needed to be given some spark after an hour but it does the opposite : it drags on and on . the script certainly needed some badly-needed " restoration , " shall we say ? the film may look nice but it ' s a long two hours to sit through . . . . . too long .  take the secret agent / james bond craze of the sixties , mix in some concepts from sax rohmer ' s female fu manchu femme fatale and stir in some absurdest twisted revisionism by director franco - you have the man-hating lesbian sumuru , or " the 7 secrets of . . . " - better known as " the girl from rio " in the usa , recalling " that man from rio , " which has nothing to do with this . yes , this does take place in brazil , we must give it that . sumuru , or sumitra as she ' s also referred to , is like an evil version of " modesty blaise , " played here by actress eaton with that familiar coy smile which most of us first became acquainted with in " goldfinger . " there are numerous close-up shots of her staring off camera , slowly opening her mouth , probably while watching something unpleasant ( however , she is doubled in her key lesbian scene ) . she controls an entire army of female warriors , colorfully costumed , and rules a city called femina or something ( just outside rio de janeiro ? ) . these concepts , which previously appeared in " the million eyes of sumuru , " sound terrific , but , despite some intriguing set design & visuals , it follows the same campy atmosphere of , for example , the very dated " some girls do , " which came out around the same time and which also featured a female army . at first glance , the sight of all these armed females , usually lined up in a row , catches one ' s interest , but , after 15 minutes or so , you realize there ' s nothing else there beyond just setting up the visual . 

the plot follows what seems like a secret agent , a male , arriving in brazil with 10 million dollars . he catches the attention of the local crime lord ( sanders , hamming it up as an elderly bond-type villain ) , who sends dark-suited thugs in bowler hats to accost him . this sets everything up for a 3-way conflict between the agent , the crime lord and the mysterious sumuru ( the crime lord wants sumuru ' s secrets ) . sumuru also keeps various prisoners in glass cages - maybe that ' s one of the secrets . this sounds exciting but there are problems which go beyond just a slow pace ; there are many shots which could have used a lot of tightening : one shot of an arriving airplane , for example , stays on the craft as it settles to a near stop , as if this had never been captured on film before . there ' s a similar approach to a typical sunset , as if there ' s something unusual about it . the fight scenes are very substandard , as if the filmmakers had to use the first takes . to add some production value , there ' s a scene of the real rio carnival about midway through . i ' m guessing there were various budget problems , especially evident in the climactic battle , where fake sound effects and smoke cover up a lot of bogus action , such as the lack of even real-looking guns - it calls to mind those times when kids use plastic guns and pretend bullets are being fired , falling over unconvincingly . there are touches of sadism , such as torturing a character to get answers , and female nudity , an early depiction of such after some restrictions were lifted . but , mostly , you ' ll be rolling your eyes . hero : 3 villains : 5 femme fatales : 5 henchmen : 4 fights : 3 stunts / chases : 3 gadgets : 4 auto : 4 locations : 6 pace : 3 overall : 4 1983 was a bumper year for stephen king books making it to the big screen . christine , the dead zone and cujo were all released within a few months of each other . while the dead zone was easily the pick of the bunch , christine and cujo were both pretty bad , and it ' s a close-run thing as to which is the lesser of the two . if pushed for an answer i ' d say cujo - marginally - is the weakest . 

donna trenton ( dee wallace , fresh from success as elliot ' s mom in " e . t - the extra terrestrial " ) is a mother whose marriage to husband vic ( daniel hugh-kelly ) is hanging by a thread . she ' s been having an affair with a local worker , and is now dwelling on whether or not to leave her husband . dragged into the marital heartache is young tad trenton ( danny pintauro ) , son of donna and vic , and a pretty messed-up kid with a chronic phobia of the dark which often leads to severe panic attacks . donna and tad take the family car to a nearby mechanics ' yard for repairs , but as they arrive their car splutters to a halt . things get a heck of a lot worse when they discover that the mechanic , joe camber ( ed lauter ) , isn ' t there ( he has been savagely killed by his pet dog cujo , a gigantic st . bernard which was recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat . ) soon , the dog has them trapped in their car and is trying everything to get inside the vehicle to tear apart these two hapless victims . the weather is swelteringly hot ; not a living soul knows they ' re there ; the car won ' t start ; and the dog seriously wants their blood . . . . . . 

cujo has potential to be a genuinely taut siege thriller , but it never really clicks into gear . i ' ve read the book and it is quite disappointing - certainly for king - so it ' s hardly surprising that the film version amounts to so little . on the printed page , king was at least able to generate a degree of tension , but the film is critically hampered by the fact that a st . bernard simply isn ' t very scary . the " visualness " of the film medium serves as a constant reminder that cujo is a st . bernard . in the book , it was possible to forget this . in the book , cujo sometimes almost seemed to assume the guise of a monster . even with the relatively short running-time of an hour-and-a-half , cujo becomes a tedious and patience-straining experience , occasionally unintentionally funny and certainly never as suspenseful as it would like to be . they ' ve even omitted the book ' s cruelly downbeat ending and replaced it with an " all ' s well that ends well " conclusion so that audiences can go home in a cheerful mood ! ! ! chalk this one down as yet another inferior king adaptation .  this is the type of film that makes you question your past admiration for a particular director before you stop and remind yourself that there are very few people whose body of work doesn ' t contain a few clunkers . 

the casting in lelouch ' s films is of utmost importance because he puts the viewer into such intimacy with the characters . the actors have to bring real screen magic to live up to the intensity . otherwise it is just hollow . 

none of the actors in this film had any of that screen magic , in my opinion . 

jeremy irons and patricia kaas fell far short as the leads . irons is a talented actor but he was wrong for this part . lovable rogue didn ' t suit his strengths . his brand of charm also hit a false note for me here . iron ' s persona is too decadence-tinged to fit into a lelouch love story . 

although i would hesitate to pass up any opportunity to hear an english accent , i also think an american actor would have worked better in this role . so many of the songs that kaas sings are so closely identified with the americanness of the particular lyricist that it seemed kind of discordant to then have jeremy irons playing the love interest -- even though logically it really didn ' t matter . it still screwed up the flow of the movie somehow . at least for me . 

of course , it would have had to have been the right american . i think george clooney would have been great in the part . and he would have brought the screen magic in spades . brad pitt could also have done a really good job delivering his particular combination of charming and edgy . 

i was also very disappointed with patricia kaas . in reading about her , i ' ve learned that she has a hugely successful career as a singer and many fans , so what do i know , but i found her screen presence as a singer very boring . she was actually a much better actress in her speaking scenes than she was a singer in those scenes in which she had to interpret and sell a song . nothing she sang moved me . she was pleasant but bland . 

in contrast , someone like kate hudson , who is not a professional singer and has only voice-coach french still would have handled this part a million times better . not to mention all that stunning french talent out there that could have been tapped into . it was wrenching watching patricia kaas take up screen space when there are so many charismatic french actresses who could have been cast instead . 

the music was so important in this film , it could not really work without the music working . and since kaas delivered so poorly in this respect , the movie never really had a chance . 

lelouch sealed the fate of this movie when he cast patricia kaas . jmo .  for a country that has produced some of the world ' s finest dramatists and has such a rich musical heritage it has always been a source of bewilderment to me why so much of ireland ' s home-grown cinema has been so appalling . perhaps because , by its very nature , those talented in the field of irish cinema have been quick to abandon their native shore for careers in britain or america , ( colin farrell is a recent case in point ) , and that the really successful irish directors that have continued to work in ireland and with irish subjects have made their films with international money and an eye on the international market . i am thinking particularly of jim sheridan and neil jordan who alternate between films with an irish setting and projects filmed abroad . 

 " middletown " , however , is very much an irish film even if two of its principal actors are english . it ' s certainly well-made of its kind and might have bucked the trend that irish films aren ' t really very good ; ( paddy breathnach ' s " i went down " , written by the brilliant young playwright conor mcpherson , is a crucial exception ) . unfortunately this tale of fundamentalism set in a fictitious irish town , presumably in the north of ireland judging by the accents , ( mid-ulster bible-belt , if you ask me ) , and presumably in the recent past , ( the fifties ? the sixties ? ) , is so over-the-top that it really is quite ridiculous . 

nothing in the film rings true and you can ' t help feeling it ' s writer , daragh carville , has been strongly influenced by flannery o ' connor and that the whole thing might have made more sense had it been set in the american bible-belt and not in ireland where even the most extreme protestant fundamentalist was never quite as loony as this . it ' s all meant be to be grim in a grand guignol kind of way and it certainly is , though i was more prone to giggles than frisson ' s at the right reverand matthew macfayden ' s antics . he has the ulster accent off pat and there is nothing wrong with his acting or indeed that of daniel mays as his brother , gerard mcsorley as his father or eva birthistle as mays ' wife but the script is so appallingly derivative that good acting can do nothing to save the film . so rather than a step up the ladder for irish cinema " middletown " is , i ' m afraid , just another nail in its coffin .  a disturbing film , this , climaxing , as it does , with an intensely intimate reunion between a naked man and his young son , but in its confused structure it contains a poetically imagined visual exploration of the innocence of an idealised amnesiac . 

the plot follows two threads , the weaker of which is the gradual revelation of graham / pablo ' s condition . wound through this , though , is a beautiful description of his condition , and his meandering path towards a partial awakening , driven by his affair with irene . 

the affair is the strong thread , while the specifics of the plot are carried by a seemingly tacked on collection of characters : graham ' s best friend , who can reveal the cause of his condition in a clunking flashback , his manipulative boss and his comic book mad scientist psychologist : all of whom have an interest in keeping him lost and dependent . 

the failure of the film lies in the conflict between the two threads . one is visual , meandering and sublime , while the other is structured like an inept thriller , all expository dialogue and unresolved patterns of symbolism . 

nevertheless , i enjoyed novo . it keeps flirting with the abyss of taboo and shying away into something beautiful , as in the quarry , with the double bassist and the two women , when a setup for a scene of cheap pornography becomes a segment of peace and rejuvenation . i still don ' t get the tooth , though . 

odd , clunky and a narrative failure , but with an almost redeeming beauty .  i first saw a poster advertising this film on a street in helsinki , finland in june of 2000 . what caught my attention was the proud proclamation advising all readers that the movie , although itself french , had been " banned in france " . upon returning home to new york , i discovered that one of the " art house " movie theaters in the city was screening the film , and so ( with my finnish fiancee ) decided to see what all the fuss was about . boy , did we ever . 

from the comments read here , and the reviews i knew the movie was violent and sexually explicit . not necessarily offended by either of these two conditions , i went with an open mind to see what had perturbed the sensibilities of our gallic cousins . presumably , as anyone who is reading this will know , the story involves two women who embark on a crime and murder spree in france ( the movie has english subtitles ) . the resemblance to " thelma and louise " however , ends with that ; the sex is unusually graphic ( and in copious supply ) as is the violence ( a lot of stomping to death , and a lot of blood and other organic matter splattering after bullet impact ) . 

on an intellectual level , one could make the case that the film ' s very essence is the relationship of sex and violence ( as manifested by the only sex these women know : one is a small-time prostitute , and the other has earned money from time to time by performing in pornographic films . when they , during their descent into crime and murder , have the upper hand over their sexual situations , they react only with the same violence and brutality that they themselves know and understand . it is important to note , however , that the victims of their rampage are not only creepy men interested in creepy sex , ( of which there are several ) but innocent passersby , a woman at an atm , for example , as well . 

i myself do not really understand why the repeated " porn-movie " shots were all that necessary , ( except to depict the physical contact as cruel , unpassionate and debased ) and the unrelenting gore did get rather tedious after the first few violent spasms . 

it is a coarse and crude movie , but in fairness , it is dealing with coarse and crude people and equally unpleasant circumstances . from one point of view , the lives of the french underclasses is explored , and it ' s pretty grim ; a travelogue for france it definitely is not- perhaps that ' s why the french banned it . 

 this film derives from a long running itv sitcom by the same name . the sitcom lasted for half a decade roughly and brought to our screens rigsby , phillip , alan , mrs jones & vienna . 

then in 1980 the film version hit the cinemas . now when it did , sadly richard beckinsale had passed away & was replaced by only when i laugh actor chris strauli . 

i myself felt this gave the film a different feel . i would have preferred if it wasn ' t shot as richard was a key character . thats like having the porridge film without godber or mackay ! 

the film did have some classics moments definitely but it felt a bit de-ja-vu ! many parts were seen before in the tv series . now if you saw the movie first rather than the series you would get a different feeling about it then the series fan ! 

saying that leonard is definitely on top form and makes the movie , just like in the tv series . the film has recently had a new lease of life on dvd and is usually on terrestrial over a quiet weekend . it is a cracking good film , but for rigsby fans you may feel that youv ' e seen it similarly before . 

saying that though its worth a buying / watching

7 . 8 / 10 i a huge fan of when it comes to doctor who series and still am , but i was very disappointed when i began to watch this new series . 

children under the age of 15 , or even better under the age of 10 will probably will enjoy it the best , and possibly new fans who haven ' t seen any of the original series , but as far as fans of the original series , will find this series missing much of the charm the made the original series so great , it took david tennant to get me to appreciate how much better christoper eccellestion was as a doctor in the 1st season . 

i would only recommend this series for people who haven ' t seen much of the original series , people who are under 15 , and extremely die hard who fans , everyone else will just get a laugh and mumble curse words about russel t . davies screwed up one of our favorite tv shows .  low budget mystery . a shot rattles out of the dark and a woman is seen running from that direction . a young architect jimmy mcmillan ( chick chandler ) discovers a dead body that goes missing . the woman in a hurry , mary ( june clyde ) , is linked to the death scene ; but it is mcmillan that has to try and solve the case to avoid serious suspicion . suspects are six shop owners in the vicinity of the crime scene . all the atmosphere of film-noir ; but not quite the real thing . this flick musters just enough to be a decent low budget mystery / drama and is a nice little escape . other players include : george meeker , michael raffetto , milton wallace and rebel randall .  friz freleng ' s ' snafuperman ' is one of the lesser private snafu shorts . a warning of the importance of studying your field manual , ' snafuperman ' makes it point rather clumsily . the story , in which technical fairy , first class makes snafu into a superhuman in order to help him see the error of his ways , is predictable and unfunny . freleng ' s earlier snafu short ' rumours ' had been bursting with ideas and laughs but here the director is lumbered with a rather boring topic and he struggles to make an entertaining short from it . even at around three minutes long , ' snafuperman ' seems to drag and , unlike the best cartoons in the series , it feels like an instructional film first and entertainment second . though they were knocked out more quickly than the usual warner cartoons , the snafu shorts largely maintained a surprisingly high standard . ' snafuperman ' is a reflection of the sort of quality you ' d more reasonably expect from a less talent bunch of creative minds .  some of the early talkies survived to become classics . 1929 ' s " the squall " is a classic all right , but not in the way it was intended . melodramatic in story and acting , today it seems ludicrous , particularly the casting of myrna loy as nubi , a seductive gypsy . imagine nora charles breaking up a young couple and driving a young man to steal . outrageous ! however , as many people know , when loy first came to hollywood , she did quite a few of these exotic seductress roles . 

based on a play , " the squall " concerns the aforementioned gypsy who in the film is now in hungary ( spain in the play ) running away from her cruel master and inviting herself into the home of the lajos family ( richard tucker and alice joyce ) , basically by appearing at the door . one by one , nubi seduces the men of the family and the farm talking her pidgin english ( " nubi not bad ! nubi do nothing wrong ! " ) and dropping hints about nice presents . the son in the family , paul ( carroll nye ) is engaged to the beautiful irma ( loretta young ) and can ' t wait to marry her . he loses interest when he meets nubi . 

with the exception of the lovely alice joyce , zasu pitts as a woman who lives in the household and the stunningly beautiful loretta young , the acting is uniformly awful . loy is stuck with the hallmarks of her character - bad english , whining and hysteria . with her darkened makeup , peasant getup and curly hair , she is not only beautiful but right out of the 1980s - quite modern , though richard tucker ' s putting the back of his hand on his forehead reminds us we ' re just emerging from the silents . 

robert osborne on tcm commented that this film is one of his secret pleasures . while it is deliciously bad , it ' s not deliciously bad enough to sit through again . it ' s just bad - but a great example of how far we ' ve come and , had someone not picked up on myrna loy ' s sense of humor , how limited her wonderful career might have been .  i have not read " a time to kill " by john grisham , and perhaps that would have helped understand the film better . but perhaps not . i hear this is the most faithful grisham adaption yet , and if that is true , i can see why so many publishers turned down the novel when grisham introduced it as his first work . 

 " a time to kill " is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once . it wants to be a suspenseful crowd-pleasing thriller and , at the same time , a film dedicated to exploring certain social and moral questions . let ' s face it , those two types of films do not go together in hollywood , which is why " dead man walking " had to be made independently . 

the story involves a young lawyer named jake ( matthew mcconaughy ) out to defend a black man named carl ( samuel l . jackson ) from murdering two hillbillies that brutally raped his young daughter . the day before the rapists ' trial , carl hid in a closet in the courthouse and when the rapists were brought through the building , he charged out and shot both of them dead . to help out with the defense , jack accepts the help of a former law student ( sandra bullock ) , who proves that her role in this film was totally unnecessary , and put in the film only for marketing purposes . 

meanwhile , one of the rapist ' s kid brother ( kiefer sutherland ) was angered that a black man killed his brother and decided to act out a revenge . all of this leads to a shooting in front of the courthouse , a kidnapping , a brutal beating , and race riot . i ' ll admit that all of this held my attention greatly throughout the film , in addition to the courtroom scenes . what i later objected to was the film ' s handling of ethical questions and its use of formulas in the plot . 

the main question that the film constantly asks , over and over again , is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury . sure they can , but that doesn ' t mean that the man has to be acquitted in order for the trial to be fair . this film , however , doesn ' t seem to think so . besides that , there several gaping holes in the plot used for conveniences . for example , there is an unknown character called mickey mouse , who is a member of the klan , and , for reasons unknown , is helping the members of the defense team escape from serious dangers of the other members of the klan . after bullock is kidnapped by sutherland and company , and left for dead in the wilderness , this unknown person comes and saves her---and we never find out who he is and why he is helping out the people he should be terrorizing . 

and speaking of the sutherland character ' s reign of terror , it ' s amazing how witless the police and the bullock character are in stopping him throughout the film . there ' s a scene when sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot jake as he comes out , shooting one of the guards instead . now you ' d think since there are dozens of police around , it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper . no such luck . from what we could see , no one seemed to even care that a sniper was still on the loose . even after bullock , was rescued by mickey mouse , she never , ever mentioned who her kidnapper was , nor was it even questioned . why was this ? simple . the sutherland character was needed throughout the film to add continual suspense , although logically , he should have been out of the picture . 

besides bullock ' s character , there another thankless character . he is jake ' s assistant played by oliver platt . there seems to be one reason for his character to be in the movie--to supply a number of one-liners for the audience . in my opinion , one-liners show a major weakness in " serious " films when used . it demonstrates that the filmmakers are not confident that the story and dialogue alone are enough to keep the audience ' s attention , and so use them to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone that they are watching an entertaining film . 

but enough of the film ' s many minor problems . what about the film ' s message here ? it is clear that carl is indeed guilty of murder . we saw how he planned for hours to murder the men who raped his daughter . the lawyers argue that it was temporary insanity , etc that caused him to kill . in desperation , jake asks the jury to close their eyes as he recounts the rape in detail as part of his closing arguement . after describing everything that took place , he adds on one final line . . . " the girl is white " . we then see members of the jury with tears in their eyes . 

in the very next scene , a girl comes out yelling " he ' s free ! he ' s free ! " . wait a minute ! do juries base their verdicts on their emotions or on the facts ? most of all , why weren ' t there any scenes that showed the jury deliberating and what they were really thinking after their emotions worn off . i ' ll tell you why . they couldn ' t show the delibertion because no jury could acquit a man of such a crime , no matter how much the defense ' s closing arguements touched their hearts . what is the message ? that someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to them ? 

this film should have had the courage to say that murder is not ok in this situation , because in reality , there would not be an acquittal . but since dollars were at stake , the filmmakers were more concerned about sparing the audiences ' feelings than they were about presenting a responsible message . if people start killing as a form of revenge , the makers of this film should be held responsible . what a socially irresponsible film this is !  not as bad as some people say . . . this is a unofficial bond movie and a remake of " thunderball " , written by kevin mcclory ( co- producer in " thunderball " ) . well , the cast is very very interesting , maria brandauer is a great bond- villain , kim basinger and barbara carrera are just like the " original " bond- girls , plus rowan atkinson and a truly great edward fox , who looks really refreshing in the " m " role . in fact , the whole movie is refreshing and gives some new impulses . sean connery does it once more confident and charming , except that he looks a little bit too old . but alright , he is the original bond and it was great to see him once more in this role . the locations are also typical- bahamas , france , etc . the only thing that really fails is the music score , the song " never say never again " is o . k . , but the theme song is just missing . all in one , a nice try to make a difference from the comic and silly roger moore movies like " moonraker " . only if there was another story , " thunderball " was a excellent movie and really did not needed a remake a young man , named danny , has run away from home and meets a drifter , named bix , who agrees to tag along with danny and watch out for him . . . and his money . they end up in a small town where they meet carrie - a shy , naive girl working in her father ' s diner . bix starts seeing carrie but he plans on leaving soon ( because he ' s a drifter , see ? he ' s no good ! understand ? ) . meanwhile , the town creep , jesse ( played by a perfectly casted jack elam ) , keeps showing up at the diner and bothering carrie . danny keeps inadvertently picking up whores left and right ( because he ' s loaded with money Â he has almost a hundred dollars ! ) whom bix has to constantly chase away ( there are a lot of ambiguously gay overtones between danny and bix in this flick ) . eventually , bix and danny decide to leave town but trouble is a-brewing , due to jesse the creep . 

my review of the movie itself : a terrible , dated " troubled youth " flick from the ' 50s . 

my review of the mst3k version of the movie : i ' ve got to say that this is one of the best episodes of mst3k ever . the riffing is dead-on , all the time . except for the somewhat downbeat ending , this movie is easy material for joel and the bots , especially danny ' s constant screw-ups that bix has to rescue him from . the host segments are pretty good too , especially the segment with the `train song . ' hopefully , rhino releases this episode to home video one day .  now this is a bad movie if i ' ve ever seen one . in one of film ' s greatest years , 1999 , detroit rock city contends with runaway bride and wild wild west for the bottom spot in a barrel of junkies . the plot is masterful . four scrawny high school youngsters finally have their chance at seeing the hard rock theatrics of kiss forÂthe third year in a row . so when their tickets are toiled by an ultra-religious , chain-smoking mom , the pals scramble themselves in getting to detroit , and i ' m sure you can figure out the rest . 

well , not exactly ; the movie does go to extreme measures in explaining how the four band members ( no , not gene , paul , ace and peter ) go about getting these tickets : losing your virginity in a confessional ; saving a smoked-out bimbo and your mom ' s volvo ( from the soprano ' s steve schirripa , nonetheless ) ; preventing a robbery in the midst of botching one for a 12-year-old ' s debt ; and of course , stripping down to your bare essentials for mc ron jeremy after shuttling a full blender with bourbon-leftovers . sounds funny , doesn ' t it ? perhaps detroit rock city does have a point with all this tomfoolery in how extreme sometimes these fans can go . and we do understand this movie is a comedy ; it is supposed to be filled with slapstick . but does detroit rock city aim to the proper audience ? it is rated r , meaning the only way prepubescent adolescents-the audience as i see it , to which many will eventually hail this one a classic-will voyeur is through illegal terms . 

detroit rock city also fails at giving itself the late-1970 ' s touch . the camera ' s texture quality is way too clear and way too bright , missing the necessary flair from films like this is spinal tap and sid & nancy . this would ' ve allowed audiences to feel `more at home ' with the times . simply costuming kids into pre-90 ' s grunge-wear and settling others into `disco infernos ' does not do the trick . environment does mean something you know ; i doubt detroit looked this glamorous in ' 78 . if there ' s anything positive coming from this movie it ' s the kick-ass soundtrack of hard late-70 to early-80 ' s rock . van halen , ac / dc , you name it , it ' s all here . of course we can ' t forget kiss , the band aptly subjected throughout . 

what the film noticeably fails to manage are questions concerning why the knights of satin ' s service ( it ' s really just kiss ) were so frowned upon by moms around the nation . sure , the loud rock and devilish makeup might be a part of that ; encouragements for youth to explore themselves and have a good time might be fair reasons as well . but , what is kiss saying in the music we hear throughout the film towards this highly rebellious group ? what separates these anthems of `rock[ing] and roll[ing] all night and partying everyday ' from the rest of the music ? most likely , these questions will remain in a music communication class and not in the films that should answer them , simply because it is kiss and they rock and we must do everything in our god-forgiven power to see them . 

1 . 5 / 5 stars the seven collaborations between director joseph " von " sternberg and star marlene dietrich were so distinct in look and tone , and so different from anything else going on at the time , they almost seem to constitute a sub-genre of their own . like any genre , they have their outright masterpieces , as well as their absolute turkeys . time to send blonde venus back to the farm . 

after the seedily seductive hits the blue angel , morocco and shanghai express , in which miss dietrich established her screen image as cabaret-singer-cum-prostitute , someone at paramount decided it was time for marlene to play a mother . there is nothing wrong with that in itself ; as an actress she was up to the part . it ' s just that nothing else about the format has changed . it ' s like the blue angel plus a kid . fair enough , the story of a woman who drags her child along on her sleazy escapades is a sound premise for a tragic drama , but that ' s not the way this is played . dietrich ' s journey is played as some kind of adventure , using her wits and accomplices to stay ahead of the law . this is not some cheeky example of pre-code libertarianism Â it is just bizarrely distasteful . 

although we may be able to accept marlene is a doting mommy , there is absolutely no way we can buy sternberg as a director of warmth and poignancy . in spite of this being one of the handful of pictures for which he also took a writing credit , sternberg simply fails to get the story-arc . the film ' s emotional payoff is supposed to be the eventual reunion of the family , but even at the beginning this is not established as something worth getting back to . as usual sternberg ' s interiors are dressed and shot to look like either brothels or insane asylums . the faradays ' home is actually quite a creepy , dingy environment , and it ' s a wonder little johnny wasn ' t wetting the bed and asking to sleep with the light on . 

but as anyone familiar with them will know , the point of a dietrich / sternberg picture is to make dietrich look fabulous , and in this respect at least blonde venus is a success . marlene is introduced emerging from a forest pool in a bright , shimmering close-up , and even when she is reduced to rags the camera still loves her . the same cannot be said for the rest of the cast , whom sternberg tended to view as mobile pieces of scenery . the normally likable herbert marshall is here reduced to a moody grouch lurking in the shadows . even the suave and lively cary grant becomes just a boring , background blob , and does not seem nearly interesting enough for dietrich to run off with . 

the only standout moments in blonde venus are marlene ' s song and dance routines , especially the renowned hot voodoo number where she parodies her own surreal stage persona by emerging from a gorilla outfit . but even these feel like they have been cut-and-pasted from a different film . sternberg ' s fans may hail it as another masterpiece , as they are wont to do , but for the average punter it is a massive disappointment . audiences of the time did not lap it up as they had her earlier hits , and this heralded the beginning of the end for marlene ' s heyday . a year later there would be a new queen at paramount Â mae west .  when a hardworking entrepreneur is rejected from a prestigious country club , he starts a battle between the members and eventually buys it from ty webb ( chevy chase ) and turns it into a theme park / golf course in which everyone can join . 

this is by no means a good movie , but it is still slightly amusing at times . almost all of the comedy is cheap slapstick and bad jokes except for chevy chase . chevy chase plays one of his greatest roles as ty webb for a second time and plays it great . he is not only the funniest character in the movie , he is the only funny character in the movie . even dan akroyd fails to bring humor to this film which aspires to be a great sequel to a classic comedy but falls to rubble with others shown on comedy central . the movie might have been better if ty webb ( chase ) had a larger role but instead he was reduced to a minor character and the star became jackie mason ( who ? ? ) they should have brought back all of the cast and made a sequel the right way ! this is a perfect example of what not to do when making a sequel to an already great movie . overall , caddyshack ii is humorous but a large mistake . 

i do not recommend this movie .  rita hayworth is just stunning at times and , for me , the only reason to watch this silly film . despite the overdone 1940s lipstick , rita was one of the all-time glamor women of hollywood . in fact , for a couple of years i can ' t imagine anyone that looked better , except maybe elizabeth taylor in her prime . 

anyway , the co-star of the show , gene kelly , does not play his normal likable , at least the kind of guy we all know him from in " singin ' in the rain . " here , kelly ' s " danny mcguire " pouts much of the time . phil silvers , who i loved on tv at " sgt . bilko , " is so stupid in here as " genius " you will just cringe listening to his dumb jokes . . . . and they are stupid . 

the visuals are good with great technicolor , which almost looks terrific . you get to see a lot of pretty women in here , too , not just hayworth . unfortunately , the story isn ' t all that much . it centers around hayworth deciding about a career choice . along the way , we get the normal shabby treatment of marriage and we get an insultingly-dumb ending . all in all , an unmemorable film , except as a showcase for hayworth ' s beauty .  this movie is very violent , yet exciting with original dialog and cool characters . it has one of the most moving stories and is very true to life . the movie start off with action star leo fong as a down and out cop who is approaching the end of his career , when he stumbles on to a big case that involves corruption , black mail and murder . this is where the killings start . from start finish fong delivers in this must see action caper . this movie also co-stars richard roundtree . 

i really enjoyed this film as a child but as i got older i realized that this film is pretty cheesy and not very good . i would not recommend this film and the action is very , very bad .  we don ' t know if darlene loves all three gentleman , certainly they are wary of one another , yet they live together . viewers might surmise that the feelings of rivalry between the gentleman and the feelings of all of them toward darlene might make for an unbearable home life . 

in the eerily beautiful rural brazilian landscape ( emphasized by the frequent use of polarization and the use of kodachrome stock ) , anything might happen , and the alternatives for any one of them . save perhaps ciro , may not be alluring enough to encourage them to change their circumstances . they seem to bear the intolerable because it is familiar-the unknown frightens them into complacency toward a fate which is more challenging than their characters can utilize . thus it crushes them , rather than strengthening them . the web in which they are caught is made of the sanguine filaments which bind us all . perhaps the sadness i felt after watching this movie has to do with it ' s portrayal of the inevitable fading of our youth ' s bright colors in the unforgiving light of time . the three children will enter the world fated to relive their parents lives to one or another degree . well filmed and portrayed , the story is tragic in it ' s essence . walt disney it ain ' t frederick forsyth ' s books are always so intricately plotted , with twists and turns , and usually a great surprise ending . this adaptation had none of that . 

so much of what was great in the book ( the history of monk and the betrayed agents ; the plot to influence the outcome of the russian election ) were completely missing in this adaptation . instead , there ' s this completely new plot about bio-weapons that was a yawner . 

forsyth ' s protagonists always operated in the shadows , forever just slightly beyond the reach of the antagonists . the joys of his books have always been the machinations of carrying out their mission . this film resigned itself to gunfights and car chases early on . 

swayze ' s monk might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying " i am a secret agent " for all the attention that he called to himself during the film . and with all of that attention , the amount of time that it took the bad guys to catch up to him was surprising . 

granted there was some energy to this film , which is why i ' m giving it a " 3 " instead of a " 1 " . it was also great to see some underutilized pros like patrick bergin , ben cross , michael york , and barry morse . 

i hope that someday , someone will once again do justice to a forsyth film adaptation like " day of the jackal " did .  the governess is a moody period piece , the meandering story of a jewish woman who , upon the death of her father , sets out to 1830 ' s scotland , posing as a gentile to get work to support her family in london . 

rosina - or mary , as she calls herself in a none too subtle piece of symbolic writing - is a rudderless child , a socialite with dreams of being an actress . she strikes up an alliance with her employer , and by accident solves a crucial problem in his research with photography . giddy with success , they begin a halting and uncomfortable affair while the eldest son of her paramour falls hopelessly ( and inexplicably ) in love with her . 

and like a child , she fails to understand the consequences of her actions - in the end , betraying those she deceived in order to make a life for herself . 

many claim this is something of a feminist manifesto , but i disagree . whether intended or not , this film only resonates with me if i think of it as a cautionary tale . in the end , rosina ' s greatest disappointment is the truth - that she lied , happened upon a way to help a man she wanted to be both her father and her lover , and in the end contributed nothing but destruction . as such , the end of the film gives me the impression that nothing she did , no one she used , made her happy - and that is exactly as it should be . 

did i need a movie this long and langorous to teach me this lesson ? not at all . on the contrary , had it not been for excellent cinematography , unique score and my hope that she ' d get her come-uppance , i wouldn ' t have stuck with it to the end of the film . 

fans of minnie driver will likely be disappointed by her uneven performance but may wish to see it anyway ; i doubt young female fans of jonathan rhys-meyers will be able to stay awake for the payoff they expect , and i can ' t help thinking this holds too little cultural detail to be of interest , even to photography buffs . the 3 points i award the film are solely for its visual style and score . on the strength of their other work , i assume the actors ' performances are so disappointing because of a poor script and worse directing , but they are , in the end , unremarkable .  this was the next to last film appearance by jill ireland , who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a well-known actress and producer . ireland made quite a few waves in the press when she dropped her then-husband david mccallum in 1967 , beginning her long relationship with charles bronson . it is a great irony that bronson , probably the all-time leader in number of deaths rendered on-screen , had one of the most enduring marriages in film history . 

 ' assassination ' seems to be a movie that was tucked into cannon ' s production schedule for the sake of bronson and ireland . ireland was already suffering from cancer-related illnesses in 1987 and you can almost picture the two actors wanting to do ' just one more , for old times ' sake . ' ' assassination ' is carelessly done as a whole , showing the lack of polish and dwindling funds that would tank cannon by 1990 . but there ' s a kind of nostalgia value in seeing the couple together one last time and the film makes you wonder what exactly helps a relationship to survive in the chaos that is hollywood . 

bronson plays jay killian , a high-ranking secret service agent who is assigned to protect the first lady , lara craig ( ireland ) . the president ' s wife has a reputation for being difficult , bossing service agents around and wanting to do things her own way . that all changes , however , when attempts are made on her life and she must journey with killian by car , train , motorbike , and believe it or not , dune buggy to escape would-be assassins . there is little surprise here , as killian believes the murderers are part of an inside job , perhaps arranged by the president himself . on the way , killian and mrs . craig develop an unspoken affection for one another in scenes between bronson and ireland that are actually very funny . 

what really gets me is how this film was promoted upon its release and how it ' s still made to look as a dvd . the original trailer gives you the feeling that ' assassination ' is another cold-hearted bronson shoot- ' em-up . but a lot of this movie - which was rated pg-13 , by the way - is in a comic vein , putting it along the lines of a romantic thriller like bronson and ireland ' s western ' from noon till three . ' even the dvd case shows bronson with a rocket launcher , ready to blow things up . which he does , but to a lesser degree than his other ' 80s potboilers . 

on the whole , ' assassination ' is late cannon slop work and doesn ' t really know what kind of film it wants to be . besides drifting from actioner to romantic thriller and back again , there are serious mistakes in continuity , property values are bottom-of-the-barrel cheap , and the effects are dreadful ; many of the explosions seem like matte work rather than being done on location . robert ragland , who had shown good composing skills in earlier films , teamed up with valentine mccallum on a score that is mostly synthesized and better fit for television . 

richard sale ' s script has real lulus of dialogue , with the conversations between bronson and ireland the only bright spot . there is no explanation as to why the first lady is called ' one momma ' all of a sudden , nor as to why ireland is left with her british accent when the character is a wyoming native . jan gan boyd , playing killian ' s main assistant , has a kitten-like personality and is badly miscast as a federal agent . stephen elliott ( a former tony award nominee who died in may 2005 ) , randy brooks , erik stern ( as assassin bracken ) , and michael ansara ( senator bunsen ) are acceptable in their supporting roles . 

incidentally , this was the last film directing gig for peter hunt , who broke onto the scene with ' on her majesty ' s secret service ' in 1969 and collaborated with bronson and lee marvin on ' death hunt ' in 1981 . ' assassination ' is available on dvd through mgm home entertainment ; it is presented in dual widescreen and standard format with three-language subtitles and theatrical trailer . 

 * * out of 4 i would bet a month ' s salary " the magnificent seven returns " ( msr ) was made-for-tv . other reviewers attest that msr was a theatrical movie , and i ' ll take their word for it . the logical answer must assume it was originally shot for tv , and after a change-of-studio-heart , it was released theatrically instead . every actor is primarily a tv actor : mariette hartley , michael callen , ralfe waite , stephanie powers . . . tv performers all . lee van cleef split his time between tv and theater screens . stephanie powers has only made 3 or 4 " real " movie appearances in the last thirty years of a very prolific television career - proof positive this was shot for tv . minor players are veteran small-screen actors who can be seen on old reruns of " gunsmoke " , " wild wild west , " " streets of san francisco , " and so on . 

the ho-hum sets are identical to the universal studios tour sets , often seen in old episodic tv . and the editing betrays the one-or-two-takes-hurriedness of tv , with limited camera movements , positioning , cutting , and lighting . the sound track , exclusive of the original berstein themes , are straight from seventies television . yep , i ' d bet money it was shot for tv . 

that ' s an important point in evaluating msr . initially i watched msr on cable assuming it was an old theatrical release . in comparison to the original " magnificent seven " , it ' s a joke , a cartoon , an amateurish attempt at movie making . acting , lighting , writing , settings , action , cinematography , music ( exempting the berstein themes ) , editing , pacing , . . . on and on . . . . all pale in comparison to the classic " magnificent seven " which is close to the perfect 60 ' s western , and one of the great action movies of all time . 

however , viewed as an early 70 ' s made-for-tv movie , as i suspect , the film is actually better than average . those unfortunate enough to live through the 70 ' s as an adult , know what i ' m talking about . msr would have competed against " alias smith and jones " and similarly bland network shows . during the seventies , " gunsmoke " was a quality show , concentrating on character development rather than action , deemphasizing gun play to two shootouts a week . the first shooting , usually a murder , sets the hour ' s plot into motion - the second shootout climaxes the episode by killing the guest star , his nemesis , or otherwise resolving the conflict with marshal matt dillon . msr has more action than a whole season of " gunsmoke . " in this light - in this frame of reference - msr is passable entertainment , a cut above the tv fare from that decade .  after spending half an hour examining rumors , a gay bar located outside tupelo , mississippi , small town gay bar shifts focus to the murder of scotty weaver in bay minette in order to demonstrate the risks run by the interview subjects . but there is a problem here . bay minette isn ' t near tupelo , as the film implies . it isn ' t even in the same state . it is actually about three hundred miles away in coastal alabama . 

director malcom ingram doesn ' t exactly rush to point out this fact , nor does he bother to mention that while bay minette itself is little more than a wide spot in the road , it is actually about two deep breaths away from the major metro area of mobile , alabama--which has a noticeable gay community , quite a few gay bars , and even a congregation of metropolitan community church . if ingram is disingenuous on these points , one has to ask if he is on others as well . 

speaking as someone who was born , raised , and continues to live in mississippi , i have to say that i find most of small town gay bar a lot of hooey . neither meridian nor tupelo , the communities upon which ingram focuses , are as rural , small , or as isolated as he would have you imagine , and gay bars are indeed more common in the state than the film implies . that said , ingram rather blithely ignores the fact that the absence of a gay bar does not mean an absence of a gay community , and in doing so he demonstrates a rather profound ignorance of southern culture , which tends to hold those who frequent bars--be they gay or straight--in low esteem . 

small town gay bar is , in my opinion , an instance in which a film maker came to his subject with a personal agenda in hand and then proceeded to film the agenda . do gays and lesbians living in rural mississippi face major , sometimes frightening challenges ? you bet they do--but that ' s no excuse for fiddling with reality to such a degree . the dvd includes a commentary track and a number of deleted scenes , but i found the feature film itself so ridiculous that i didn ' t waste any time on them . 

gft , amazon reviewer yes pigeon and coburn are great , and it ' s interesting to watch them , although coburn seems rather restrained and dull here . it ' s enjoyable to view seattle , victoria and salt lake city of 1970 ' s , and the period cars and clothing . that ' s all the good in this boring film . the dialog is incredibly bad , as is most of the acting . ray and sandy ' s motivations seem forced and unlikely . i ' ve seen this " training to be a pickpocket " routine several times before . there ' s a long build up , leading to nothing . better to catch an episode of " streets of san francisco " , or one of the many great crime / caper movies . to name a few , there are bedtime story , remade as dirty rotten scoundrels , the lavender hill mob , the grifters , paper moon , the sting , and best of all , house of games .  this could have been a great movie with plenty of educational potential for teachers around the world about evolution , biology , the creative work in science , research and darwin ' s life , but it is not . 

the screenplay is mostly historically inaccurate and transforms a true story into a mexican soup-opera melodrama . while it is true that darwin gradually lost his religious beliefs , this was in great part due to his findings during the voyage of the beagle and not solely due to the loss of his daughter . he was certainly disturbed by his loss , but that did not made him literally insane , delusional and detached from his friends and family . the such portrayal of darwin is an invention of the script writer . thus it cannot be used in any way as place to learn a bit about darwin ' s life and psyche . according to most historians , darwin had the theory ready by the end of the beagle voyage , and kept it from going public because he wanted to develop further the consequences of it and check against more data . in the movie , it is an imaginary conflict of darwin with his religious beliefs and the mental illness that he developed after his daughter ' s death that kept him from going public . 

the movie brings a modern situation , the creationists vs scientists debate , into the life and times of darwin , thus it is anachronistic . it depicts thomas huxley not as a man trying to develop further understanding of biology but as someone eager to " kill god " , in his own words from the movie , and destroy the church , who would accept the theory of evolution for such purposes and not because it was a synthesis of plenty of disconnected data . huxley is presented as a very arrogant and insensible person , a combination that i interpret was an attempt to ridicule active atheists who speak up against religion . in real life , huxley accepted darwin ' s ideas after publication only gradually , and before the work of darwin he thought that there was not enough evidence to support evolution . his first support of evolution was published one month after the origin of species became public . he was agnostic but did not think it was necessary " to kill god " , only thought that there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural . the debate creationists vs scientists appears throughout the movie , and creationists catch-phrases such as " it is only a theory " are part of the discussion . of course , no such dispute or catch-phrases existed at that time . in fact , the anglican church published a positive review of the origin ' s saying that they saw god ' s work in evolution , in some sense , quite in fact in contradiction to the way that the clergy is portrayed in the screenplay . 

another awful aspect of this movie is that it gives the wrong impression to the general public that scientific research is done by a solitary crazy man who just writes a lot . nothing could be further from the truth . the conception of the theory of evolution was the result of thorough observations of living forms by darwin during five years in the hms beagle , and was developed gradually as it can be seen from darwin ' s notes of the voyage . even though the beagle voyage was the sole most important part of darwin ' s life to the conception of " origin of species " , the voyage is briefly mentioned only once at the beginning , and no attempt is made to show that the book came as an elaborate analysis of observations . to make it worse , darwin is shown performing a single experiment ( pigeon breeding ) to test his theory and , in the end , quits it . and i ' m not really sure whether such experiment did actually occur . 

great disappointment . it is not in any way a homage to darwin and science .  gold raiders ( 1951 ) 

a dull western / comedy feature with the three stooges ( including shemp howard at this point , who i ' ve always enjoyed as the " third stooge " ) doing their usual schtick , and directed by the normally dependable edward bernds , who also did some of their funniest classic shorts -- so one has to wonder , just what went wrong this time ? the most probable answer is that what worked pretty good as a 15-minute two-reeler comes up as too much for a 55-minute feature film . unlike so many of their classic short subjects , gold raiders is not worth revisiting . 

 * 1 / 2 of * * * *  when watching this movie , with it ' s deterministic cause and effect , wall-to-wall clichÃ©s and hackneyed sentiment , can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how barrie ' s life played out ? you watch it in a posture of disagreement . hollywood biopics aren ' t based on the individual lives anymore , they ' re just rewrites of previously successful biopics . if hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect synchronization that you ' d barely recognize your own story . any personal complexity would be obliterated by some all-explaining , simplistic backstory . your story would resemble " rocky " because it ' s the only life-arc hollywood knows how to produce anymore . we couldn ' t leave the audience pondering anything left open-ended as they exit . this movie doesn ' t trust an audience to figure things out without being led to them . i perceived the captain hook / mother reference eons before the movie literalized it for me . i could see the 25 kids twist coming for days . 

this is a completely average movie . not horrible but not great . hence it ' s likely to be showered with a few oscars next year . there ' s nothing the academy likes better than congratulating itself for finally noticing patterns put in place over the previous thirty years . 

from the new yorker article " lost boys " by anthony lane : 

 " arthur llewelyn davies , also adored his boys , and it may be unfair of " finding neverland " to omit him , for streamlining purposes , from the scene ; by the time that johnny depp meets kate winslet , she is already a widow , whereas arthur was very much alive when barrie first entered the consciousnessÂand , little by little , the homeÂof the llewellyn davies family . 

 " finding neverland " is a weepie . from the moment that barrie met george and jack , and started to ponder the means by which they might be rendered immortal , the story is sad , but the reality is even more dismal : 1907Âarthur llewellyn davies dies from cancer of the jaw . 1910Âsylvia dies of lung cancer . the five boys are orphaned ; barrie is made their guardian . 1915Âgeorge is killed in the first world war , fighting with his regiment in flanders . 1921Âmichael , an undergraduate at oxford , is drowned while swimming with a friend . the two bodies , when recovered , are found clinging together . 

on april 5 , 1960 , peter llewellyn davies , by then an esteemed publisher , threw himself under a subway train in london . we should not presume to read a mind in torment , but we may note in passing that , if he had lived another month , he would have reached the centenary of barrie ' s birth and thus , one imagines , a fresh flurry of interest in " peter pan " Â " that terrible masterpiece , " in the words of peter llewellyn davies .  this movie should be retitled : sex in the 70s in a part of new york city called greenwich village and chelsea . 

this movie does little to talk about sex in the 70s except focus on the hypersexual environments of public and private sex spaces in new york city . i doubt that the manhole bar was symbolic of actual sex in the 70s and that kind of sex is much more prevalent in the film . 

don ' t get me wrong , the time period looks like a blast . and it ' s rather important to document the scene to which the film refers . but as far as calling this film sex in the 70s , the title is a bit misleading . technically it ' s no oscar nominee , but the rawness of it feels appropriate for the subject . 

overall , an " eh . "  combining serious drama with adequate comedy is touchy at the best of times . looking for comedy in the muslim world pulled it off thanks to a topical subject and a fantastic script ; not to mention albert brooks ' excellent broodish character portrayal . but man of the year can ' t come close by comparison . it has a messy message folded in with forced jokes and a twisted love story that is completely unbelievable . 

the premise initially seemed very promising . put a jon stewart-like comedy news guy up for president of the united states and see what happens . this independent runner is tom dobbs ( robin williams , rv ) , a successful tv personality who is pressured into running by his audience . along with him comes his manager jack ( christopher walken , click ) , and his writer eddie ( lewis black ) . seeming to have very little chance at a successful run , tom dobbs amazingly wins the election . 

but did he ? eleanor green ( laura linney , the exorcist of emily rose ) is a computer whiz at the company who designed the new software for electronic voting at polling stations . she finds a glitch in the system that is quickly swept under the rug by the company ' s owner and his dark attorney alan ( jeff goldblum , independence day ) . poised to lose billions of dollars if word of this gets out , the company ' s evil men decided to discredit and / or kill eleanor to make sure she never tells anyone . but eleanor is able to get to president-elect dobbs and finally spill the beans ( this is where the unbelievable love story starts blossoming , too ) . dobbs goes onto saturday night live and explains everything to the world , thus removing himself as the newly elected president and ending the careers of those at the computer company . . . oh , and saving ms . green ' s life . 

does any of this sound funny ? the comedy is forcefully wedged into the story and is often awkward . robin williams blazes for a few moments during a debate but is quickly doused as the gravity of how he became president bears down on him . 

the message of the film is interesting and debatable , too : that special interest owns presidential candidates . i ' m sure there ' s substantial truth in this , and if you wanted to make a movie about it you could . if you wanted to make a comedy about you could . but man of the year isn ' t it .  the cinemascope color cinematography of leon shamroy is quite remarkable here , including his use of colored filters for

various scenes . the alfred newmann score has to be the most sensual and seductive score hollywood ever produced . it ' s a shame it is no longer available on cd . the actors , however , never rise to the occasion . the accents are so varied , from the subdued british of ustinov and purdom to the hollywood of baxter and mature that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central vision . tommy rettig is jarringly american . acting styles span the range from zombie-like to stilted . only ustinov as a conniving one-eyed servant steals the show - what there is of it to steal . the premise - the story of a young egyptian doctor , seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the cult of the single god , ra - persecuted by the authorities , has its interesting points . but when the film ' s plot fades , it is the haunting music and visuals that remain .  as i write this , norman wisdom is a very confused old man who spends most of his waking hours cackling and yelping old catch-phrases at his increasingly suicidal nurse . 

indeed , by the time you read this he will probably have joined the hereafter and the obituaries will record a near 80 year career of hysterical mirth-making from the lovable funster with the crooked chequered cap . what most of these obituaries won ' t recall is how norman wisdom had already committed a form of suicide back in the late 1960s with this staggeringly poor , yet strangely compelling endpaper to his movie career . 

the signs are ominous from the off Â " tony tenser presents " go the titles . you scratch your head Â " where have i seen that name before . . ? " well , on the titles of a lot of the cheapest , crappiest british films of the 1970s so just take your pick . 

then it says Â " a menahem golan production " . oh dear . 

from what i could make out what follows is a combination of confessions from a holiday camp and last tango in paris . sponsored by the southport tourist board . 

norman wisdom is very versatile at being norman wisdom ( or a variation of such ) here . even in trash like this , he ' s never off form and somehow keeps you watching through parted fingers as he paws and dribbles all over a ( clearly insane ) sally geeson . tony tenser and menahem golan were , between them , responsible for some true cinematic horrors but the bedroom scene in filmic atrocity reborn . sally plays the role of a lobotomised sex toy very well , by the way . 

i wonder if any of the crazy young cats who populate this movie ' s party scenes maybe thought to themselves in a quiet moment " ummÂold norman+sex+hippies . get me outta this mess ! ! " i guess it was a payday for them . 

a do feel sorry for the pretty things though . they probably thought " yeah ! this ' ll do for us what blow up did for the yardbirds " 

and so old norman ' s leading man career ended . freezing his little balls off in southport . 

i went there once . it was a depressing place .  it ' s saturday , it ' s raining , and i think every movie should have at least one comment . . . so i just watched " the crime doctor ' s courage " all the way through . it ' s a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters , and a couple of the usual suspects -- each with their own possible motive for the crime . the story starts abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot with no character development or storytelling whatsoever . i guess that ' s not too surprising for a b movie of this period . there are also some moments which look and feel like this is pre-wwii , but perhaps that is due to the writer ' s background in radio shows . 

the " crime doctor " is the sleuth who happens to be visiting california for some r & r from his psychiatry practice on the east coast . he hooks up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving capers . the novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth ( aka dr . watson ) , and also occasionally lightens things up with a bit of comic relief ( sort of ) . 

there is also a somewhat simple , but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the meddling sleuth . and then there are the mysterious braggas , a brother and sister who are dance artists at a night-club . the dance is sort of an interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments which feels more like the 30 ' s than the 40 ' s . though the story location is california , the braggas appear to live in a castle ! 

there was one plot element which managed to keep me somewhat amused , but i won ' t divulge any more than that because i always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered , rather than known in advance . ( even though i can think of many , many , b films which would rate higher and it is difficult to say that watching this one is time well spent ) i have not seen any other movies from the " crime doctor " series , so i can ' t make any comparisons .  danny is beyond sorry . 

he keeps making the same mistakes , and is no longer interesting to watch . at first i could feel for him , as an addict myself . my heart went out to him at the beginning , and somewhere along the line he went over the line . it is almost as if he is continuing this behavior to keep the show going , and at the same time is seriously risking his life , and the welfare of his family , especially his children . it is difficult even to have pity for the poor boy . i think he needs to watch this show , maybe then he might have a chance a saving this marriage . i can ' t understand how gretchen stays with him , and i keep wondering how much is just for show , and how much is love . danny , get a life - a new one that is ! . . . and don ' t get me started on dr . gary . what is with him and his face ? his skin looks like it ' s stretched to the max . besides that , looks don ' t mean a thing , yet he seems not to be particularly impartial . i think , he too , is keeping this going for his own monetary gain and often not in the best interests of either gretchen or danny . these people are few confused and each remind me of a dog chasing its tail . sad , very sad . c ' mon pull yourselves together .  a remake of a successful movie can be a tricky business at best ; to remake a true classic , especially one that is veritably the definitive film of a director like alfred hitchcock , is something else again . and after watching this version of `psycho , ' directed by gus van sant , two things come to mind immediately : what ' s the point , and what on earth were they thinking ? especially in light of the fact that van sant used the same screenplay ( by joseph stefano , taken from the novel by robert bloch ) that hitchcock used . the final result here underscores some of the finer points of the art of filmmaking : first , that a `remake ' should be just that ; a retooling of the original , rather than a `copy ' using new players ; and second , that shooting in color , using more blood and being a bit more graphic does little more than detract from the impact of the film . although this was a noble effort by van sant , ironically in the end it suffers from the same flaw with which norma bates was afflicted : the `mind ' of the film was divided ; half was hitchcock , half van sant . and the twain , though met , shall never be bound . van sant , even working from the original script , would have been better off making his own film-- all the way through-- rather than attempting to duplicate exactly what hitchcock did with certain scenes . the opening shot of the movie , for instance , and especially the `shower ' scene , arguably one of the most famous scenes in the history of the cinema . copying hitchcock , from the shots looking directly into the shower head to the one of the drain , and using the same `skree ! skree ! skree ! ' sound effects-- even as homage to hitchcock-- again , only distracted from the story . and , if you factor in the performance of william h . macy ( as private eye arbogast ) , you have yet another split in the psyche of the film . macy is a terrific actor-- one of the best character actors in the business-- and his performance here is excellent ; but as good as it is , the attitude and delivery are pure david mamet ( with whom he has worked many times ) , and seemingly out of context with what van sant is doing . so the film winds up with a triple personality disorder : hitchcock , van sant and mamet . i felt like i was watching `house of good will psycho games . ' 

	as far as performances go , macy ' s was as solid as they come , and anne heche ( marion crane ) did a good job of creating an original character , escaping the trap of attempting an imitation of janet leigh . the weak links were viggo mortensen ( sam ) , who made marion ' s boyfriend so smarmy and unappealing it made you wonder why she had anything to do with him in the first place ; and vince vaughn , who--to put it as delicately as possible-- was simply awful as norman bates . his whole performance was that of an actor playing a role ( and not very convincingly at that ) ; affecting effeminate mannerisms and punctuating his speech with `spontaneous ' bursts of maniacal laughter made his norman more of a caricature than a character , altogether unbelievable and pretentious . it gave the movie the feel of a reenactment of a `true incident ' you would see on a television show ; it would have been entirely in keeping with the sensibility of the film to cut away from norman sitting alone in his parlor to a shot of a sober-faced peter graves , intoning , `such was the mind-set of norman bates on that fateful , rainy night when marion crane stepped out of her car and into his life-- ' the supporting cast includes julianne moore ( lila ) , robert forster ( dr . simon ) , philip baker hall ( sheriff al chambers ) , anne haney ( mrs . chambers ) , chad everett ( tom cassidy ) , rance howard ( mr . lowery ) , rita wilson ( caroline ) , james remar ( patrolman ) and james legros ( charlie the car dealer ) . if nothing else , van sant ' s `psycho ' is a curiosity that goes to show that having a good director , a predominantly excellent cast and a script that is a proven commodity does not necessarily insure a success . granted , todays era of psycho-babble , `american psycho ' and hannibal lecter have effectively taken the edge off of a character like norman bates somewhat ; but there is still a singular intimacy in this particular story of the relationship between norman , his mother and his victims that will forever remain inherently disturbing and terrifying ; but van sant is unable to convey that sense of dread , that throat-clenching fear , with this film . if ever there was a movie made that should have been earmarked straight-to-video , this is it . better still , had it never been born . i rate this one 2 / 10 this film is about a young man ' s painful journey to discovering his sexuality . 

the film is raw and unpretentious . it does not rely on steamy sex scenes to attract the viewers . though the plot may seem incoherent and disconnected at times , and some events are not properly explained . i can understand it though , because this film is a collection of memories that are highly personal to the director . the subplot of about his sister and mother probably does not need to exist in the film , but i can certainly imagine that these are very important events in his life . 

the low budget of the film is clearly discernible . it is a pity that the sound effects are poorly done . the narration and some dialogs ( particularly the scene in the classroom with the french teacher ) have so much echo , which makes it hard to make out what is said . the ambient noise , notable traffic noise , is also captured throughout the film . when a scene cuts into another , the level of traffic noise changes . 

this film is probably not entertaining , but it certainly serves as an insightful diary of a young man ' s journey to embracing his sexuality .  i ' m a fan of judy garland , vincente minnelli , and gene kelly , but this movie just left me cold . i was expecting another american in paris from minnelli , so perhaps i was expecting too much . 

the movie was short on songs and short of impressive dance numbers . i was impressed by the very expressionistic kelly dance as mococo on the ship . i was also impressed by the nicholas brothers in be a clown , too bad the song was so annoying . i also enjoyed judy attacking kelly with bric-a-brac . check lorna luft ' s autobiography for some interesting information on that scene . 

actually , the movie has what must be some of cole porter ' s most annoying songs , especially " nina " . also , judy and gene yell constantly like screechy children . 

the plot is thin--which is par for the course for musicals--but it is not saved by impressive dance numbers or by memorable songs . i suspect the best parts of this movie were left on the cutting room floor . please , some movie restorer , find those bits of film and show us what the movie could have been !  this film was shot in randolph county in central north carolina in 1968 when a film crew in the state was a rare thing . the locations were the municipalities of liberty and ramseur and the surrounding rural countryside . it is not a particularly good movie . it did have merle haggard and it brought life to the hinterlands for a few minutes . 

the plot is standard shootemup . the cinematography is that fuzzy stuff that came out of the late sixties and early seventies . the local folks were thrilled to be a part of the enterprise . 

if viewers have difficulty finding a copy of this film , a record copy is available in asheboro , nc . 

actors not credited include ben jones , mimi pravda , tommy hull , bill nunnery .  i began watching this movie on t . v . some weeks ago , but gave up after the first 10 minutes or so . at the start , the person on the witness protection scheme located in an isolated farmhouse becomes nervous about his exterior placed guards , and then asks the guard inside the house whether he can make a telephone call - only to discover the line has been cut . 

shortly afterwards , roy scheider as one of the witness ' s assassins turns up and duly executes the witness and his wife - upon which the roy scheider character duly picks up the wall telephone in the kitchen , dials a number , and then speaks : it is done ! ! ! ! that was it for me !  although humphrey bogart got star billing in king of the underworld , i ' m willing to bet he didn ' t thank jack warner for it . in fact this film was one hollow crown . 

king of the underworld was supposedly a remake of the paul muni film , dr . socrates , but given humphrey bogart was in the cast , the character is written more like duke mantee in the petrified forest . he even has an english writer along in the person of james stephenson . 

kay francis and john eldredge are a pair of married doctors and eldredge pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of bogart ' s henchmen . bogey ' s a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives eldredge $ 500 . 00 and there ' s more where that came from if he plays his cards right . eldredge who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some undeclared income . 

but when he ' s killed in a raid on the gang ' s hideout , francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the american medical association no matter how much she protests her innocence . it ' s no good and she and her aunt jessie busley move to a small town to get away from the notoriety . 

of course the notoriety and bogart and an itinerant leslie howard like writer in stephenson all meet up with her again . but kay is plucky and resourceful to say the least . 

bogart ' s character was ridiculous , no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts . he ' s a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen hotfoots just for laughs . he ' s concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states . and then let ' s kay francis completely outsmart him , hard to believe he was king of anything . 

definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars .  i once had a conversation with my parents who told me british cinema goers in the 1940s and 50s would check to see a film ' s country of origin before going to see it . it didn ' t matter what the plot was or who was in it , if it was an american movie people would want to see it and if it was british people wouldn ' t want to see it . this might sound like a ridiculous generalisation but after seeing the astonished heart i can understand why people in those days preferred american cinema to the home grown variety back in the 1940s 

british equity was devoid of working class members and it shows in this movie . everyone speaks in an english lad dee daa upper class accent that makes the british royal family sound like working class scum and what this does is alienate a large amount of a potential british audience who would no doubt prefer to be watching jimmy cagney in white heat because people would have , if not related to then certainly empathised with a violent gangster in cinematic terms more than some high class english shrink in 1949 . that ' s entertainment , the reason people go to cinemas . even the characters names seem bizarre - leonora ! how many british people were named leonora in 1949 ? and the protagonists drink cocktails . and they use words like " austere " . you do get the feeling that this wasn ' t marketed for a 1949 mainstream british audience . but why should it if the majority of british cinema goers were queuing up at cinemas to watch far more entertaining american imports ? 

watching the atsonished heart in 2005 i was astonished how dated everything was , in fact it ' s so dated i thought maybe it might be a spoof from the harry endfield show . what didn ' t astonish me was the fact that these types of movie came close to sinking the british film industry , an industry that didn ' t pick up until american money invested in crowd pleasers like zulu , alfie and the james bond movies this weird movie from texas is about fallon , a dilettante rich boy in the late 1800s ( although he looks like a 60s c & w singer with greasy hair and sideburns ) whose ship wrecks on an island owned by count desade ( pronounced de-sayd ) with his captain . the count is afraid of pirates and tortures a young girl who was once a pirate hostage and also tortures the captain . meanwhile , creepy former nurse cassandra tells fallon the secrets of the castle . the countess has leprosy and went mad ! fallon is trapped but brings supplies . the captain is killed by a racist-caricature slave . fallon is thrown in the dungeon with the leper , who always thinks it ' s her wedding day . the leper bride is horny , bu cassandra kills her . fallon and cassandra escape the castle , but the count and his slave chase them with dogs . desade kills the slave and fallon kills desade . fallon and cassandra fall in love over the course of the next year , but when the supply ship comes , the crew refuses to take our lovers because they ' re both lepers now . they live for years in the castle . . . fallon ' s hair turns gray and cassandra goes bonkers . fallon puts her in the dungeon . our tale of love and leprosy ends . 

so bizarre it ' s watchable , and you can smell the drive-in popcorn .  one of the first things i noticed that allowed this culture to stand out among the rest was during the wake at sole ' s place . an aerial shot is used to show sole being flowered with kisses by a sea of women . i believed this was a commentary on the closeness that women had for each other of this cultureÂones who stuck together across the generations , separations and misunderstandings , and still being able to bond and rely on each other . also , the film seemed to glorify women as almost flawless individuals . what i mean by flawless is that they did not suffer the consequences for their actions and were treated as if they had no imperfections . an example of this is shortly after paula accidentally killed her father . her mother immediately comes to her rescue and takes full responsibility for the act while paula seems to suffer almost no remorse for what she has done . again , another example of this is when each daughter ( or granddaughter ) has had an opportunity to reunite with their supposed " dead " mother ( grandmother ) . knowing the stresses that this has most likely caused in their family , each one of them still embraces the mother without care for what she has doneÂthat is , killing her husband and his lover . in this light , women are portrayed as ones who not only love each other independent of character acts , but also ones who don ' t seem bothered in the least by the acts in which their friends / family members perform . 

another idea that i thought was intriguing of this culture was in regards to their idea of the supernatural . with the death of raimunda and sole ' s mother and her inexplicable return , the director builds the audience ' s emotions to believe that this film is going to embody the supernatural . the people depicted in this culture seem very supernatural , that is to say , very eager to believe that life exists beyond the grave . their aunt , long-time friend augustina , the prostitute and other people living in the city of la mancha all believe the rumors of the dead coming back to family members to finish the " unfinished business . " i believed this was a mixed reflection of the culture ' s religious faith ( predominantly catholic ) as well as their need to make amends with those who had no chance to be forgiven during mortality . the belief they held in regards to the dead being " alive " was also to give hope to the destitute circumstances they suffered in mortality . when the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film isn ' t supernatural at all , it ' s interesting to observe the role the mother continues to play . she ' s treated as if she still is a ghost ( i . e . hiding in small crevices ( underneath the bed or inside a car trunk ) ) . i believe the director portrayed the mother this way to heighten the already existent supernatural beliefs the city had adopted . the mother ' s character seemed to be a metaphor for the city ' s long-held belief in life after death .  documentaries about fans are always mishmashes , and never worth seeing through , but i found this one , made by some of the fans themselves , more than usually unenlightening . as a veteran of the original tolkien craze , forty years ago , i ' d hoped for more than the obvious--which doesn ' t always equate to the true . if there ' s anyone living who doesn ' t already know the nature of a fandom , any fandom , from having been or known a fan , he won ' t discover it here . between irrelevancies , platitudes ( to which the actors from the films are particularly prone ) , and acting out ( by fans making the most--if not the best--of their one shot at fame ) , i could glean little of the special appeal of lotr , the special emotional responses it evokes , and the range of the special creative forms those responses can take . in addition , the film is rather lazy : it slights some facts that could have been got across with little effort , e . g . what the exact legal loophole was ( the wording of a copyright notice ) that permitted the books ' unauthorized publication in the u . s . ( speaking of which : i take strong exception to the film ' s dismissal of the covers on that edition as " irrelevant " and " psychedelic , " which they were not . they were the work of jack gaughan , a very able sf illustrator of the period , and some fans , including me , found them more apt , and more attractive , than the covers on the rival set . )  a young man falls in love with a princess but then has to go to battle to save her father ' s kingdom . while away , he accidentally kills an enchanted animal which brings a curse upon him . he becomes a beast and begins to kill even his own comrades . when nobody returns to the kingdom from the battle , the king renders the land of battle cursed and forbids anyone from going there . one day , a rebel who wishes to marry the princess decides that it ' s time they ventured into the cursed land to claim it for the king and the king agrees , when they reach the land the king is captured by the beast and the rebel returns home to lie to the kingdom that the king has been captured and killed . he assumes the throne and prepares to marry the princess but the night before her wedding , the princess escapes to the land to go and battle the beast herself . it is only when she gets to the cursed land that she begins to realise that her father is still alive and that the beast may not even be that evil after all . sadly , her discoveries lead her to pay the ultimate price in their revelation .  sometimes , changes to novels when they ' re made into films are not only necessary , but a good thing . however , in the case of northanger abbey , it ' s a very , very bad thing . not only is the story itself ripped to shreds , but the satire is almost completely absent from the film , and it ' s mixture of romance and intrigue doesn ' t even touch upon the biting commentary that austen put into her work . it fails to be amusing or satirical at all , and instead turns the character ' s fascination with her fantasy world into mostly a drama . 

this affects the romance as well . it ' s meandering and aimless . chemistry and interest are never established . the reasons tilney is attracted to catherine are completely absent from the film , leaving the audience to wonder what it is he sees in her at all . 

hopefully some day soon , we ' ll get a more faithful version if austen ' s satire .  masterpiece . carrot top blows the screen away . never has one movie captured the essence of the human spirit quite like " chairman of the board . " 10 / 10 . . . don ' t miss this instant classic .  this is another film i missed out on italian tv as a kid : notable for its quintet of ageing stars , most of whom had never made a horror film in their life ( fred astaire , melvyn douglas , douglas fairbanks jr . , john houseman and patricia neal ) , it deals with the menâs long-concealed past crime coming back to haunt them . it takes the form of a ghostly dead-ringer for the girl they all loved ( alice krige ) but whom they were forced to dispose of after an unfortunate incident when she humiliated their egos ! fairbanks , who was the one responsible for the deed , has twin sons ( craig wasson ) and so krige directs her revenge upon them as well . soon one of the latter , fairbanks himself and even douglas and houseman all wind up dead . therefore , the remaining wasson and astaire decide to confront the ghost at the scene of the crime where they also have to contend with a couple of sinister tramps who somehow do krigeâs bidding ! i was looking forward to seeing these veterans on their last legs ( douglas died before the film had even premiered though , by that time , he had already completed another role , while it proved astaireâs own inauspicious swan-song ) but ghost story went through too many changes of mood â while maintaining a sluggish pace throughout and emerging overlong into the bargain â to be anything but a failed curio . having dollops of sex ( including full-frontal nudity from wasson ! ) and gruesome make-up effects muddled the waters all the more and marred the old-fashioned elegance inherent in jack cardiffâs ( another notable of long-standing ) cinematography .  heart of darkness , a short novel written by joseph conrad about greed , corruption , and traveling through africa was , to say the least , a tedious read . the narrator follows marlow , a seaman who travels into the deep of africa to rescue kurtz , somewhat of a prodigy ivory trader who supposedly went crazy , this conclusion arose when the ivory stopped coming into the main port . the basis of the story is conrad writing lavishly of the surroundings , he sets the scene wonderfully , but possibly a bit to extensively . the story seemed more like a water color painting , as apposed to the slow creeping mild action story that conrad might have intended to pan out . 

it sometimes happens that after you read a book , maybe watching the feature film might help correspond some thoughts with those in the book , or vise versa . not so with heart of darkness , even with the supporting role of masterpiece actor john malkovich the movie only confused me more , there seemed to be no real main characters in the film , no one stood out to the others , non of the extensive symbolism was explained . it was rather bland and drudging to say the least . 

in all do respect to the author , the heart of darkness is a true short novel masterpiece , it touches on some very severe subjects , the lies of marlow , and the greed of kurtz . it is not a book to be taken lightly , and will put you in a rather somber mood . a book like this i feel might be to heavy for a lot of people . i would however recommend this book to those who crave a sad pseudo action story without a textbook happy ending .  book of revelations starts very well . daniel , an egomaniac dancer is kidnapped , abused and sexually raped by three masked women . 

after that , nothing else really happens . there is some hint of rediscovery but the movie gives nor explanation nor a real ending . daniel reactions after the abuse are very basic . he quits dancing , has sex with every women around and finally starting a relation with very simple and common woman . 

i have seen a good share of art-house movies but this has something missing in it . 

the main leads are fine ; but some characters does not seems to be completely defined .  this is not a good movie at all . i cannot believe that after fifty years , this movie gets the national award when there have been such gems from marathi cinema that have been so systematically ignored . this is a very overrated movie that got very , very lucky . it was given the national award , harvested the popular opinion and now is going to represent india before the international audience . anyone with even a marginal understanding of good , quality cinema will know very well that this will not even be nominated at the oscars . 

i cannot understand where to start . there are just so many things that are wrong and lacking in this movie that it amazing it even got considered for the national award . that this movie is awarded as the best movie to come out this year goes to show the biased judgment of people who hold the reins of indian cinema and the diminutive understanding of the people who blindly appreciate this movie . 

the topic chosen is great . it is important that such movies be made Â but only by people who are able to handle them . sandeep sawant does not measure up to the task Â not even close . his direction is jumpy , confused . there is no clear thought process . he tries , but is not able to explore the depth of the characters , especially the grandfather . he is not able to show the initial horror , anxiety and then hopeless detachment and yet the insurmountable courage of the grandfather . he wastes our time in the hospital when we should have been shown the time pair spend together . he is trying to cram in everything without any priorities . he does not understand his subject properly and that really counts against him . 

however , the cast does not help sawant either . worst job Â amruta shubash . she is a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this or any sensible acting job . how did she get ' tee phulrani ' ? extremely lucky and / or extremely influential and / or extremely pitiful casting . having said that , she goes out of her way to do an even terrible job in this movie . her act of the msw should have gone to the more responsible actor Â sonali kulkarni . amruta subhash did not understand it . msw ' s work under constant emotional stress and yet it is important for them to project a calm , strong exterior , as this is reassuring to the patients . amruta subhash ' s asawari seems even more scared and in need of support than the people she is working for . 

second worst Â arun nalawade . i have never seen a more wooden face in marathi film industry ( it is abound and everywhere in today ' s hindi cinema though ) . he is the producer and so he chose himself ; no second thought , no consideration . any good actor would have jumped to play this role even if he had to pay the producer ' s to do it , but arun nalawade would not let anyone else do it . over ambitious and obtuse , he contributes to bring down the movie more than everyone else combined . his acting lacks research and even the basic acting skills . my choice for this role would be vikram gokhale . 

the music is uninspired . the movie is technically lacking . it could well have been an ftii project job . 

on the up side ; brilliant performance by ashwin chitale . it is amazing that such a young boy could give such a respectable performance . he put many of today ' s actors to shame . unintentionally maybe , but he brought his own innocence to his character and that made it a memorable performance . also , sandeep kulkarni really gave a very believable performance . really put in all his efforts and it shows . the script too is well written . 

 ' shoestring budget ' cannot be a valid argument to praise this movie . lack of funds dogs all of the marathi movies . cricket and hindi movies sponge all the money and the rest are left to fight for the scraps . it is a sorry state of affairs but yet not reason enough to praise any immature movie that comes out . ' doghi ' was brilliant movie and it too was made on a shoestring budget . ' doghi ' also lacked technically but it was well researched and well made . it was abound in details and supported by wonderful performances by everyone and that made it rich cinema . why did it not receive the accolades it so very deserved ? Â only proves my point of biased judgment . 

lack of research and not of funds , is what makes ' shwaas ' such a bad movie .  first : a warning . 

i recently saw this movie on dvd in the universal ' hitchcock collection ' series . the source print looks to be in immaculate condition , but the image is a bit soft , suggesting it might be a second generation copy straight from video . the framing is far too tight , so all the compositions are terrible . even the title of the movie is cropped . i gather from other imdb reviews that there is a much better version available . 

mr and mrs smith is just a footnote to hitchcock ' s career . 

in his lengthy interviews with francois truffaut in the sixties , hitchcock gave a comprehensive overview of his whole body of work , but all he could say about this picture is that he did it as a favour to carole lombard and that he didn ' t understand the characters so just photographed norman krasna ' s screenplay . 

in truth , there is not much more that needs to be said . 

it is a screwball comedy out of the same mould as it happened one night , his girl friday and philapdelphia story . carole lombard is a typically feisty wife who learns that her marriage is technically invalid , falls out with with her husband on the flimsiest of pretexts and spends most of the picture being ' adorably ' unreasonable . 

robert montgomery does well enough as the put upon husband , but it is hard not to lose patience with him . long before the end of the movie the audience is saying : " dump the silly cow , she ' s not worth it . " 

gene raymond plays the best friend with whom she becomes engaged . he is supposed to be a courtly , ' old family ' southerner , although this is not obvious from his accent and only really becomes apparent in the drunk scene ( which he otherwise plays very well ) . he is an honourable , generous , teetotal gentleman , so of course he is bullied and patronised by robert montgomery and made the butt of many of the jokes - although he is not as badly treated as the similar ralph bellamy character in his girl friday . 

this movie feels like it was made by people who only knew of screwball comedies by reputation , but hadn ' t actually seen one . for example , a good screwball comedy has a strong central idea with a number of on-going comic threads that continually intertwine and overlap . here , all the comedy elements are just strung out , like beads on a necklace . this is screwball comedy by the numbers . 

it is the same with the direction . typically , these comedies race along at an ever increasing pace that rises to near hysteria by the end . hitchcock doesn ' t get this . his direction is somewhat lethargic and the picture becomes a stately succession of scenes that all seem slightly over-written ( but under-nourished ) and slightly too long . he was never a particularly good director of actors so he just lets the cast get on with it . they do ok . 

hitchcock had a good sense of humour , which he frequently used in his thrillers , but he had no feel for comedy as a genre . his later trouble with harry was also a misfire , for similar reasons to this movie , but at least he was involved in that picture . here he is just going through the motions . 

all the people connected with this movie were good solid professionals so it is not especially bad . it just feels a bit derivative , over-familiar , over-long and ultimately rather flat . 

mr and mrs smith is one for carole lombard fans and hitchcock completists only .   " happy days " was produced and broadcast from the mid-1970 ' s to the early 1980 ' s and seems to get more ridiculous with age . at the time of its broadcast , most viewers who grew up in the 1950 ' s were in middle age with families , and the scenes at mel ' s diner probably brought an artificial nostalgia to them . the fonz was of course the coolest of the cool ( although the actor henry wrinkler to this day has never learned how to ride a motorcycle ) . richie cunningham was the all-american blond-haired kid who would probably be elected student body president . potsie was richie ' s best friend--the star of the show has to have a best friend , i guess . and ralph malph was the bumbling sidekick to the fonz , if not the entire group . i loved it when the fonz would beat up on poor ralph malph . and there was mel , the middle-aged lug who ran mel ' s diner . and of course who could forget the appearance of mork ? was this really the 1950 ' s ? ironically , films produced during the 1950 ' s , such as " rebel without a cause " and " the wild one " have gotten better with age and portray the period more honestly than this show which was produced 20 years after the period it portrays . 

unfortunately , the tv show " happy days " is not in the same league as " rebel without a cause " or " american graffitti " for that matter . " happy days " may have captured some aspects of the 1950 ' s with its burger diner , juke boxes , cool cars , and tacky plaid shirts , but it is more a nostalgic idealism done strictly for laughs rather than an honest portrayal . " american graffitti " had something to say about young americans in the 1950 ' s whereas " happy days " seemed more about what middle-aged people of the 1970 ' s wished the 1950 ' s had been like . the result was a kind of watered down fabrication that really has nothing to do with the 1950 ' s . " happy days " is , at best , a comedy-fantasy with some of the artificial culture of the 1950 ' s as its backdrop . as pointed out by another reviewer , the all-american kid richie cunningham would probably have been chastised for befriending the likes of a drop-out like fonzie . and mel would probably forbid fonzie from entering his diner . 

a quick history : " happy days " was originally a pilot called " love in the happy days " that was rejected for broadcast . comedy pilots that had themes concerning sex and romance that did not make it to pilot airing sometimes appeared on the infrequently broadcast show " love american style " which was often aired in place of baseball games that had rained out or other unexpected programming cancellations and / or alterations . in short , " love american style " was a throw-away show that contained all these one-episode comedy pilots that never made it to a slotted debut . " love in the happy days " did appear as a " love american style " show sometime in the early 1970 ' s , but at the time tv executives could not foresee how a show about 1950 ' s young people would be popular , particularly during the hey-day of comedy shows centering around middle-aged people , such as the " mary tyler moore show " ( and its subsequent spin-offs such " rhoda " ) , " the bob newhart show " , and " all in the family " . ( how things have changed since now most tv sitcoms are about young people and the industry avoids most shows about middle-aged people like the plague ! ) 

subsequently , one of the young stars of " love in the happy days " , a child actor from " the andy griffith show " named ron howard , got the chance to star in a film about young people taking place in 1959 called " american graffitti " directed by the relatively unknown george lucas whose previous " thx 1138 " had bombed miserably at the box office . even when it was premiered to movie executives , again the studios could not see how a movie about young people in the 1950 ' s could become popular because it didn ' t " fit " with what had been popular in the past , although they didn ' t realize that much of the movie-going audience had been young in the 1950 ' s . as everyone knows , the movie was a huge hit , and studio executives recognized that they had completely misjudged their audience . somewhere during the theatrical run of " american graffitti " , tv executives realized they had a comedy pilot in their vault that was a lot like " american graffitti " . they brought it back with the original cast , plus henry wrinkler as " the fonz " , re-titled it " happy days " and the rest is tv history as it became one of the most popular shows of the 1970 ' s . 

 " happy days " now seems ridiculous . the characters are flat and cardboard , never being more or less than what they superficially are . the issues they deal with are trivial . and their reactions appear mindless and even silly . nowadays , the character of the fonz seems to be a caricature of , well , the fonz . was the idea to be a kind of parody of marlon brando ' s character in " the wild one " ? looking on the show with fresh eyes , i feel the producers really missed out on a great opportunity to present the 1950 ' s with depth and realism that still could be fun and entertaining . instead the producers decided on cheap laughs for quick bucks . this is definitely a show that has not withstood the test of time . " american graffitti " has many of the outward appearances of " happy days " but it had an edge . it had an honesty about the characters and their issues . " happy days " took the look of " american graffitti " but failed to take its heart .  give director stanley tong of jackie chan ' s super cop and rumble in the bronx , and what do you get ? you receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of magoo-like madness . 

the limited plot has magoo ( leslie nielsen ) put into an international plot , where he steals a world-renowned gem . of course he has no idea what he is doing . in fact , he has no idea that he had the gem . 

within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this . there are some very funny moments though like when he is cooking the chicken . you will wish that you were as nearsighted as magoo . its a fun movie to watch but its quite a disaster ! you have to love leslie nielson because he was made some very funny movies . this isn ' t his best , but he does a good job playing magoo . i thought it was a funny film , and it should be recommended to young children because they will probably think that its very funny .  you may be interested to know that barricade was viewed as a failure by the studio and shelved for a year before alice faye ' s popularity reached such a high that the studio decided to release the film despite the fact that it was never fully completed . it fared modestly ok at the box-office . 

faye refers to a murder during her nightclub stint in new york city--and this scene was actually in the script and was the way the film was to start . instead , it is entirely missing and what could have been an exciting sequence ( including a complete song number by faye ) was never filmed . however , the rest of the story is pretty much intact and made release of the film possible at a running time of 71 minutes . 

a tired looking warner baxter is too old to be believable as faye ' s romantic interest and is merely perfunctory as the broken down reporter . audiences today would be offended by the depiction of chinese using fractured english phrases like " me likey make noisy " . key luke is one of the chinese loyalists but plays his role in a low-key , straightforward way . arthur treacher is all but invisible and yet gets fourth billing on screen due to editing changes in the story . originally , joseph schildkraut had a role in the film but his part was eventually edited out . 

a mishmash of a film that will serve as entertainment only for the most die-hard alice faye fans who will get a chance to see her in a dramatic role--albeit a weak one . charles winninger is totally wasted as a kindly man running the american consulate . 

despite all the weaknesses , there are a couple of scenes involving narrow escapes that are effectively played and karl freund ' s b & w photography is top notch .  an intelligent summation of cold war era mutually assured destruction policy , up until the conclusion : it ' s a gasser ! all russians and chinese are obliterated from the face of the earth ! saw this one at the 27th annual cwru science fiction marathon , january 2002 .   " tragic hero " is a film that is most definitely trying to emulate the classic godfather films , focusing on family , crime , loyalty , and revenge . also , this is part of a two part series as the godfather also was ( at the time ) . however , this film comes nowhere near the level of those classic films and actually fairs worse than other triad thrillers being released in hong kong at the time . 

one reason is the acting . with the exception of chow yun fat , the acting is generally over the top and unbelievable . the audience tends to find the proceedings humorous simply because the actors ' inability to maintain any degree of seriousness . as a result , we find the film not truly emotionally involving or intense since we don ' t particularly care what occurs with these characters . 

another reason is its lack of focus . the narrative tries to incorporate many different story elements into the film , but this results in portions of the movie becoming underdeveloped as well as lacking any real sense of coherency . the audience sometimes becomes lost at the proceedings we are viewing , not knowing what the character ' s motivations are . 

the film ' s climax does contain a decent gun fight , but again since we don ' t care about the characters , we don ' t care who lives or who dies ; the scene loses it ' s intensity and suspense because of this . the other action set pieces are rather mundane in nature , with a feeling of it being too controlled rather than free flowing . 

in general , this is a strictly average film and isn ' t recommended to the general film viewer . . . only hard core genre enthusiasts and fans of chow yun fat should consider this film for viewing .  contains spoilers . 

the british director j . lee thompson made some excellent films , notably ' ice cold in alex ' and ' cape fear ' , but ' country dance ' is one of his more curious offerings . the story is set among the upper classes of rural scotland , and details the strange triangular relationship between sir charles ferguson , an eccentric aristocratic landowner , his sister hilary , and hilary ' s estranged husband douglas , who is hoping for a reconciliation with her . we learn that during his career as an army officer , charles was regarded as having ' low moral fibre ' . this appears to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition ; throughout the film he displays an attitude of gloomy disillusionment with the world , and his main sources of emotional support seem to be hilary and his whisky bottle . the film ends with his committal to an upper-class lunatic asylum . 

peter o ' toole was , when he was at his best as in ' lawrence of arabia ' , one of britain ' s leading actors , but the quality of his work was very uneven , and ' country dance ' is not one of his better films . he overacts frantically , making charles into a caricature of the useless inbred aristocrat , as though he were auditioning for a part in the monty python ' upper-class twit of the year ' sketch . susannah york as hilary and michael craig as douglas are rather better , but there is no really outstanding acting performance in the film . there is also little in the way of coherent plot , beyond the tale of charles ' s inexorable downward slide . 

the main problem with the film , however , is neither the acting nor the plot , but rather that of the theme that dare not speak its name . there are half-hearted hints of an incestuous relationship between charles and hilary , or at least of an incestuous attraction towards her on his part , and that his dislike of douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy . unfortunately , even in the swinging sixties and early seventies ( the date of the film is variously given as either 1969 or 1970 ) there was a limit to what the british board of film censors was willing to allow , and a film with an explicitly incestuous theme was definitely off-limits . ( the american title for the film was ' brotherly love ' , but this was not used in britain ; was it too suggestive for the liking of the bbfc ? ) these hints are therefore never developed and we never get to see what motivates charles or what has caused his moral collapse , resulting in a hollow film with a hole at its centre . 4 / 10 beware , my lovely ( 1952 ) dir : harry horner 

production : the filmmakers / rko radio pictures

credulity-straining thriller from the pioneering producer team of collier young and ida lupino , aka the filmmakers ( with lupino pitching in with some uncredited direction ) . 

robert ryan is the ' peril ' and ida lupino is the ' woman ' in this entry in the ' woman in peril ' style film . ryan plays howard wilton , a tightly-wound psychotic handyman drifter ( noooo , ryan ? i know , hard to believe ) . lupino is the lonely war widow , helen gordon , who hires howard to do some work around her house . things go downhill from there as howard makes helen a prisoner in her own home . 

howard has a nasty secret , not that he could reveal it . you see , consciousness is a real challenge for him . maintaining it , that is . he has an unfortunate habit of coming to and finding his employers dead . this is part of the film ' s problem . the nature of howard ' s psychosis is so extreme that it is nearly impossible to believe that he ' s been free to roam from town to town unobstructed , even in the year 1918 ( when the film is set ) . he can ' t remember anything that happened ten minutes ago . his violent , threatening , anti-social tendencies are set off by the smallest and most common of things ( a young girl flirting , inadequacies involving the war , due to his being rejected for service ) . i don ' t know how he even made it past the interview with helen . there are other implausibilities . if you were locked in your house with a madman , but nonetheless left on your own for periods of time , couldn ' t you figure out a way to escape ? 

ryan , i think , is defeated by the material . it feels like he ' s overplaying his hand . his series of tics and spasms and the tightly coiled bursts of dementia all have a been-there , done-that robotic feel to them . at this point in his career he ' d probably played this character , to some degree , ten times and it shows . we are encouraged to empathize with howard ( i didn ' t ) through shown bits of humanity , like him being stopped in his tracks by a music box and his relating to a group of children who won ' t judge him . lupino just has to act frazzled and in distress , which she is more than capable of and does . 

the picture had one thing going for it ; what would be the eventual resolution of the conflict ? so naturally there was a disappointing ending that was abrupt and ineffective . 

of slight interest was a recurring motif where the camera would catch howard ' s reflection ( in mirrors , water , christmas tree decorations ) . this indicated something going on , or about to go on , in his head . horner ( 1953 ' s vicki ) , who made his reputation in production design , does a fine job of making the house feel like a prison . credit too , the always reliable rko art department for the work on the house . in the end , sub-standard work from the principals , who all have much better films to their credit . 

 * Â½ out of 4 firstly this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of kung fu starring gordon liu . i mention this as my kung fu theater presents dvd has a totally misleading picture on the cover , the wrong plot on the back and goes on to mention ( no idea why ) the young hero starring hwang jang lee . apart from an introduction to the history of the 18 weapons style told by a monk to some children during the opening and the usual mysterious manual that everyone is after , the weapons never really appear again and the fights are all boxing style . the hero is lee shao hwa who i have never heard of before or any of the other actors . the film mentions another director wu yuen ling as well as the one imdb lists . the other actors are wang fu quen , wang wing san , chen fei fei , wang ki san , suen king kai and hwa yue suen who seem to have sunk without trace after this film . the fights are reasonable and frequent but not great and the ' star ' doesn ' t have much charisma . the twist at the end is just stupid and the film seems to end abruptly as though they got bored with it . the scenery and the training sequences in the river are a little different from usual . unfortunately the pretty sister gets drowned not the very irritating ( though acrobatic ) young boy .  right this moment i am watching this movie on tv here in tokyo . beautiful scenery , beautiful sets of biblical proportions , beautiful costumes , beautiful color , beautiful gina . great climactic scene when god destroys the sheban idol and a lot more with de millean thunderbolts at the moment when yul and gina are about to consummate their love . yul does a halfway decent job of delivering his lines , though he sounds a lot like yul delivering his lines as ramses or taras bulba . george sanders sounds like george sanders playing george sanders . given the limited range of acting she is asked to display in this role , gina does a good job , though by the time the movie ends , she is completely converted into a demure remorseful lass and looks likes she might be playing in a biography of mother teresa . i guess thunderbolts will do that to you , but it is almost breathtaking how quickly she jettisons her own beliefs for her new religion . the supporting players are mostly awful , lacking credible emotion and timing . the usual big battle scenes , what passed for lascivious dances in 1959 , and an orchestra blasting out plenty of trumpet calls behind a huge chorus singing lots of " ah ' s " , but none of it quite of topnotch hollywood quality . the final swordfight between brynner and sanders is at the laughingly low skill level of a junior high school play . the film is one big piece of eye candy but not much more .  michael feifer writes and directs this fictitious story based on the arrest of edward gein in plainfield , wisconsin . gein was responsible for a rash of gruesome murders that sent a shock wave of terror through his rural hometown in the late 1950 ' s . his evil mind and twisted world is suspected to be caused by his domineering zealous lutheran mother . ed was given the nickname " the butcher of plainfield " . he would rob corpses from fresh graves of women who resembled his mother and he would have sex with them before ' dressing them like a deer ' in his garage . severed heads with bodies hanging upside down being his personal trademark . after his arrest there would be many articles made from human skin found in his home . in this movie , a young deputy bobby mason ( shawn hoffman ) makes the search for gein ( kane hodder ) a personal one , when his storekeeper mother ( priscilla barnes ) goes missing . the acting is a whole lot better than the ridiculously liberal telling of the documented events concerning gein . also in the cast : adrienne frantz , timothy oman , john burke , michael berryman and amy lyndon .  an epic story of hope constrained by budget and limited artistic ambition . seeing as terrence malick produced this , i expected something haunting and lyrical . instead , we get a typical norwegian co-production ( " revolution " with al pacino , anyone ? ) , where - quite possibly - good intentions are scuppered by a dreadful screenplay , and where many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes . the " me-tarzan-you-jane " english dialogue between the non-english-speaking protagonists is particularly cringeworthy Â one could speculate whether nick nolte and tim roth ad-libbed their own , as they almost sound like real people . the story is loaded with implausibility : we are expected to believe that binh can speak a smattering of english after having spent his entire life living as a peasant slave ( his vocabulary , but unfortunately not grammatical command , increases impressively in the malayan refugee camp , without the benefit of night classes ) . coincidence is rife ; i wonder whether an hour or two has been edited from the first third : he tracks down his mother in ho chi minh city almost immediately - after bumping into his thirty year younger half brother , who nonchalantly recognises him ! mum gives him a gold locket ( or something similar of great value ) as they part , but this is never referred to again . his relationship with " me dead inside " ling is supposed to provide the obligatory " love interest " , but feels as artificial as leonardo and cameron in " gangs of new york " . 

the voyage in the rust bucket of a boat does convey a sense of the appalling conditions that human trafficking entails . indeed , the only time the film is remotely exciting and unpredictable , is the jerky , hand-held footage shot from the bridge during choppy weather conditions . ( incidentally , a boat cruise from malaysia to new york via the cape of good hope and the african coast , without stopping for fuel or supplies , is certainly an epic journey ) . the beautiful shot of the new york skyline echoes malick ' s use of magic hour , but i want to know why the coast guard didn ' t show up . perhaps they were watching the super bowl , or something . of course , binh manages to track down his blind old dad on a remote farm in texas , with the same navigational flair he displayed in ho chi minh city . i was impressed at how nick nolte could wander around digging fields and feeding horses on a large ranch without the aid of a guide dog or white stick . for demonstration of how a story about the travails befalling refugees could be structured and shot on a small budget , check out michael winterbottom ' s far superior " in this world " .  two movies : " the fifth element " , " armageddon " . the same subject : to save the world . the same main actor : bruce willis . one difference : " armageddon " is very inferior to luc besson ' s film . some spectacular special effects don ' t succeed in hiding a labored and globally conventional screenplay . several parts of the movie are showing it . i think about the president ' s speech and especially willis ' relationship with his daughter , " grace " . at the beginning of the movie , he tends to neglect and overprotect her and this makes her weary . then , at the end of the movie , it ' s true love and understanding that shine in him . on another hand , the movie falls in the following trap : michael bay takes his subject too seriously . of course , the movie tries to be funny but the result doesn ' t work as the humor introduced in the movie is often crude and pretty low-level whereas in the " fifth element " , the humor was zany , involuntary and enabled to overlook the serious side of the action . the movie suffers from two other handicaps : it often falls into the ridiculous ( the russian astronaut ) and almost all the actors are bad used . bruce willis is all the contrary of his " fifth element " ' s character . he plays the he-man , he hams it up and sometimes , he ' s unbearable . the other actors are barely credible in their own roles , particularly , willis ' sinking crew . it seems that this crew is here just for having fun . one of them is taken for being very qualified but he looks like a fool . and poor liv tyler ! she ' s at the nasa just to be decorative . 

when the movie was released in france in august 1998 , bruce willis expressed is weariness of saving the world . his weariness was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie .  this is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between required public life and the need for privacy . robert taylor has been primed by corporate head burl ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation . he sends him to england to negotiate a deal , where taylor is both taken aback by the ethics and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he ' s at it . he comes back emtpy handed , having done his duty but having told the truth to the english about his motives . he attempts to marry the refugee rather than the boss ' s niece and so begins an attempt by ives to discredit the refugee as a suitable wife for a corporate executive . it could have been gritter , nastier and less romantic - the amount of time spent on the romance skews the film away from the points it ' s trying to make about corporate ethics . 

somehow the costume design was nominated ( undeservedly ) for an oscar - it ' s all business suits and the two women in the film dress conservatively - studio politics at work yet again , no doubt . 

what is stiking however is the black and white cinemascope cinematography which is excellent - this if anything deserved the oscar nom . ( it was mgm ' s first ' scope film in b & w ) . 

not as good as it could have been but not terrible either .  this film was actually shot and made in 1987 but it didn ' t hit the theaters until 1990 . as i watched this film i could see the good intentions that it had but i ' m afraid there wasn ' t much talent or experience behind the camera to make it work . story takes place in california in the 1890 ' s and some italian immigrants who own vineyards are told they have to leave their land so a railroad can come through . dennis hopper plays william berrigan who has offered money for the land but has been turned down . giancarlo giannini is sebastian collogero and he is to proud to leave and asks the other farmers to stand up and fight to keep their land . berrigan grows impatient and hires a bunch of thugs to force everyone to vacate . these thugs are headed by a man named andrews ( burt young ) and he doesn ' t hesitate to kill anyone who gives him problems . andrews and his men kill collogero one night and his son marco ( eric roberts ) vows to seek revenge and get the land back for everyone . marco blows up the bridge that the railroad was going to need and they also destroy a tunnel and this sets back the project for several months and berrigan now starts to get heat from other investors . this film was directed by peter masterson and besides " the trip to bountiful " he has at best a spotty career in directing . he ' s a fine actor but here he seems to be in over his head . this was a film that desperately needed more attention to detail and its easy to see that it didn ' t occur . roberts hairstyle is perfect for the 1980 ' s but this is suppose to be 1890 ! the cinematographer is toyomichi kurita who ended up being a good cameraman but this was only his fourth film and he certainly had not learned everything at that time . its not a sharp looking film at all and i noticed in several shots during the day that the sun would be glaring off of something and the scenes just don ' t have the crispness that would have helped the overall look . the script is just a revenge story and no surprises take place during the course of the film . we know giannini is going to get it and it seemed just a matter of time . the cast is top notch and they do their best but the whole film comes across as uninspired . this was promoted as julia roberts film debut but i ' m not sure that is correct . she might have appeared in a film called " firehouse " before this .  decent but overrated dramatic thriller , film attempts to depict the spiraling out-of-control inner demons of a tormented artist . the problem is , not a single relationship illustrated on screen is believable , and plausibility appears to have been thrown out the window . the title character is so difficult to relate to making it ' s rather impossible to imagine any of the on- screen characters emotionally invested in him either . the conclusion is also fairly predictable ; there are certainly enough clues provided from the get go to indicate exactly where the story is headed . choosing to entirely suspend one ' s belief in the situations or the relationships , the film itself is well acted ( especially by the leads ) and manages to create some nice tension as the story unfolds . as a metaphorical feature there is some food for thought , and had the script been stronger , there ' s certainly potential here that could have been put to better use .  the third film based on charles belden ' s play entitled " mystery of the wax museum " ( 1933 ) targets generation x-tasy . twin screenwriters , chad hayes and carey w . hayes , spend more time developing the main characters than other slasher movies--a promising start . their condition guarantees an authentic point of view . the role of paige ( paris hilton ) was not much of a stretch for the world ' s favorite heiress . she peruses " in style , " stripteases boys , chats on a cell , and frets over an ill-conceived pregnancy . her regular routine has been altered beyond repair . hilton reached the peak of her performance--not so hot--during the " 1 night in paris " ( 2004 ) parody . while the pimp-my-ride is in motion , she zealously " looks for lip balm " in her boyfriend ' s ( robert ri ' chard ) lap . finally , the " actress " atones for using the " n " word on the sex tape . director jaume collet-serra molds his take on the twin thing contrary to the theme of the past . each exhibited opposite characteristics back then , whereas a pair of either good or bad can come out the womb today . however , the latter does not rule out the former . childbirth constitutes the luck of the draw . spectators can hardly consider vincent ( brian van holt ) a contemporary quasimodo . granted , the recluses share some similarities such as artistry , disfigurement , submissiveness , and murder . yet , one small variable between the two makes all the difference . vincent is even uglier on the inside than he is on the out . collet-serra ' s " house of wax " pays homage to actor vincent price from the first remake in 1953 . the film leaves obvious van gogh puns to the imagination of the audience . still , the choice to split the antagonist in two eliminates a vibrant twist at the end . professor henry ( vincent price ) jarrod ' s unmasking receives runner-up , but the most terrifying one in horror movie history belongs to lon chaney in " phantom of the opera " ( 1925 ) . as far as the new contender is concerned , the aftermath of separation surgery downplays the effect . a surgeon should know operating on siamese twins scars them--physically and psychologically . their father needs to call a couple colleagues--dr . phil to consult and dr . mcnamara to nip / tuck . despite what the trailers said , " wax " is not forever . in fact , you can rid yourself of it by burning it .  based on the elmore leonard novel of the same name , killshot suffers from a lack of focus , direction , and creativity Â all elements which the original story likely had , and negative test screenings forced severe edits , ( including the complete excising of a character ) resulting in a film that feels almost nothing like a leonard story . far too many characters populate a storyline too simplistic and straightforward ( not a typical trait of the author ' s work ) and the focus continually switches between two hit men who are difficult to like and a troubled couple who don ' t command our sympathy . while the story itself provides precious few twists and turns , sadly by the end of the film its appeal still remains a mystery . 

washed-up hit-man armand " the blackbird " degas ( mickey rourke ) follows a strict code during his missions that inadvertently sours his latest assignment . now on the run from his former employer , he haphazardly joins forces with inept misfit criminal richie nix ( joseph gordon-levitt ) to gain some quick cash by extorting a wealthy realtor . when struggling couple carmen and wayne colson ( diane lane and thomas jane ) are privy to the thieves ' blundered plot , they are forced into hiding as the crazed killers will stop at nothing to silence the two witnesses . 

killshot proves that being based on an elmore leonard novel isn ' t grounds for immediate success or even a promising adaptation . the characters , situations , and even resolutions in the film are all tired and unoriginal and only very randomly hint at something more . it ' s not that there wasn ' t potential , especially when rourke ' s black-garbed , calm and collected assassin perfectly executes a hit during the opening scene Â purpose and principals are just continually abandoned as each minute ticks away . the style and manner in which each character is introduced is the most intriguing ; visually the roles of bird and even wayne are fleshed out befittingly , giving immediate interest and depth to personas that typically end in a creative impasse . 

the pairing of the cold and calculating black bird with the irrational and explosive richie is an enticing combination ( comparisons to fargo would be extravagantly too kind ) , except that each character seems to slowly lose track of the traits that kept them initially interesting . as richie starts picking up the more experienced killer ' s habits , bird loosens his grip on his own methods of murder . regardless of what he sees in his momentary lighthearted fling with donna ( rosario dawson ) , it ' s hard to imagine that his final confrontation with panicky carmen would provoke a confession of his true nature and subsequent carelessness that drastically affects his outcome . likely or not , this is killshot ' s unfortunate downfall Â and little entertainment can be garnered from these characters who steadily lose their originality by continually contradicting the habits that once made them intriguing . 

- the massie twins  " haaaarrrryyy ! " 

the amplified , dispassionate female voice could have been leona helmseley in heat but , no , it belongs to allison hayes as nancy archer , the 50-foot woman of the title . in the most infamous role of her film career , allison ' s performance literally rips off the roof . in fact , make that a couple of roofs . 

jaw-droppingly tacky , " aot50fw " is the tale of nancy , a neurotic , boozy heiress and her loveless lothario husband , harry ( william hudson , who also co-starred opposite the amazing colossal man ) . nancy has a close encounter of the third kind , in the desert , with a bald giant from outer space who wears a mini-skirt and gladiator sandals , and who has a thing for nancy ' s jewelry . what he does to her once he ' s carried her off is probably best left a mystery , but soon nancy starts to grow . 

treading into the center of town on tranquilizers , tightly wrapped in nothing but the bed sheets , the buxom giantess heads toward the low-rent saloon where harry is having a few laughs with a floozy named honey ( yvette vickers ) . the confrontation turns ugly . 

the poverty row f / x make the alien giant and nancy appear to be transparent due to incompetently transposed images . you ' ll understand why director nathan juran changed his name to nathan hertz on the credits . juran was no stranger to directing giant creatures , human and non , having also directed " the deadly mantis , " " the 7th voyage of sinbad , " " jack , the giant killer " plus several episodes of tv ' s " world of giants " and " land of the giants . " 

a lot of laughs for all the wrong reasons .  with an interesting premise ( in the conflicts between europeans and indigenous peoples sometimes the battle lines were not so clear ) , this should have been a good film . but the story is sabotaged by the director ' s overriding infatuation with his own cleverness twinned with a very poor script . 

yes , the natural setting is beautiful and , yes , the movie is authentic to its 19th century historical setting . but the filmmaker keeps gilding the lily over and over again , adding layer upon layer of over-the-top musical accompaniment , not to mention a completely unnecessary voice-over , to the soundtrack , that ultimately overwhelm the viewer and , by calling attention to themselves , take away from the story . 

to me , it was clear the director , with his microscopic closeups and the endless recurrence of the musical motif of " danny boy " ( of all things ! ) was trying to make a new zealand version of an epic sergio leone film , something on the order of once upon a time in the west . but given the earnestness of the story ( most of leone ' s westerns were tongue-in-cheek ) , not to mention that it ' s no longer 1968 , he succeeds in making a parody of one . 

too bad .  academy awarding actor sidney poitier of " lilies of the field " reprises his role as lieutenant virgil tibbs from the 1967 oscar winning best picture " in the heat of the night " for veteran director gordon douglas ' tired , uninspired sequel " they call me mister tibbs , " with nobody the equivalent of rod steiger with which to swap dialogue . clearly , both " bullitt " scenarist alan r . trustman and robert d . webb of " cape fear " were off their game when they penned this predictable police procedural potboiler . the dialogue is drab and none of the characters are interesting , not even the chief suspect . absolutely nothing remotely exciting , suspenseful , or surprising occurs in this tame whodunit . meanwhile , things have changed considerably since virgil was last seen in " in the heat of the night . " he worked as a homicide detective for the philadelphia , pennsylvania , police department . in " they call me mister tibbs , " our hero works for the san francisco police department . moreover , he has a wife , valerie ( barbara mcnair of " change of habit " ) , and a family , a young rebellious son , andy ( george spell of " the naked kiss " ) , and a younger doting daughter , ginger ( wanda spell of " hickey and boggs " ) . tibbs drives a medium blue mustang and his wife holds down the house and hovers over their two children since he doesn ' t have as much time to spend with them . literally , there are no surprises in this pedestrian murder mystery . indeed , the best thing about " they call me mister tibbs " is quincy jones ' terrific orchestral soundtrack with a memorable opening theme , more memorable than this forgettable crime thriller deserved . 

everything begins sensationally enough with a struggling prostitute , joy sturges ( linda towne of " the adventurers " ) , being bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of her downtown apartment by an unseen assailant . apartment handyman mealie williamson ( juano hernandez of " intruder in the dust " ) enters joy ' s apartment and finds her strewn on the carpet dead with a bloody forehead . he picks up the statue briefly and then puts it back on the floor and reports joy ' s death to the superintendent of the apartment , rice weedon ( anthony zerbe of " license to kill " ) , and weedon gives mealie and fistful of dollars and sends him packing . afterward , weedon anonymously notifies the sfpd that popular minister logan sharpe ( martin landau of " nevada smith " ) beaten joy to death and was seem leaving joy ' s apartment . captain marden ( jeff corey of " true grit " ) assigns tibbs to handle the case ; it seems that both tibbs and sharpe have known each other for 18 years . naturally , tibbs ' wife valerie cannot believe that the well-known , politically active evangelist could have committed such a crime . just to give the movie context , it should be noted that when tibbs and the police study the crime scene , they mention the word ' semen , ' no doubt a controversial term to mention in an early 1970s movie . 

tibbs questions weedon whom he suspects is either a drug pusher or a pimp . weedon explains that he has no records on joy sturges because she was subletting the apartment from another realty company . tibbs visits the realty company and realtor woody garfield ( ed anser of " jfk " ) flees and drives off , essentially doing an o . j . simpson until he crashes his car after a lengthy but tame pursuit . when tibbs proves that woody didn ' t kill joy , he allows him to leave , with his disgruntled wife , marge ( norma crane of " penelope " ) , prepared to file for divorce after the revelation that he paid a hooker to stay in an apartment . 

tibbs tracks down handyman mealie and clears him of the crime , and then he goes after weedon . luckily , for tibbs , our hero catches the evil weedon in the middle of a narcotics transaction . one of weedon ' s henchmen assaults tibbs , but tibbs dispenses with him briefly before he embarks on a long foot chase after weedon . eventually , he corners weedon in an underground parking garage and they shoot it out . guess who wins . 

the scenes in the tibbs ' household are more interesting than his investigation . andy runs rampant , striking his sister , and smoking in the garden . our hero wants him to clean up his room . when andy refuses , tibbs pops him three times on the jaw . these child rearing scenes could probably never be handled today as they were back in 1970 . at the end of the movie , as if to solidify the family sequence , tibbs is seen walking off with his wife and kids . there is on confrontation between valerie and virgil about the welfare of their children and how his long hours at work has affected them . 

director gordon douglas directs in competent fashion . surprisingly , for a film released in 1970 , the filmmakers never play the race card . in one scene , when tibbs searches a billiards parlor owned by an african-american , we see a mixed breed of races scowling at the hero when he finds mealie and leaves with him in tow . 

altogether , " they call me mister tibbs " is a poor follow-up to " in the heat of the night . " mind you , poitier delivers another fine performance with nuance , but everything looks prefabricated . all of the sets look fake and there isn ' t much physical violence : one underground parking lot shoot-out that doesn ' t last long and a fight . beyond jones ' seminal jazz score , the only surpriseÂand it really doesn ' t qualify as a major surprise more like a convenient contrivanceÂis the ending . donald medford ' s " the organization " followed " they call me mister tibbs " as the second , more action-packed sequel .  storyline drags . drug smugglers a beautiful women and a determined cop . nothing not already done a hundred times before . the boat sceen will be well worth the wait amsterdam is the perfect city to pull it off . the canals and waterways put you on the edge of your seat . i would say the same as did the car chase in bullitt , very intense ! .  this is a fact that this is the 1st saudi feature film to be shown in cinema theaters but not in saudi arabia for a simple reason we don ' t have cinema theaters in our large kingdom . . not only one cinema theater ! the government forbidden opening cinema theaters after the islamic extremists or the religious police ( or both ) asked for closing it in the late 1970s & the early 1980s . . accusing the 7th art with encouraging wrong sex relationships and stuff like that . . i don ' t see a powerful reason why we don ' t open cinema theaters ! ! . . we have many videos stores throughout the kingdom , we watch movies in the tv from some satellite channels , we can install the " showtime " set channels and after all movies in general seems harmless in many ways . . i know many people how go to neighboring countries only to watch a couple of films . . i personally went to bahrain several times only to watch films in theaters because watching it there is big fun unlike watching a movie home . saudis pay the most expensive cinema ticket in the world , we travel to watch movies while the rest of the world have cinema theaters around every town . this is one of the problems that we are having ! ! . . 

the movie is produced and presented by rotana filmed entertainment which is a major company belongs to the saudi tycoon-prince alwaleed bin talal ( the 8th richest man in the world ) . 

the movie ' s title is a word means literally " how are you ? " but it is also a slang means " what ' s up ! " , sometimes used as a slang to say " bad " about something and sometimes is used as a slang to tell someone politely to mind his business & not to interfere in someone else ' s affairs . anyway , i think they meant ( how are you ) & ( what ' s up ! ) in the same time , i could be wrong though . 

male actors are from saudi arabia like hisham abdulrahman who is very famous and has some popularity after winning 1st prize in arabian realty show more like " american idol " , he works in some tv programs like the arabian version of " cash taxi " . . the other famous actor is khaled sami who is funny and has a very good sense of humor . . other actors like mishal al-mutairi , turki al-yusuf and ali al sabea are less famous and they work on some tv series shows . female actresses are non-saudis and they did a very good job speaking the saudi accent . . jordanian actress mais hamdan in leading role & emeriti actress fatima al-hawsani . . not that we don ' t have saudi actresses but are few and not that good . 

a saudi critic " rja al-mutairi " who writes for alriyadh newspaper ( the most popular newspaper in the kingdom ) wrote about it saying : " lets not expect much of the 1st saudi feature film . it was born in unusual circumstances therefore we can ' t judge it under the usual standards like any other film . it is a fact that the movie hit a huge financial success in its 1st opening days only in kingdom of bahrain . the movie is fresh and is about a saudi family deals ( interacts ) with controversial fresh issues inside the saudi society like : women driving cars , the low-shallow thoughts about the arts , the guardianship of the society by a certain group & the differences between being conservative and being an extremist . the ideas are good but you feel you are lost in the middle of the movie . one of the movie ' s advantages is the beautiful music score by rajeh dawood which was good but sometimes it doesn ' t match or express what ' s in the picture . turki al-yusuf did a great job . . his performance was the best alongside with mais hamdan . . the biggest loser is the leading actor hisham abdulrahman who came behind the supporting actors mishal al-mutairi , ali al sabea and khaled sami who did a good job within the limits of their roles . 

after all , " keif al-hal ? " even with all of its disadvantages still an ok movie and it is a very good 1st step of rotana . . and the movie became the speech of people and streets which is a golden goal to make a strong debates inside the saudi society about movies in general until they become aware of the importance of the 7th art and other arts " 

ps : there is another saudi filmmaker " abdullah almohaisen " claims that he directed the 1st saudi movie titled " shadows of silence " . 

i haven ' t seen the movie yet . . i hope i ' ve been helpful .  i will admit i didn ' t pay full attention to everything going on in this film , but to be honest , i don ' t think it would have mattered . basically local councillor sidney fiddler ( sid james ) persuades the incompetent mayor frederick bumble ( kenneth connor ) of firecombe to hold a beauty contest , to improve the town ' s image . they face opposition from women ' s liberationist augusta prodworthy ( june whitfield ) trying to sabotage the contest , but they do have publicity agent peter potter ( bernard bresslaw ) and palace hotel owner connie philpotts ( joan sims ) . soon enough the young , beautiful wannabe models show up , including hope springs ( barbara windsor ) , paula perkins ( valerie leon ) , dawn brakes ( goldfinger ' s margaret nolan ) , debra ( sally geeson ) and ida downs ( eastenders ' wendy richard ) . when the girls have cat fights , it does draw away regular residents , but after quite a while of some plodding not that funny innuendos and william ( jack douglas ) having over-active twitches , it does finally reach the competition , and it ' s just afterwards i couldn ' t be bothered . also starring patsy rowlands as mildred bumble , peter butterworth as admiral , joan hickson as mrs . dukes , david lodge as police inspector , angela grant as miss bangor , arnold ridley as councillor pratt , robin askwith as larry , patricia franklin as rosemary , jimmy logan as cecil gaybody and dad ' s army ' s bill pertwee as fire brigade chief , charles hawtrey had obviously quit the carry ons , but where ' s kenneth williams ? i suppose seeing babs and young , beautiful looking pauline fowler in bikinis , but for comedy value , this fails miserably , and the overuse of the swanny whistle just gets on your nerves . pretty poor !  carole lombard stars in this transition period film . this film is a typical example of a very early " talkie " ( first practical sound film was " the jazz singer " , 1927 ) . overall , the acting in this film tends to be extremely broad and very melodramatic . 

the viewer may easily note that the actors are still " acting " for a silent film , and this combined with the overly pronounced , overly earnest dialog ( it seems most likely a diction-elocution-drama coach was employed extensively to teach the " silent " actors to speak lines ) , creates some rather comical scenes which were not at all intended to be comical . 

carole lombard ' s later great acting ability is all but unrecognizable underneath all the broad gestures , melodrama , and eager earnestness . 

mainly interesting as an historical curiosity of the period , and for it ' s completely unintended comedy-camp value .  so when bob and marion boxletter see a guy at a hotel , marion believes it is her long lost brother brian , but when she approaches him he appears to be someone else just with the exact same face . marion manages to get his fingerprints and takes it to the police and when the identity is confirmed that it was in fact her brother brian she and bob leave for new york after tracing his whereabouts . they get a hold of brian , but still he doesn ' t know what they are talking about , but all the couple really want to know is where brian has their 8 maybe 9 year old son joey . . . and even when they see joey he doesn ' t know them either . the plot thickens and they find themselves one day thinking that they are someone else as well . experiments made out on people only to make the perfect assassins yet the question of why they would bother putting bob and marion in the same building as each other is beyond me . personally gregory harrison played his 2 parts great , but i have no clue what was wrong with the other actors , they seemed bored and lost . 3 out of 10 , a little suspense yes but that ' s it .  so this is where columbia ' s head of their short subjects unit got his directorial start , eh ? yeah , it ' s none other than mr . jules white who is credited ( or is it rather , " exposed " ) as the director of this entry into mgm ' s dogville series . given co-credit as co-director is one zion myers ; whose name is heretofore unknown to us . mr . meyers was , no doubt , the guy who controlled the four-legged thespians and was responsible for training and " acting " . in short , he must have been the dog trainer on the set . 

the title of this comedy short is no doubt a play on the mgm feature of the same year , the big house ; which starred chester morris , wallace beery , robert montgomery and a stellar cast in support . we must plead ignorance in regards to this title ; not having seen it up to this point . ( sorry , schultz ! ) but there are many of the doggie gags that relate to what we ' ve read about the movie * ; not to mention some particular character specific gags . for example , we observed a canine convict who st-st-stuttered and deduced , correctly , that the bow-wow actor was mimicking character comedian , roscoe ates . we later cross-checked with the cast of the big house and presto , his name is there ! ( brilliant deduction , one fit for holmes & watson ! ) 

the practice of lampooning popular features was already a tried and true practice in the realm of the comedy short . it was one that seemed to draw no objections from the producers and copyright owners of the major films ; but rather quite contrarily received heaps of tassive approval . after all , imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery ; besides , any producer would welcome even some seemingly irreverent parodying . * * as for the movie , itself , we found it to be interesting in a sort of perverse manner . seeing so many of " man ' s best friends " being so artificially animated into one , long and boring sort of anthropomorphic gag seemed very tiring to we , who make up the audience . i mean just how many pooches were made to bark , needlessly , in order to achieve the illusion of ' talking ' ? 

when it comes to pets , or " animal companions " as the politically correct crowd prefers , we are quite eclectic ; favoring not only dogs ; but also cats , hamsters and parakeets . we don ' t enjoy seeing any animal exploited in such a non-funny , extended play format . 

as incredible as it may seem , the step that mr . jules white made from mgm ' s shorts to heading up columbia ' s 2 reeler production would seem to have been not only a $ tep up in the area of finance $ ; but al $ o in the arti $ tic content . we never thought that being producer-director for the likes of such luminaries as the 3 stooges , andy clyde and hugh herbert , as well as some who certainly had seen better days , such as charley chase , buster keaton and harry langdon ; would be a step up cinematically . 

in case we haven ' t made our point yet ; we ' re officially panning this one . so , view it at your own risk . we warned you ! 

note * we read excellent accounts of both the big house and the laurel & hardy send-up , pardon us ( hal roach / mgm , 1931 ) in both mr . laurel & mr . hardy by john mccabe ( 1962 ) and the films of laurel & hardy by william k . everson ( 1967 ) . both books have our most enthusiastic endorsement . 

note * * the prison picture became a genre of its own ; all owing a debt to the big house . in pardon us , laurel & hardy , hal roach and its director did a first class spoof , the first of many ; for a prison comedy became a required theme for so many a screen funny man to come .  writer / director brian burns has obviously seen a few romantic comedies , and he seems to think that he ' s discovered the formula for success : plenty of location shots in new york ( preferably in the winter ) , allusions to old hollywood films ( especially musicals ) , enjoyable musical soundtrack . alas , all of this is mere compensation for burns ' lack of talent as a writer . ( the great mystery of many writer-directors making independent films is not why they cannot get on with major studios , but how they get any backing at all for their films . ) 

normally our interest in romantic comedy is motivated by the lead characters , but the couple in this film simply has no appeal . this is not the fault of either david krumholtz or milla jovavich ; their characters are just poorly written . what we respond to in such classics as when harry met sally or annie hall or older films such as his girl friday are quirks and flaws of the lead characters ' personalities . lacking the ability to create individuals , burns gives us an after-school special inspired by men are from mars , women are from venus . 

how anyone can see burns as the successor to woody allen is beyond me . i did not laugh once during this film , and the screen-play is full of echo chamber dialog ( " i want to paint the town red . " " you want to paint the town red ? " ) , which is the most tell-tale sign of someone who has no business writing for a living . in one of the early scenes , we see krumholz ' s actress girlfriend filming a mindless tv sitcom . it ' s the only moment in the whole film that the dialog feels right ; maybe that indicates what burns talents are really suited for .  i sat last night to see this film being played in greek television because of the upcoming olympic games hosted by my city . knowing that it is an american film , i had already expected it to focus more on the american athletes story . and i was really ready for it . but what i saw was . . . , too much ! i mean , when a movie has such a title ( " first olympics : athens 1896 " ) , even being of american origin , you would not expect it to be so propagandizing and , on the same time , ignorant towards other countries ' athletes and efforts . the american athletes seem to have all the gifts of nature ( strength , smartness , generosity , kindness , politeness . . . ) , in contrast to their " sin-athletes " in the games , who seem being unable even to . . . speak their thoughts or express feelings . the number of times the american anthem is played during the film must be an all time record in filmography . megalomania at it ' s best ! it even uses fictionalized facts which ridicules the greek nation , such as greek citizens serving the foreign marathon athletes with wine , in order to help the domestic ones win the race . so much for the olympic spirit . 

think of it . being a greek and putting a bad mark to a movie whose title is also greek is something that doesn ' t make me happy at all . but according to what i have seen , i cannot give it more than 4 out of 10 ( being pretty generous actually ) .  rather like paul newman and steve mcqueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a " jollies " project for robert redford , as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the alpine sunshine . 

the story is as light as powdered snow with redford ' s small-town boy david chappellet ( what kind of lead name is that ? ) who with his eyes on the prize of olympic glory , gets up the nose of , in no particular order , his coach , father and team-mates . women are a mere side-show in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick-up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of , heavens above , a free-thinking , independent woman , played by camilla sparv . the ski-ing sequences are fine with some good stunt-work involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top tv coverage of skiing events down to the present day . plus i ' m not convinced that the winter olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel , i couldn ' t really be that excited for him one way or another . 

of the actors , redford , best profile forward , doesn ' t need to do much and indeed doesn ' t , while gene hackman does better with equally meagre material . ms sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats redford the way he ' s doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way . 

in truth though , there ' s a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences don ' t fully compensate and you don ' t care a fig for any of the leading characters . one of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it .  what really amazed me about this film was that it ringed so false . first of all , who in the late 80 ' s ( when the film takes place ) lived like this family ? a college professor wouldn ' t make enough money to support the lifestyle i saw on the film . hence , he and his stay home wife would be plagued by financial woes , especially when she gets cancer . second , streep is my age , and most women , particularly in her class ( educated , white , well off ) experienced the feminist movement . yet this woman seems oblivious to her anachronistic behavior . i actually felt that she was a very controlling woman who kept her husband an emotional child by taking care of his every need . 

the fact that so many people were moved by the film is amazing . i have admired carl franklin ' s films in the past , and i actually like meryl streep , but gad , what a manipulative and lying film this is .  an anonymous film which could have been directed by anyone at all . where is anthony mann , the director of such classics as " el cid " " the naked spur " or " the man from laramie " ? 

there are marvelous shots of planes in the clouds , lovingly filmed . the story is very trite , and almost completely devoid of dramatization . the couple lives an almost routine life and the user who complains about june allyson ' s choice for the wife , imho , totally misses the point . with her less-than-attractive look , her hoarse voice , she was the perfect housewife the screenplay needed . at the time , women were barefoot and pregnant : there ' s not one single woman among the base staff , even in the desk jobs - . all they had to do was worrying about their hubbies , who were fighting for democracy and against an enemy whose name we never hear , but in 1955 , it was not hard to guess it . 

one wonders why a young person who has never seen a mann movie should choose this one among all the great movies he made .  

this movie is best enjoyed amidst a large audience with the giggle-fits . 

very frequently the characters in kadosh are seen staring ahead intensely at nothing . very intense unhappy faces , very pensive , very serious . during these moments there is very serious sounding music just to make doublely sure the viewer realizes that the scene being watched is not about fun and games . 

the more entertaining portions of this film come in between the many pensive stares . we learn that the women of the kadosh community have two duties . one is to breed as many male babies as possible for their husbands . the second is to stay employed so to free their husbands from having to work . what do these men do with their ample free time ? they pray . and we learn that at home they pray out loud , " i give you thanks for not creating me as a woman . " and at their place of worship they pray to give thanks for possessing functioning male genitalia . 

along with the praying there are many scenes of frenzied antics , screaming , and endless head bobbing and bodies rocking back and fourth , and mixed in with everything are many intricate and bizarre ( or simple but just as odd ) ritualistic activities . 

the cream of the unintentional comedy comes from the sex . the imagery of an hot and bothered man actively exchanging body fluids with his wife in bed while attempting to keep his beanie from falling off his scalp is unforgettable ! 

every sex scene is funny , but one that stands out is when a husband rubs his face against his beautiful wife ' s ( yaÃ«l abecassis ) feet . oh yes , we are finally entering the land of sensuality . . . but no ! the feet rubbing stops before anything happens and the husband begins his autistic looking head bobbing and body rocking until the scene ends ! 

there are three attractive females in near states of undress , however kadosh contains absolutely no nudity . technically , there is some interesting imagery and pleasing uses of light and colors by the director . 

for a more believable , educational and entertaining treatment of the plight of being an unclean female unworthy of holding a book in a world where respect is measured by the speed by which a man can cite a phrase from ancient writings , i suggest barbra streisand ' s yentl . 

  " mr . and mrs . smith " is one of the not too well known early american hitchcock ' s movie . but if " lifeboat " ( wich unfortunately also belongs to this category ) is an underrated masterpiece , not all the movies signed by the master of suspense in that time ( the early 40 ' s ) are really worth seeing . and to tell the truth , not discovering this film isn ' t really a lost . 

 " mr . and mrs . smith " is an average and conventional screwball comedy , where it ' s rather hard to find the hitchcock ' s touch . maybe you can catch a glimpse of his shadow ( wich isn ' t much ) in the cruelty that carole lombard is sometime capable of ( but it ' s well hidden in an impersonal package ) , in a vertigo scene where two of the characters are trapped on top of a trade fair attraction , and maybe in the character of the mother . and that ' s about it ! even for the hitchcock fan , there is little to connect with . 

and for the screwball comedies amateur , there isn ' t very much more : none of the situation are exaggerated enough for being really funny , and we ' re far from the masterpieces of hawks for instance . and if one or two scene are quite amusing , there ' re not even the funniest in hitchcock ' s filmography , who created comical situations in almost all his movies ( even " psycho " could be considered full of very dark humor ) . so , there is really little to save in this movie , that can without annoying anyone ( or maybe only both hardcore fans of hitchcock and screwball comedy , who are in love with carole lombard ) , stays one of the not too well known early american hitchcock ' s movie .  in this silly symphony , a mouse from the country visits his cousin in the city . most of the short is the two mice exploring the dinner table . the animation is fine , where this short suffers is in a lack of humor . perhaps i ' ve just seen this " dinner table adventure " in one too many tom and jerry shorts . even though this came first , i just didn ' t find it that enjoyable .  this film doesn ' t have a very clear picture of what it is or wants to be . there are some good bits when stewart is on screen and they give him some lines to work with . it works best early on as romantic comedy , but the story keeps heading for more dramatic territory and gets itself lost in the process . by the last fifteen minutes or so , the plot twists are just a series dramatic clichÃ©s . 

the part with the airplane feels like some leftover footage from another film spliced in . 

the main reason i can think of to watch it is if you want be able to say you ' ve seen all of jimmy stewart ' s films .  the real problem with this story is that there ' s not much story to the story . there ' s hardly any plot to speak of . widower buys an electric grandma for his kids . one kid resists electric grandma . then finally accepts her . then the kids grow up and grandma leaves . really , very little happens . it ' s much more of a premise than a story . 

moreover , strip it of it ' s schmaltz , and you have a story that had already done before , and better : the lonely . same basic idea : person initially can ' t accept the love of a robot , because it ' s just-a-machine , then eventually yields and comes to love the robot . the biggest difference is that the lonely is much more powerful , as both the protagonist and we , the audience , are shocked abruptly back to reality and forced to remember that in the end the robot really is just a mechanism . 

i also find the story highly flawed in that the electric grandmother is just * too * perfect . she ' s not only " human " , she ' s * super-human * . she ' s * wiser * than a real person , she has no traces of mechanicalness to her at all , and she makes marbles appear out of thin air . it frankly really chafes at credulity to think that she ' s a machine .  and also a wonderful beginning , a real quick start . it keeps you yearning and waiting for is about to come . unfortunately the high adrenaline dries off quickly , but most certainly after half the movie is over . 

and it ' s a shame , because this movie has really good ideas and explores many of them thoroughly . but that is also one of it ' s faults . by exploring too many things , it get ' s mixed up into to many things , so in the end you ' re too confused to follow any plot or characters . it ' s very dark and moody , but that doesn ' t help much , if it ' s also genre hopping just to try to fit any- and everything in it ' s story !  i saw the trailers of this movie and found the cinematography and what was presented interesting . i saw the imdb rating and 6 . 8 confirmed it to be an above average movie . thus went to see it . 

the story is about mandy lane ( amber heard ) Â a beautiful girl in high school who is a subject of male sexual desire . mandy ' s friend emmet ' s ( michael welch ) provocation to another fellow student to show his love for mandy , leaves the fellow student drunk and jump down to death . nine months pass and mandy is invited for a summer weekend to a secluded ranch by her teenager friends Â three girls and three boys go there ! there is a security guard garth ( anson mount ) who works at the ranch . during the first night itself the killings take place Â one by one the members of the group are killed . who is behind the killings ? i wont tell here to spoil sports did i like the movie ? no . after usual interesting opening Â the movie takes a downward turn with every unfolding of event . by half-time when the killer is revealed , one looses all interest in the remaining proceedings . there is a last twist in the tale to shock viewers , but rather it made me shake the head in dis-belief and laugh ! all this for suspense ? huh ! amber heard acts and plays her role well as a shy and conscious girl Â who is aware of her beauty and men ' s desire for her . the remaining cast are usual Â nothing to say about . there are so many movies made of teenager boys and girls going to a secluded place and slowly someone killing them one by one Â that it does not interest me anymore . 

director jonathan levine tries hard to make the movie interesting by using contemporary chat talks of teenagers , loaded with sexual overtones , but does not allow the movie to rise above the mundane . 

the only and the most appealing saving grace of the movie is its cinematography by darren genet Â who captures beautiful picture perfect images ! ( stars 3 out of 10 )  i must admit , ashamed though i am , that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror-chiller was one of my favourite all time films . nine years after first viewing stephen king ' s frightening story however i have now come to my senses , and am able to assess fritz kiersch ' s work more reasonably . 

indeed king ' s tale of a small nebraskan farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper , but it makes for a cheap , average horror show on celluloid . a lot of this outcome can be attributed to the fact that kiersch almost allows the beginning of the film to become a hacker-slasher show , and then turns the finale into a hocus-pocus special effects nightmare . 

the cast are reasonable , but they can only portray as much credibility as this rather incredible , over the top movie will allow them , and the soundtrack by jonathan elias is spookier than the pictures . 

a real shame that george goldsmith ' s screenplay turned stephen king ' s haunting short story into a shocking horror . isaac , malachai and all the other " children of the corn " aren ' t really all that scary . 

sunday , august 7 , 1994 - video if you like bad movies ( and you must to watch this one ) here ' s a good one . not quite as funny as the first , but much lower quality . a must-see for fans of jack frost as well as anyone up for a good laugh at the writing .  one would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking naked civil servant of 30-plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision , but no . here we have a sort of biopic of one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century that itself boasts no style whatsoever . true , the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors - and handed them a chipped mug of drab gruel to work with . everything in the infrastructure of this film is wrong , starting with the script , which is another one of those tv-movie condensations of great lives wherein every other line is a " famous quote " by the subject and every other scene is an in-your-face introduction to the next pivotal character in the subject ' s life . we get swoozie kurtz as a pr maven who promotes crisp as a stateside entertainer ; denis o ' hare as the editor of a gay periodical who hires crisp as film reviewer , becomes somewhat alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of 80 ' s aids activists , and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the dying octogenarian ; jonathan tucker ( in a fine performance ) as a shy , insecure painter of gay-themed canvases who is befriended by crisp ; and finally cynthia nixon as performance artist and woman-about-bohemia penny arcade who , intrigued by crisp ' s persona , offers him a spot in her traveling cabaret act . nixon is a persuasive and gifted performer but is given no chance by the script to embody the down-to-earth and streetwise arcade . crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one-room flat in an old tenement building in manhattan ' s east village . he famously said that he never cleaned because " after a few years the dust doesn ' t get any worse , " or something like that . but looking at the depiction of that flat in this film you ' d never get the flavor of that dustiness . he frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and would be seen pretty much each day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by . in this film we get a diner that looks like something on 12th avenue by the hudson river . most of the " streets of new york " scenes have a sterile , unreal look with no sense of the period . 

the soul of this film is the great john hurt in the title role . after nearly 35 years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar post-edwardian englishman and put it across to third millennarians . his every line , every gesture is exquisite . in the later scenes he even modulates his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is winding down toward death . crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very , very old one ' s skin takes on the character of a smelly overcoat that cannot be removed and one longs for death . one senses that feeling in hurt ' s performance . so , for him and him alone this film is worth a look .  as i read the script on-line , i thought " capote " needed a trim . having just seen it on ppv , i can tell you it wasn ' t trimmed , it was butchered like that poor family ! example : in the script , truman dubs shawn " adorable one " ; here , he is " mr . shawn " . 

bad enough the amateurs behind this movie de-flame capote and bash his circle ( are we to really believe they thought so little of nelle , they mangled her little opus like an obnoxious in-joke ? ) , they turn perry smith into this oh-so-sensitive victim , even as he ' s shown dispatching the clutters . it ' s one thing to fudge the facts , it ' s another to drop the ball : the executions were carried out between 12 : 45-1 : 19 am , april 14 ; truman is shown at the prison 22 hours later ! 

i was totally underwhelmed by the " acting " . keener doesn ' t even try to sound like an alabama native . the way cooper kept shouting " alvin ! " , i was waiting for the chimpmunks to show up ! hoffman gives us not the charming gadfly , but a pathetic suck-up who sees an horrific act as his ticket to the big time . when hoffman whines about being " tortured " by the endless appeals , i wanted to give him a shotgun so he could do us both a favor and blow his brains out !  bela lugosi as god ? transvestites discussed in a movie in the straight-laced 1950s ? by golly , this must be an ed wood film . 

watching this movie , i felt a combination of guilt , pleasure , and nausea all at the same time . the story is about glen ( ed wood himself ) and his cross-dressing alter-ego glenda . somehow , if this movie were made now , i could see kevin kline playing glen / glenda . notice how all the cross-dressers ' alter egos are versions of their male name ( glen / glenda , robert / roberta , etc . ) . it attempts to sympathetically portray it as the mental disorder that it is , rather than as a graphic perversion . 

somehow , wood manages to sneak in bondage and s & m sequences into his initial story of glen / glenda . along with these racy scenes , satan himself shows up , obviously having a bad hair day . the dialog and pace are nonexistent , but the film is enjoyable in its context -- the weird world of ed wood . 

sterno says put on your favorite lace panties for this one .   " the death of a performer at a broadway stage play brings a theatre critic and a police detective together as an unlikely crime-solving duo . the dead performer ' s niece becomes not only the object of affection for our critic , but also a prime suspect in this death , and some other murders that occur at the theatre . ' the phantom killer ' sets his sights upon the young woman as his next victim ; so , it is a race against time for our heroes to catch the killer , " according to the dvd sleeve ' s synopsis . 

milton raison ' s screenplay puts a little spark in this low-budget mystery whodunit . helpfully , dave o ' brien ( as anthony " tony " woolrich ) does well in the lead role ; his skills as an actor appear to be much greater than the productions employing him . o ' brien and cab driving sidekick frank jenks ( as egbert " romeo " egglehoffer ) would have made a fine 1950s tv detective team . leading lady kay aldridge ( as claudia moore ) and the supporting cast are also good . unfortunately , the story becomes meandering , and anti-climactic . 

 * * * * the phantom of 42nd street ( 5 / 2 / 45 ) albert herman ~ dave o ' brien , kay aldridge , frank jenks carlos mencia is not funny . from his stand up specials to this train wreck of a tv series , carlos mencia is not funny . i have been trying to convince people for two years that he steals other comedians ' jokes , and as far as his comedy material goes , he is a regular " johnny-come-lately " with far less than sub-par results . psycho astronaut jokes ? britney spears breakdown jokes ? i hope this is only a scheduling error , but come on carlos and comedy central , those topics , and many others , have run the gamut of late night tv show hosts ' opening monologues , saturday night live , mad tv and many , many others . lampooning ethnic and racial stereotypes ? comedy stands no chance of evolving with carlos mencia around . perhaps people , especially viewers and comedy central executives will get the point since this week ' s issue of " new york " magazine accurately labeled him : " carlos mencia , unrepentant joke-filcher . "  this western / musical / comedy is not one of the best of the genre i have seen . i found it much too slow . it just plodded along to the inevitable end . i also found it disjointed . i couldn ' t wait for it to be over . randolph scott is the headliner here , and lloyd bridges also stars . but for my money money edgar buchanan is the best of the bunch . buchanan appeared in many westerns in his day , many times providing comic relief , as he does in this picture . i also liked ann dvorak as rita . otherwise , though , i can ' t think of much to recommend this movie . the movie is based on a novel by ernest haycock , who also wrote the novel stagecoach , which was mad into a movie of the same name in 1939 , and remade in 1966 and again in 1986 . the 1939 version of stagecoach , is in my mind , one of the best movies ever made . anyway . as for abilene town , my vote is a 3 / 10 saboteur was one of the few hitchcocks i had yet to discover and i was less than half-overwhelmed . the french title " la cinquiÃ¨me colonne " ( i . e . the fifth column , a very evocative phrase for underground spying and sabotage organizations ) set my expectations quite high as did the images of the finale on top of the statue of liberty . 

basically saboteur is as much light-hearted as were the 39 steps ( note this is another evocative phrase , even mcguffin as a title ) but it lacks most of the humor ( so the characters are rather down to earth ) and it ' s definitely not as fast paced . as a chase movie across the usa from la to ny saboteur drags its feet from sequence to sequence . the sequence at the villain ' s lovely ranch ? lovely ranch , lovely villain but pretty tame on the whole , it doesn ' t really add up to nothing . the meeting with the blind man , the mixing with circus people , the soda city sequence , the ny ball sequence ? they fall flat , bringing in more characters with very little added suspense value . 

one big problem i can point out is the relationship between the leads robert cummings and priscilla lane which is not building up as with robert donat and madeleine caroll in the 39 steps . hence the whole narrative structure is floating , depending on the addition of new scenes . and new scenes only bring us nearer the end since it ' s not clear if the hook is the hero ' s escape from the police , from the villains or his action to stop the plotted sabotages . in the 39 steps it was clearly scripted as 1 / escaping from the police ( so you know the hero can ' t just go to the police ) then 2 / running for his life and after the villains to prove his innocence . 

if you want a better hitchcock from the 40s wartime propaganda i would advise you to chose foreign correspondant over saboteur . they are both chase movies with a catchy finale , well really a gripping one and not just sightseeing in foreign correspondant as well as beautifully efficient scenes ( the umbrella crowd , the tulip fields , the strange mills . . . ) .   " the racketeer " stars carol ( deprived of the " e " that usually appeared at the end of her first name ) lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist ( roland drew ) who has since become a down-and-out alcoholic , and torn between her love for him and the interest of new york crime kingpin robert armstrong ( top-billed ) . it ' s virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies : stiff direction , immobile cameras , stagy acting and ridiculously slow-paced delivery of lines . at the time the sound crews were telling the directors to have their actors speak every line s-l-o-w-l-y and not to start speaking their own line until after the previous actor had finished theirs . done about five years later , this could have been an interesting movie , but director howard higgin faithfully follows his sound recorder ' s dictates and systematically undercuts the talents we know lombard and armstrong had from watching their later movies . " the racketeer " was made in 1929 , a year that despite the transition problems from silent to sound nonetheless gave us some legitimate masterpieces Â vidor ' s " hallelujah ! , " mamoulian ' s " applause , " wyler ' s " hell ' s heroes , " capra ' s " ladies of leisure " Â all from directors with strong enough wills to tell the soundboard dictators to get stuffed and let their actors talk and act naturalistically . too bad howard higgin wasn ' t that strong ; as it is , watching a naturally rapid-paced actor like armstrong slog through the part in the ridiculous way he ' s been told to speak , one can ' t help but wonder where that 50-foot gorilla is when armstrong needs him .  roy rogers ( as roy ) and sidekick raymond hatton ( as rusty ) join teddy roosevelt ' s " rough riders " . soon , they get suspended in order to " round-up " the killer of partner eddie acuff ( as tommy ) along the mexican-u . s . border ; they discover creepy gold runners in the process . notice how , even suspended , mr . rogers is able to get the rough riders to join in his round-up ! 

this is not one of the better roy rogers westerns . the fighting scenes look like choreographed dances . rogers sings / yodels " ridin ' down the trail " , one of two relatively ordinary songs ; and , a stand-out moment , overall . 

 * * rough riders ' round-up ( 3 / 13 / 39 ) joseph kane ~ roy rogers , raymond hatton , lynne roberts this movie was very disappointing in that several elements of the book were wrongly done . the main story is the same but there are several flaws that hurt the movie . 

1 ) boobie miles gets injured in the beginning of the story in a preseason game at texas tech . this means he won ' t get anything done during the season at all and chris comer comes up sooner on the team . 

2 ) the game against marshall was lost at marshall . the team depicted as marshall was actually midland high one of permian ' s main rivals and here is the proof- marshall high is the mavericks colored scarlet and silver , midland high is the bulldogs colored purple and gold . look at the jerseys and you will see who it is . also the real marshall high ' s football roster is overwhelmingly black , the team shown was racially mixed like midland high . 

3 ) permian only loses to midland lee by one point in district play . midland lee loses to midland high and midland high loses to permian . these are the teams that set up the coin toss as such . 

4 ) boobie comes back on the team as a reserve to chris comer and after not getting any playing time in the midland lee game , he quits the team completely at half time and never stands on the sideline or goes to any games again . 

5 ) brian chavez was a tight end and defensive end who wore # 85 not a tight end and strong safety . in addition , boobie wore # 35 and ivory christian wore # 62 . 

6 ) the coaches end up liking chris comer as a player more than boobie because he has a better lifting ethic and runs more straight up plays the way the staff prefers him too , this is in part why boobie quits the team . 

7 ) dallas carter is played in austin at darrell k . royal memorial stadium where ut plays in the state semi-finals not the state finals . carter wins the state title but is forced to forfeit due to an ineligible player . 

the acting is done pretty well but if you read the book , you will see these flaws are pretty true . i am also tired of hearing all the pc hypocrites out there complain about the depiction of dallas carter ' s football team . the team according to the book is as large , monstrous , talented , and black as the movie shows . people say it is a racist depiction but reading the book , you see a true depiction of the team . the story is very altered giving this movie a score of 3 . 5 / 10 .  salesman lenny brown ( woods ) is fast losing his knack of selling the proverbial ice cream to eskimos . given a chance to shine in california by a philanthropic entrepreneur , brown and his wife linda ( young ) live the high life off tax shelter investments ; a fortune they lose when the federal government changes the tax laws . 

seven hundred thousand dollars in the red , and in need of a ' boost ' , the yuppies without portfolio begin to hoover vast quantities of colombian marching powder up their hooters , until they find themselves with rather hungry monkeys on their back . after briefly cleaning up , linda ' s coke-induced miscarriage sees lenny once more careering like a pinball between uppers and downers . living purgatory follows . 

a contemporary take on reefer madness , with perverse echoes of albert brooks ' lost in america , the boost was overshadowed on release by tabloid revelations concerning an alleged affair between woods and young , and their tumultuous falling out . woods , then engaged to horse trainer sarah owen ( now his ex-wife ) , reputedly slapped a $ 2 million lawsuit on his spurned co-star for " emotional harassment " during filming , citing fatal attraction-style late-night phone calls to his fiancÃ©e and , in one noteworthy incident , reputedly leaving a mutilated baby doll on his and owen ' s doorstep . 

ironically , the lack of chemistry between the supposedly loving leads is one of the more depressing aspects of this latter-day exploitation flick - the only real passion woods demonstrates towards young is when he ' s kicking her around the room . the script too is hilariously dreadful , perhaps mitigating young ' s near-comatose performance when given howlers like " stay with me - ' til i fall off the earth " to emote . further , given woods ' edgy dramatic personae , his jittery descent loses all credibility when actually he looked that way to begin with . 

ultimately , the boost must be seen in context : in the 21st century cocaine use is ubiquitous . however , in 1988 , with america still embroiled in an unwinnable " war on drugs " , the very fibre of the nation looked to be in peril - hence one of the most hellish - and for that read hysterical - depictions of drug-abuse .  the preposterous premise of this flick has to do with argentina reclaiming the falkland islands , having failed through force in 1982 , by impregnating the european women inhabitants with argentinean sperm thereby diluting the ethnic purity until it favored argentina . yeah , right . the reconnaissance is done by our hero / villan and cad , fabian , who hauls his fish-eye camcorder from pillar to post secretly filming his encounters with the falklanders including his courting and eventual conquest of one woman , camilla . an unfortunate indie and fraudulent documentary , this flick favors us with lots of boring tourism shot from the hip . . . . yada , yada , yada . the film has no plot potential and only begins to become interesting as fabian and camilla wend their way through the usual moments of awkwardness and uncertainty as they get from the handshake to the bed . " f * ckland " is only for those cinema purists who can appreciate the bleak , no frills , jigglecam austerity of dogme indies .  after hoo-hooing american indians scalp number one son , frontiersman bruce bennett ( as daniel boone ) seems , at first , like he wants to get even ; but , he really wants to make friends with the natives . when sad-eyed indian chief lon chaney jr . ( as blackfish ) also loses number one son , it gets more difficult to clear up misunderstandings . apparently , this was republic pictures ' attempt to do for their " daniel boone , trail blazer " what disney studio ' s had successfully done with " davy crockett , king of the wild frontier " ( 1955 ) . 

the " dan ' l boone " song , whistled and sung by a group of children in a wagon , did not follow fess parker ' s " davy crockett " up the hit parade . singer faron young ( as faron callaway ) doesn ' t perform the title song ( perhaps wisely ) ; he does sing " long green valley " , and makes a good impression as a blond boyfriend for boone ' s daughter . but , spanish actor freddy fernandez is the film ' s most valuable player . in a cute scene , mr . fernandez reminds mr . young the name of the character ( " susannah " ) he is supposed to be in love with . 

 * * * * daniel boone , trail blazer ( 10 / 5 / 56 ) ismael rodrÃ­guez ~ bruce bennett , lon chaney jr . , faron young , freddy fernandez this movie suffers from the fact that for years hollywood had no clue as to how to package jackie chan for the masses . his low-budget hong kong movies were all fast-paced kinetic thrillers that highlight his amazing gymnastic skills and talent for light comedy . his early hollywood films stuck him in the same movies that were being packaged for stallone or chuck norris . there is nothing about chan ' s character in this movie that requires the character to be asian except for his being the star . in his hong kong films chan is never dull , with the movies being one rapid-fire martial arts sequence after another , but " the protector " is lifeless throughout . danny aiello isn ' t given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more a result of the script and direction than how the two actors got on together . both have been better in worse movies . the best thing about the movie is the hong kong settings . the worst part is the appalling way that jackie chan comes off so colorless and drab . it wouldn ' t be until the made-in-canada " rumble in the bronx " that the west would finally figure out how to make a good jackie chan movie .  this was only the second version of the classic story by charles dickens i had seen , and sadly it turned out to be one of the worst . the film opens with a quick live action piece where simon callow as charles dickens begins the story of a christmas carol , and then obviously it goes to animated story itself . you probably already know it , ebenezer scrooge is the grouchy cold-blooded businessman who refuses charity and hates christmas . he is visited by jacob marley ( nicolas cage ) who warns him of the visits of the other three ghosts of christmas past ( jane horrocks ) , present ( sir michael gambon ) and the silent future / yet to come . after all this he obviously realises the true magic of christmas , and promises to be nicer in future . the only changes i noticed to the story were scrooge having mice as friends ( a stupid idea ) , scrooge ' s ex-love belle ( kate winslet ) needing to see him to help at the orphanage , the ghost of christmas present showing the two kids , " want " and " ignorance " , scrooge still gets haunted after being turned nice , and he ' s worried he can ' t keep his promise to stay nice . also starring rhys ifans as bob cratchit , juliet stevenson as mrs . cratchit , iain jones as scrooge ' s nephew fred and colin mcfarlane as fezziwig . the animation is not great quality , the actors have wasted their voices for a worthless piece of garbage . the only good thing that comes from this film is the good voice of kate winslet , singing the closing song " what if " , as for the rest , it is just excruciatingly awful . very poor !   " dr . cameron , a discredited scientist succeeds with his experiment in creating serum the transforms men into wolf-like creatures . originally developing this formula to help the world , the scientist decides to use his newly created subject to exact revenge upon the scientists who were responsible for his ouster from the scientific community . the scientist ' s daughter lenora grows wary of her father ' s actions and shares her suspicions with a newspaper reporter . when the scientist loses control of his creature , it falls upon the scientist ' s daughter and the reporter to stop it , " according to the dvd sleeve ' s synopsis . 

mad scientist george zucco ( as lorenzo cameron ) creates his formula rather unimaginatively , by mixing human and wolf blood . this brings the beast out in hulking glenn strange ( as petro aka pedro ) , who is directed to act like lon chaney jr . in " of mice and men " . johnny downs ( as tom gregory ) and anna nagel ( as lenora cameron ) are a likable werewolf hunter and damsel in distress . certainly , " the mad monster " is no substitute for " the wolf man " ; but , it ' s a serviceable addendum . the grainy black-and-white photography enhances the foggy , cow-webbed atmosphere . " god " ( uncredited ) strikes up a well-done ending , too . like blaine ( robert strange ) said , " mingling the blood of man and beast is downright sacrilege ! " 

 * * * * the mad monster ( 1942 ) sam newfield ~ george zucco , johnny downs , anna nagel the storyline of " the stranger " mirrors somewhat the 1969 film " journey to the far side of the sun " ( made by gerry & sylvia anderson of ' thunderbirds ' and ' space : 1999 ' fame ) . a parallel-universe earth is the premise of both films . but there is a difference . where the world in " the stranger " features a totalitarian regime out to squash the freedom of the citizenry , " journey to the far side of the sun " merely showed a true mirror world where handwriting , roads , houses , machinery of every kind , and of course internal organs were all in reverse ( or mirrored ) order . so , the similarity of parallel earths is the only connection of both films . 

similarly , the tv series " land of the giants " came before both of those films , having run from 1968 to 1970 . it featured a world that was nearly parallel to the earth with the exception that the planet was populated by giants 12 times the size of the humans who crash-landed there . the idea of a totalitarian government out to capture and contain the ' little people ' was similar to the premise of " the stranger " more-so than the premise of " jttfsots " . perhaps because of the similarly to " lotg " , a series to " the stranger " was shelved . had it turned into a tv series it would have been a sci-fi version of " the fugitive , " with star glenn corbett being chased by the baddies from week to week , hiding out in different locations , etc . btw , a stronger script could have helped this film along .  surprisingly kieslowski ' s this movie is disappointing to me because of the sometimes weird and sometimes clichÃ© script that also seems a work of a poor observation sometimes . there is an isolated young boy . he lives with one of his relatives , but he is lonely and every night watches a woman who lives across their building . it seems ! that he wants her . he is one of the youths who are not good at communication with the opposite sex . however , he likes that woman , when the woman comes to his house with a man , tomek gets pain . then , we understand that kieslowski tells us a story about an isolated young boy who needs a female to flirt or who falls in love with a mature woman . he does not do something else , because may be he knows that it is his salvation . one day , he stops that woman , suddenly , he seems a shy boy , but proves that he is not , so he explains her almost everything . she lectures and refuses him . everything is so realistic like the other kieslowski films , no problem . the problems start when tomek visits her , the story of a lonely young boy who falls in love with a mature woman ( but an unrequited love ) turns into the story of a lonely young boy falls in love with a mature woman , at the beginnings the woman refuses , but after a short time , she starts to change her mind . this u-turn makes the movie clichÃ© firstly . the personality of tomek is weird ? or a result of a poor observation ? i disappointed with this character , this is my opinion and i will try to tell why . when he goes to her house , magda treats him very friendly . she asks what do you want from me ? to kiss me ? to make love with me ? to go out with me ? at this point , i remember the people who say she is a femme fatale . see ? returning to the scene , tomek rejects all the proposals . why ? because he is shy ? i don ' t think so , but his communication is blunt , ok . after the leg scene at home , some events make the movie misses its aim . i think that the aim of the movie is ( should have been according to the story ) to show us there are some people who suffer from lack of endearment and to save from this situation is not easy owing to lack of communication and being aloof especially for men . i mean that at this point , what does the movie say ? it is blurred and disappointing . it is seen that he is not hunger for love or a female or sex . then , what ? and the suicide attempt scene support this weakness . so that he touches her legs , he wants to kill himself ! by the way , as i mentioned before , some say magda is a femme fatale . totally not . she endeavors in order to make tomek happy . does she avoid having contact with him ? no . does she insult him ? no . does she amuse him ? no . and does she deceive him ? no . she has some troubles with her ( ex ) lover , so she is not o . k . however , she does not take revenge for it from tomek . she is not an angel , but not a femme fatale also .  as a fan of nearly any period drama , and at that a huge jane austen fan , i was horrified by this adaption . as a fan of the 1999 version of mansfield park , i was constantly comparing the two and this fell far short . it felt hugely rushed and very one-dimensional so that it became boring very quickly . there seemed to be no subtly to the relationships , particularly that of fanny and edmund , and little atmosphere despite being set in a beautiful location . despite having looked forward to the jane austen season since christmas i turned this off after an hour and went to bed . i will be interested to watch the adaptations of persuasion and northanger abbey , of which i have no much-loved version , to see if they still manage to bore me in such a manner .  truly i love lucy as well . . . comedic genius yes . . . . . mame . . . never . . . she was as ridiculous as mame . . . as was the film adaptation of divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood . both just completely missed the point . roslind russell was , is and always will be the first and only mame . perhaps as a young starlet , ball could have pulled off a role like this , where her inherent beauty and youth could have carried her through . . . but this seemed a desperate attempt from an aged star to show that she was still viable in the field . the reason there are sooo many more supporters of russell ' s version ( aside from the fact that you cant improve upon the original ) is that russell had presence , she absorbs every scene , whereas lucille ball might as well be a pattern on the wallpaper in mame for all the attention she commands in the role .  first off , i ' m in the u . s . 

when i first saw this , i thought it was an obvious - and loathsome - rip off of " the office " ( uk ) . i would have thus awarded it zero stars , but lo and behold , it came out long before the ricky gervais series . 

still , it ' s hard to watch this or any other show with a similar dynamic ( including the american " office " ) without comparison . it just isn ' t even close to being the same thing . 

i will give it some credit for being original , and ahead of its time . i ' ll also say that it - and the u . s . " office " and " larry sanders " - are actual satires . the uk " office " is something grander and more transcendent , as if populated with real people in events that felt like they actually happened . however , unlike this or the shrill christopher guest " mockumentaries " , it isn ' t really a satire , while " the newsroom " definitely is . 

be that as it may , " the newsroom " still isn ' t very funny . it ' s aloof , and self-aware , but with a cast and crew not nearly smart or talented enough to heft the goods . it ' s weighty comedy being carried on weak shoulders . commendable , but ultimately not recommended . 

--- and what ' s with the lack of an anamorphic dvd ? ! i know it was shot in anamorphic widescreen , because i saw the pilot episode on one of our hd channels . cbc , get with the programme . ; )  this movie has lots of action and little heart . let ' s forget for a minute that it gets just about every aspect of the russian revolution wrong - after all we only have only under an hour here to tell our story . in fact , the czar abdicated after world war i proved a disaster for the country , and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the leninists took power nine months later , mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw russia from the war . now , back to our story . 

here we have the revolution being " rumored " in russian newspapers in what appears to still be a functioning country until violence erupts suddenly and upends the life of nobleman baron nikita ' nikki ' krasnoff ( douglas fairbanks jr . ) . he flees his home with his former servant girl tanyusha ( nancy carroll ) in tow , and they start to make a new life in constantinople . before the revolution the baron made a regular habit out of making a play for the girl , not out of any real passion , but out of boredom as a diversion of sorts . the revolution doesn ' t change this , and he continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl . it certainly doesn ' t make the audience like this guy to see him toying with her so . tanyusha follows the baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the baron ' s home , and she has known no other life other than waiting on nikki hand and foot . once in constantinople , nikki quickly wearies of life as a penniless laborer , and that is when he meets up with his former lover , russian aristocrat vera zimina , who has a plan for getting them to paris where the tsarists have congregated after the revolution . unfortunately for tanyusha , vera ' s plan does not include her . 

this film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of early talkie actress nancy carroll . she does a good job with what little she is given to do , but that is not much . lilyan tashman is the standout here , even though she has only a small role as russian vamp vera . lilyan was so often given supporting roles just as she is here , but her earthy voice and glamorous looks make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears . guy kibbee even shows up in a humorous bit as an american tourist who is curious about the russian royalty that has been forcefully ejected from their homeland .  if you live in the suburbs , are relatively well off financially , and do not really have much contact with the city life of england , then this is the comedy for you . not something a mass audience would go for , but if you ' re like these characters they show you ' ll love it to pieces . overall this is a comedy that the snobs at the bbc will sit back and laugh at for their pleasure and only a select few of the publics . comparing it to bbc comedys like only fools and horses , fawlty towers , black adder , and other classics , this series tends to drift away from the bbc ' s regular product to the audience and deliver to somewhat of a folk culture .  to remake " lost horizon " , as a musical , the need for a rodgers & hammerstein or lerner & lowe type musical composition was needed . burt bacharach and hal david were the wrong choice . having said that , my favorite thing about " lost horizon " , is its score . it ' s just that the score doesn ' t fit the piece . the cast , is made-up of mostly non-musical talents ( ullman , finch and hussey , were all dubbed , and still don ' t sound all that great ) . 

frankly , the novella , on which this , and the earlier non-musical film versions were based , is mediocre , at best . while the possibilities for a truly good , cinematic musical version exist , they are not realized here . the film succeeds at being a good , rainy-day vehicle , to pass the time . otherwise , you are better off , buying the cd of its soundtrack . only recommended as a curiosity piece , due to the film ' s awful reputation . i ' ve seen much better ; but i ' ve seen much worse .  paranoid park is about alex , a 16 year old skater who causes the death even if accidentally of a security guard . as the movie goes on alex deals with little issues like his parent ' s divorce and the sexual heat of his girlfriend jennifer ( played by taylor momsen who you can currently see in gossip girl ) while he ' s consumed by guilt . i had seen just one movie by gus van sant so far , elephant , and i can assure you that he kept all his mannerisms while doing this one . once again he crosses time lines . once again he uses weird filming techniques like the never-ending shots of people walking . . . maybe you like these filming techniques , i know i don ' t . the plot feels unsatisfactory to me . . . its almost to simple to be explored for such a long time . the feeling i get ( same with elephant ) is that gus van sant tries too hard to make an " artistic " movie which causes the movie itself to loose substance . also gabe nevins was pretty bad as alex , there ' s a difference between looking alienated or detached and looking like a robot . if you ' re a fan of mr . van sant then watch this , otherwise skip it . 

3 / 10 joseph conrad ' s novel , heart of darkness is a dark , profound , and lasting novel that portrays the futility and irony taking place in africa . if you are looking for a great book to read over the weekend this is not the book for you . conrad holds nothing back when describing 19th century imperialism , but the novel is meaningless without giving it the reflection and consideration it deserves . if i read this novel looking for a great adventure story i would say that i wasted my time , but looking at in the perspective of explaining the futility of 19th century civilization , i would say this is one of the most significant novels i have ever read . because of the fact that i read this novel in my english class , and we analyzed every page , i think i appreciated the book more than someone would who was just reading it for entertainment . i am not going to lie , this book was difficult and it challenges the reader to dig deep into this novel to find the true meaning . the movie on the other hand i found tiresome and boring . the movie , " heart of darkness " comes no where near giving the book justice . the movie left out many key parts that i consider important to get the true message of the story . if you are having difficulty understanding and visualizing the novel then the movie might be a good recourse but i would not recommend seeing the movie as an alternative to the novel or even a different perspective .  i saw recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival and i can ' t believe that this is sweden ' s official submission to the 79th academy awards to be considered for best foreign film . producer anna anthony last year also had sweden ' s official submission for best foreign film with zozo . i wasn ' t personally a fan of zozo but at least it had some production value to it . this could have been shot as a high school film project . as a short film it may have worked but as a feature film it is as lost as it ' s characters . this is a story about five twenty something friends who live in a small swedish town and have no goals or hopes or ambitions for the future and like to live in the past of their long gone childhood . actually falkenberg isn ' t like some remote northern swedish village . it ' s a popular summer resort with a population of city and townships of almost 40 , 000 and lies between two major southern coastal swedish cities of gÃ¶tborg and malmo . the characters are likable enough guys but if they were high school age kids with a bleak or confused attitude about what they plan to do with their lives i would undoubtedly care about them more . they are however long past the point where they should be making plans to deal with adulthood . if they want to stay in falkenberg forever than certainly there must be some jobs in the tourist or fishing industry instead of just riding bicycles , drinking , smoking pot and occasionally painting a house . maybe if they hung around with a girl or two in their circle of friends , of which girls are absent from this film altogether which doesn ' t make sense . jesper ganslandt makes his directorial debut and co wrote the film along with the cinematographer , of which i use the term loosely , fredrik wenzel . the acting isn ' t too bad . i would give this a 4 . 5 out of 10 but despite it ' s submission for consideration for the academy awards i would not recommend it .  audrey , i know you truly cherish your husband ted ' s memory but please do his legacy justice and heed his wishes . dr . seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason . we beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories , images , fantasies and characters . they are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of hollywood and broadway . the children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books . 

it is indeed your property to do with as you wish . i just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while . save what is left of dr . seuss . thank you .  while there is a lot to recommend about maetel legend both in concept and finished product , it ' s ultimately a poor film . plot wise it ' s a retelling of maetel ' s early life , which is usually unclear ; at the same time the writers take the opportunity to tell the story of the machine empire . and since leiji matsumoto has trouble not including his other work we get a starting point for emeraldas her sister , her mother : the queen of la metalle and a bit of galaxy express 999 to flesh out the film . 

in short maetel is a princess on the planet la metalle , a planet with an irregular orbit , thus meaning its cycle around the nearest sun is reaching a cold stage and it ' s artificial sun is dying . the planet grows increasingly colder throughout the story , thus increasing the sense of doom . in order to protect her subjects and family the queen decides that mechanisation is the only way to ensure survival of la metalle ' s people . enter lord hardgear , a robot / cyborg who provides the means for the job . through the film , the characters are left to question mechanisation , will they still be human ? can hardgear be trusted ? do souls and hearts remain ? so for a fan of matsumoto ' s work , there ' s lots to enjoy , questions to be answered , themes continued , except it ' s obvious that the film is meant to be an introduction , as well as a fan curiosity . the negatives , foremost the animation , while galaxy express 999 , a tv series from over 20 years ago has shoddy mouth animation and at times sketchy character design , maetel legend has all the worst traits of modern animation and thus earns an air of respectability to galaxy express 999 . the design is well detailed but unfortunately the animation has suffered leaving well drawn characters that ' slide ' , as in the backgrounds move or the camera zooms , a quick way of animating . however the few , yes few well animated scenes are re used over and over in dream sequences , repetition and in extra scenes . anyone who ' s seem the film will wonder how many times lord hardgear can drink the same glass of wine . 

next the story , while in concept everything sounds great , the finished product is in fact a series of conversations of plot which are repeated over and over to little effect , the number of times the characters encounter the same problems and learn the same things is practically insulting to the audience and the characters , which are seemingly much more articulate in former incarnations . add to all of that some terrible character design , that seem lifeless , over exaggerated , and the audience is left with a movie so miss handled it might as well have been rewritten as a different film , at least the newcomers wouldn ' t be left baffled . 

and yet , it really has its moments , the ending at least is surprising . the plight of the citizens of la metalle was quite affecting and rightly disturbing ; i guess i find that whole man-machine theme distressing . it ' s hard know who to recommend maetel legend to , since it ' s not well animated , written or executed , plus confusing once leiji matsumoto ' s mandatory cross-referencing is introduced . however i can ' t help but brighten up when the magnificent entrance of three-nine occurs , now that ' s good cinema . 

1 / 5 stars out of 5 , 2 if you ' re a fan .  i was rather disappointed . the first tetsuo made me an instant tsukamoto fan , from the first 5 mins of the film . it was fresh , innovative , and just . . . . . different . i rather enjoy having a movie be in your face and push all those " make you squirm " buttons . tetsuo did just that where for me , few movies can . 

for those of us who enjoy getting a breath of fresh air , those that appreciate those offbeat styles used that make indie films so worthwhile , testuo ii will likely be a disspointment . if your looking for that visceral " hyper-kinetic " feel of the first movie , skip this one , as thats all been stripped away . tetsuo ii is for some odd reason , just a typical hollywood style action flick . i was rather confused . however , it ' s still worthwhile in my opinion for any die-hard tsukamoto fan .  the main portion of this lightweight musical story is located at fictional midwick college , which peter kendricks ( peter lind hayes ) attends due to the largesse of stage actress grace hayes , his real-life mother who fills the same role here , and who manages to supply his love interest through her secretary mary ( healy ) who is his real-life wife . drably directed from a weak script , and additionally hampered by excessive cutting and poor editing , this film does provide some treasures among its eight songs , including the title number , and has nice turns by soprano healy , benny rubin as a snack shop proprietor , and the dynamic tap dancing roland dupree .  produced at a point in his career , where he had the juice to do whatever he wanted , eddie murphy took on the task of producing , directing , co-writing and starring in harlem nights , an expensive-looking but ultimately empty gangster saga about a group of black nightclub owners / gangsters running a ritzy club during the 1930 ' s , headed by a wisecracking hot shot ( eddie murphy ) and his adopted father ( richard pryor ) and their attempts to avoid being overrun by white gangsters who think they are taking over turf that , it seems , they think is rightfully theirs , simply by virtue of their color . this was an idea that probably looked great on paper but it definitely lost something in the translation . this was a vanity piece for eddie and i think he spreads himself a little too thin here trying to be the whole show here . admittedly , it was a pleasure seeing murphy and pryor together on screen , but the rest of the large supporting cast , including arsenio hall , redd foxx , della reese , michael lerner , danny aiello , jasmine guy , thomas mikal ford , stan shaw , and eddie ' s brother , are really given precious little to do ( though i will admit murphy ' s fight scene with della reese is hysterically funny and probably , the movie ' s best scene ) . murphy clearly poured a lot of money into this film and a good deal of it shows on screen . the art and set direction are impressive and the breathtaking costumes should have won an oscar , but this one was a big miss for eddie as he definitely tried to wear too many hats .  i watched this last night on sundance . altman must be the most hit or miss director of note ever . this show , despite its " star power " is utterly non-compelling , and its political insights--which i as a proud liberal in no way disagree with--are shallow and clunky , and seem ripped from the headlines of usa today , despite the fact it ' s coming out of the mouth of someone as esteemed as mario cuomo . the drama , as such , is not very dramatic , and the comedy is not funny . the only points of interest , really , are seeing how new yorkers live their lives , and the loyalty of a cast and crew to reassemble a show that keeps insisting has some cult following from 1988 . sometimes it seems like altman ' s sole contribution to cinema has been the art of having all your actors talk at once , the effect of which is one feels depressingly like they ' re a stranger at a wedding .  additionally titled burning man and flash fire for its various releases , this australian made film , shot in new south wales is problematic for its producers from its outset due to several personality conflicts and extended shooting time that prematurely uses up its allocated budget , and although the storyline is at times nicely detailed , below standard post-production finishing and overmuch cutting jettisons the affair . tom skerritt plays as howard anderson , an american entrepreneur with a " passion for building " who is in process of erecting a tourist hotel in the blue mountains region , all the while unaware that his business partner , julian fane ( guy doleman ) has insured the incomplete structure for ten million dollars , far more than its actual worth , and plans its destruction as corollary to normal summer brush fires in order to collect a handsome sum through fraud . in line with this illicit scheme , fane arranges for an arsonist to perform the incendiary deed , a young man who also happens to be the boyfriend of anderson ' s daughter , and due to the future resort ' s being in the midst of a critical fire hazard sector ( one of the many unexplained elements of the screenplay ) julian has every expectation that his dastardly design will come about without serious hindrance . as the local insurance firm victimized by the crime is majority owned by fane , the policy ' s naturally skeptical underwriters , lloyd ' s of london , deploy senior investigator george engels ( james mason ) to probe into the nature of the felony , made more sinister because of the death , possibly a homicide , of an insurance investigator ( wendy hughes ) who , in following clues was apparently coming close to the cause of the arson . the setting for the film is the week before christmas , capstone of summer in the antipodes , a dramatic background , but the links within the story are not smoothly compounded , resulting in the presentation of events that are rather difficult for a viewer to follow , a problem heightened by erratic editing , the mentioned heavy cutting , and poor sound and picture quality . skerritt ' s semi-comatose and droning style is fatally invalidated by this dim sound processing but mason is very effective , as ever , and enjoys the best dialogue with hughes impressive as the too early written-out investigator ; doleman wins acting laurels with his performance as the malevolent julian fane .  the tender hook , or , who killed the australian film industry ? case no . 278 . this sorry excuse for a period drama takes a cast and idea with potential Â rose byrne , pia miranda , hugo weaving , in a jazz-era gangster drama Â and turns it into a sloppily paced and executed soporific . mcheath ( weaving ) is a boxing promoter and gangster and functioning illiterate ; for no apparent reason he ' s given to singing bob dylan and leonard cohen songs before bouts . how post-modern . how stupid . anyway . there ' s a boxer , art ( matthew le nevez ) , who becomes mcheath ' s latest protÃ©gÃ© , over his unfortunately aboriginal stablemate alby ( luke carroll ) . 

mcheath ' s flapper moll iris ( byrne ) makes the goo-goo eyes at him . sexual tension squelches under the surface . miranda plays daisy , a friend of iris ' s ( these flower girls stick together ) who keeps turning up in scenes unannounced . they practice dancing together and talk about " hooking up " with guys . in the 1920s . i stopped counting anachronisms after that . there ' s a subplot involving japanese beer and a backstory of broome pearl fishermen . i don ' t know what it was all about . for some reason that is not exactly ( at all ) explained , byrne puts cocaine in art ' s lemonade . mcheath thinks he ' s a drunk and sacks him . byrne plots and schemes to help him out again . she ' s a big one for the plotting and scheming . most of which causes trouble . mcheath ' s two gunsels , portly ronnie ( john batchelor ) and russian donnie ( tyler coppin ) , debate bumping off mcheath when he realises their part in one of iris ' s schemes , but ronnie wimps out when he sees mcheath crying . a lot of practically incoherent scenes get in the road of the film finally ending . 

director jonathan ogilvie spends a lot of time working with cinematographer geoffrey simpson creating some pretty images , but utterly fails to generate a sense of style , which might have compensated for and decorated the wispy , pathetically underpowered script ; unfortunately ogilvie ' s sense of film grammar , the lack of structuring of the scenes and exposition , is stunningly incompetent . in an early scene , daisy suddenly appears in the car with the protagonists . how she got there , and indeed who she is , seems to have slipped ogilvie ' s mind . there are many more examples of this sloppiness . where he chases poetic sparseness , he achieves only wan irritation . he gains awkward performances from actors who are normally reliable , badly miscasting weaving and leaning on byrne ' s ability to project a kind of haunted doll-like humanity whilst saddling her with an incomprehensible character . 

it might not matter so much if the story had more substantial characters and stronger plotting preferably not stolen from a dozen old noir films and festooned with witlessly sprinkled pop-culture quotes . but it doesn ' t . it ' s boring .  orson welles ' 1974 documentary " f for fake " examines trickery and fraud , mainly focusing on two men who have been exposed as frauds themselves . clifford irving is a biographer who wrote the allegedly fraudulent howard hughes autobiography , yet , at least it seems , purports his innocence . the other main subject of the film is artist elmyr de hory , a man who has spent his life painting fakes of famous masterpieces , sometimes selling them to museums as real works by the original artists . interspersed among these stories are bits where welles does magic tricks to illustrate points , etc . , and he also addresses the fact that his career began as a fraud when he first lied on his resume and then created a radio sensation with " war of the worlds " . 

i really wanted to love this film and find it profound since i am such a welles devotee , but i couldn ' t bring myself to do it . part of the problem lied with the fact that it was not just non-linear , it was completely scattered . while i appreciate stylish editing and quick jumps and zooms , particularly when used in an unusual format such as a documentary , there was simply too much of it going on in " f for fake " . they created a distraction as opposed to lending style . if the story had been more clear and comprehensive , i think that the editing probably would not have been as annoying . the scattered storytelling was made all the more obnoxious by the fact that these were truly interesting subjects , particularly elmyr de hory . his artistic fakery brings up the topic of fraud in the art world , and who is truly able to determine the authenticity of certain works ; and if the works are not authentic , what does it say about those who admire the pieces in museums ? this is one documentary that i would say to at least give a shot , but don ' t be afraid to turn it off if you ' re not enjoying it . it is certainly the most discombobulated documentary i have ever seen ; it is a cross between a documentary , an art film and experimental film , none of which is properly represented or isolated . i don ' t have any lesser opinion of welles after seeing it , but it certainly , in my opinion , doesn ' t stand out as a glowing specimen in his oeuvre . 4 / 10 --shelly maybe if you ' ve never read any english literature or only ever watched the hollywood version of any book you might find merit in this awful film . it has the directorial and scripting skill of shoreditch . the bbc 1995 adaptation is both very enjoyable and close to the book and captures the atmosphere between elisabeth and darcy very well . 

the characters in this production are badly miscast , sutherland as bennet seems a total buffoon . bingley likewise acts the fool and it is imcomrepnsible that he my be a friend of darcy . i can ' t imagine how judi dench could have accepted the role , maybe she thought it was a surreal comedy version . 

quotes from the book are thrown in out of context . huge chunks are missing , the important episode with wickham is glossed over . 

mr collins is however very good , and towers above the other members of the cast . 

the only good thing is we didn ' t pay to see it . wait for the dvd and use to keep a table from wobbling .  this film makes about as much sense as an ' ozzie & harriet ' or a ' father knows best ' episode . an old copy of reader ' s digest ( circa 1962 ) would provide more insight into modern life , or the relationship between a father and a daughter , than this weird concoction . 

i was surprised with diane keaton . she appears to sleepwalk through the film . ( given the film ' s title , i realize that hers was a supporting role but even martin short managed a distinct , supporting character . ) 

i can understand the attraction of an imaginary world created in a good romantic comedy . but this film is the prozac version of an imaginary world . i ' m frightened to consider that anyone could enjoy it even as pure fantasy .  this absurd movie was about a " goodie-two-shoe , " teen-girl that really wanted to be valedictorian but finds her obstacle in a teacher name mrs . tingle . katie holmes , who plays this " goodie-two-shoe , " is faced with " the biggest dilemma of her teenage life " when this classmate guy of hers comes along with the final exams sample that should help them nail mrs . tingle ' s test . mrs . tingle comes along , catches holmes , the classmate guy and her best friend with the sample of her final exam . convinced that the three of them planned on cheating on here exam , mrs . tingle enthuses on her opportunity to ruin holmes once and for all with allegations that can take away any chance of holmes passing her class . and the classmate guy , who apparently has his eye on holmes , always wondered why she never gave him the time of day ( he ' s an idiot ) ? feeling desperate , holmes and her friends visit mrs . tingle in the middle of the night to try to dissuade her in believing that holmes was planning to cheat . it all backs fire somehow when the classmate guy points a bow and arrow at mrs . tingle , threatening her to make things right for holmes . mrs . tingle fights back but ultimately ends up as holmes and her friend ' s captive . 

during mrs . tingle captivity under holmes , they do everything from tying her up and gagging her in her own bed to blackmailing her with false pictures that they took of the unconscious coach in bed with mrs . tingle . i found myself cringing when the kids were making themselves at home in mrs . tingle ' s house , eating up her food and going though her private work . at one point , holmes found mrs . tingle ' s grade book and purposely changes the grade in her favor , decreasing the grade of her challenge for valedictorian . the end played out like a childish attempt to bring back the comedy that was sparingly in the beginning of the film , resolving on pure irony , slapstick and absurdity . 

this has to be the most unlikable and wickedly evil character holmes would ever play in her entire life . i wanted to help mrs . tingle get free to really dig a grave for holmes . she was manipulative , selfish and conniving . she even slept with the classmate guy despite her best friend ' s overwhelming interest in him . . . and she didn ' t like him . from attempting to ruin her challengers grades by seizing mrs . tingle ' s grade book to taking her best friend ' s man , you would think that holmes would get what she deserves in the end , right ? unfortunately , she obtains everything her heart desires , showing that being wicked , manipulative , selfish and whining can get you what you want . 

mrs . tingle was suppose to be the character you didn ' t like . they didn ' t bring me to that point once to believe that she was this woman that needed to be " taught this lesson . " she was like every other strict teacher who even gave valid reasons for her resentment of the next generation . personally , i felt that her opinions about young people were validated with holmes and her friend ' s actions every time . i kept hoping she could get free to call the police and nail holmes . they kept her tied up in bed , ate up her food like a bunch of pigs , drank up the woman ' s wine , messed with her personal belongings and we ' re suppose to believe that she didn ' t deserve to take a bat to each of their heads ? and the classmate guy has to be one of the most disliked characters in the history of film . forget idiot , we need a new word for him that isn ' t in the webster ' s dictionary . he brought the major trouble into holme ' s life then made things worse when he came into mrs . tingle ' s house , uninvited behind holmes , and corners mrs . tingle with a bow and arrow . i was thrilled every time mrs . tingle had a chance to slap fire out of him , or choke the wannabe actress best friend . 

if you ' re a teen out there and want to see when a teen ' s manipulation and wrong doing can get him or her the world , see this unfunny , caricature filled , unintentional film noir .  officially the first martial arts movie in ussr cinematography featuring actual martial artists like tadeush kas ' yanov and russian bruce lee - talgat nigmatullin . bad people highjack a ship in the high seas but fortunately just about everybody on board is a trained martial artist . a collectible for martial arts aficionado .  mild spoiler in the second paragraph . 

anna christie was garbo ' s lackluster 1st talkie . she and dressler look like the only people who know what they ' re doing in this movie . the old guy who plays garbo ' s dad ( george f . marion ) in the film is soooo ah-noying ! ! all he does is stumble around drunkenly in a totally fake way and yell about " dat old dah-veel sea " . he blames garbo ' s " past " , his whole life , and everything on the sea ! he comes across as stupid x 10 . charles bickford is matt , the rough ' n ' tumble sailor garbo falls in love with , and he ' s fine in his role , but nothing really outstanding . 

the best part is when garbo unleashes her " terrible secret " on bickford and her dad . finally , marion stops talking about the evil of the sea and beats his head and fists on the table in perfect time with bickford . then soon he goes on a tirade about the sea . 

i had to practically force myself to finish anna christie . it ' s too melodramatic in many parts and creaky . there are many good early talkies but this is not one of them . if you haven ' t seen garbo before try something else before anna christie , like camille or grand hotel .  in thailand , the americans connor ( colin egglesfield ) and his girlfriend amanda ( meredith monroe ) quarrel in a muay-thai fight , and amanda leaves connor alone . she asks the direction of the hotel to a stranger , indeed the mean vampire niran ( don hetrakul ) , and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil vampires in motorcycles . connor joins to a clan of " good " vampires leaded by sang ( stephanie chao ) , trying to save amanda from the claws of niran . 

i expected that " vampires : the turning " were a good movie . the locations and the cinematography are beautiful ; the very heavy music score is excellent ; stephanie chao is gorgeous and attractive ; but unfortunately , the screenplay and the director are terrible and the very loose costume of meredith monroe does not help her fallen breasts . the story is very short , and the unknown marty weiss uses long scenes with motorcycle race , fights and boring flashbacks to complete a minimum running time for film . my vote is four . 

title ( brazil ) : " vampiros : a conversÃ£o " ( " vampires : the conversion " )  is it just me or are most of the actors in this adaptation miscast age-wise ? 

jemma redgrave , although a superior actress , seems as if she should be joining her children instead of nodding off on the couch . ( i would have loved to see brenda blethlyn in the part , her connection to the latest pride and prejudice notwithstanding . ) 

blake ritson and rory kinnear were the only two whom i felt lived up to their characters in spirit and performance . every else looked confused or out of place . 

luckily , i ' m not very familiar with dr . who ( i ' ve only seen a few episodes so far ) or it would have definitely soured this further . 

too bad mansfield park has not yet seen its due on screen ( either large or small ) . this novel requires the talent of a robert altman to balance all the complexities of the characters successfully .  a few yrs ago , i remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned rosalind russell . this theorist wrote that the ' strength ' of the ' strong women ' that rozzie r . played lay partly in their ability to stand by their man ( even when he wasn ' t worth it ) . 

i thought of this essay after watching ' crimes of passion ' . 

kathleen turner exudes the same strength and style as russell in her portrayal of prostitute china blue . she ' s the object of affection for two men : the loony priest played by anthony perkins , and a bland whitebread boy who ' s marriage is slowly fading . and she won ' t let either of them have a piece of her until . . . 

i won ' t give away the ending - but i will say that this is ultimately bland whitebread boy ' s fantasy . no matter how hard ken russell tries , he can ' t disguise the fact that this movie is basically a 1940s melodrama for the mtv generation . except its retrogressive class and gender politics make those old black-and-white films look revolutionary by comparison .  what were they thinking when they made this truly terrible film ? 

arbus , one of the most important photographers and women of the twentieth century , had a fascinating and dramatic life . what possessed anyone to make this film , which explains her unique artistic vision , as being the result of an ( imaginary ) affair with a grotesque , yet charismatic hairy freak ( played by downey ) ? 

in real life , arbus broke out of a traditional marriage and woman ' s role to express herself . in this movie , arbus is an ultra-dreary nicole kidman whose inspiration is all attributed to a " beauty and the beast " devotion to an interesting man . 

for this reinvention , the film is truly shameful . independent of that , it is also just dopey and dull .  i used to love the muppets . the muppet movie , the great muppet caper and the muppets take manhattan were good family movies , cleverly written and fun to watch . i never thought i would see the day when they would jump on the hollywood sleaze bandwagon , but here it is : scooter as a caged rave dancer , pepe making lewd and suggestive comments every five minutes -- this is not your father ' s muppets . it ' s not jim henson ' s muppets anymore , either . 

this " it ' s a wonderful life " themed movie has its moments , but not enough to save it . i cringed while watching this with my children . i still have hope for their next movie , but this one was certainly a disappointment .   ' helen of troy ' follows the story of helen and the outbreak of the trojan war . this is more of a love story between helen and paris , who is shipwrecked and falls in love with helen without knowing she is queen . the film portrays the couple as lovesick and wanting nothing more than to be together . ( other films and books have different portrayals of the characters , but in this one , they are simply hopelessly in love . ) the film is pretty slow-moving in some places , but the battles and the detail to the scenery are done pretty well . there are also some good performances . i thought that the slave girl did a particularly good job , and she was one of the most well-liked characters . 

overall , this is a good adaption if you can look beyond the slow-moving story in places and look beyond some of the cheesy romance and dialogue . in my opinion , a perfect iliad film version has not yet been created , but this one is entertaining and does have some good bits .  this story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young woman that they met 50 years ago . after all this time , the young woman returns to seek revenge on the men . this story occasionally made me nod off during the movie in the middle of tiring elevator music and the ever so consistent thunder storms . but it is well worth the wait in the end when we find out just who the mystery woman is that keeps plaguing the old men in their dreams and interfering in a young man ' s life . the most of what i liked in this film was the suspense in which the young woman appears to the men just before their deaths . the special effects were something . every time i heard her call out to them i would think " not that face again . " but it was a good movie , i just wish that the pace was not as slow or the acting not as tiresome . and what i also liked about the movie was the flashback of the 20 ' s , very authentic as well as the costumes being original .  wealthy businessman ' s daughter , who as a young girl caught rheumatic fever and now suffers from a shortness of breath , discovers her marriage to a charming ne ' er-do-well was arranged by daddy ( whom she affectionately refers to as " darling " ) ; worse than that , she may in fact have only a few weeks left to live , leaving her husband free to marry her conniving romantic-rival . pure bunk . paul osborn ' s screenplay ( via jerome weidman ' s thin story ) trots out the redundant flashbacks in the second-half instead of proceeding ahead with the plot , which submerges the already-soapy scenario in grim talk . why go backwards when we can figure out what ' s happening for ourselves ? this is a " woman ' s weeper " with no faith in its target audience , so simplistic is the set-up . dorothy mcguire , swathed in furs for most of the picture , isn ' t a canny , clever heroine at all ; when she ' s upset , she turns inward and stony . upon realizing her marriage is basically a sham , she shrinks away from her husband like the consummate virgin ( well , that ' s a possibility , she and van johnson sleep in separate beds after all ! ) . ruth roman has the film ' s best moments as a society shark with her trap set for van , but what exactly do these women see in him ? johnson can be charming when it ' s required , but put him in a melodramatic setting and he goes stony , too . mgm production values only so-so , however director gottfried reinhardt tries adding some visual flavor to the flashback segues and he attempts a lively pacing for the movie ' s initial half-hour . * * from * * * *  the recent documentary " the adventures of errol flynn " is an in-depth look at the ultimate hollywood hero . bogart , cagney , wayne and the like were basically blue collar types in their screen images but flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner , the younger son out to carve out his own fiefdom for a sword , thunder and romance analogy that ironically he found himself trapped in . if he hadn ' t been under contract to warner bros . he would ' ve of been perfect in the cary grant role in suspicion : the good looking charmer whose 1000 watt smile blinds one to the fact that he ' s a predator . and he could ' ve starred with his best leading ladies sister joan fontaine . that was flynn ' s trouble he was the ultimate screen hero until his own habits and bad timing caught up with him . grant and flynn in a way are similar but flynn was the more macho of the two ; it is possible to see grant as captain blood but flynn in the philadelphia story mr . blanding builds his dream house , or monkey business , or operation petticoat would ' ve turned those roles on their collective ears because he ' s too damn sure on his feet and the sexual tension he would ' ve brought naturally would ' ve made the story lines wobbly . but this wobbly biography is just a plasticized view of flynn and his era . there are times when i half expected a laugh track or an audience to go " ahhh " at some point . it doesn ' t go deeply into flynn ' s life just the screen magazine view . it also doesn ' t delve into his struggle to be considered more than a derring-doer . like the cleaned up biographies of lon chaney ( the father , not the wolfman , or lenny " of mice and men ) and buster keaton done in the ' 50 ' s this is just a time killing piece of fluff i just recently viewed shame which is directed by ingmar bergman . the film was interesting and very unique . i liked how it was in swedish with english subtitles and that it was also in black and white . these features allowed me to better relate to the characters , the time period , and their stories . i didn ' t like how the movie was very slow in the beginning and how you didn ' t know what was really going on . at first , it was mainly a story of eva and jan ' s relationship . the movie also ended on a very depressing note because nothing good came out of all of the conflicts and changes throughout the movie . i probably would not go see shame again , but it was a very cultured experience .  on paper this movie has some chops : a street kid overcoming past trauma , rebuilding his life and succeeding when the world would have written him off . great stuff , everyone loves a happy ending . 

in the theater though , there were some omissions that left the movie dead inside . the dialog was hollow and uninteresting , the characters were almost cartoonish in their lack of dimension and complexity , and why did everyone need to be gay ? i have nothing against homosexual themes or characters in a movie but when it ' s used in this fashion not only is is offensive to homosexuals , it trivializes the lifestyle and cheapens the movie . if the story works without this cheap trick it should have been cut . 

every character seemed to come out of the same cookie cutter form : each had one major flaw and one minor flaw , every character is good hearted were they succeed or not , and everyone one of them had or is in an abusive relationship with someone . 

the most annoying fact of the movie is that they never let you get over that the name " pip " comes from great expectations . they give it to you once and that should be enough . the story shares enough with the dickens classic to make this fact obvious . 

the most interesting part of the film is the story of the grandfather and the cassette he leaves for pip and how pip , the main character , learns how to grow up from the lessons learned from the tape . in the end , with lessons learned , pip confronts his dark past and movies forward with his life .  poor second-string feature from universal pictures about a mama ' s boy movie actor doing criminal investigation work for the military , fending off the advances of the brash young woman he ' s been assigned to romance . robert montgomery directed and stars in this adaptation of the short story " come be my love " , and his acting performances of this era are unrelievedly lazy . the plot is sappy , predictable stuff , and writer robert carson has given all the really funny lines ( as usual for films of this period ) to the feisty black maid . it ' s always nice to see ann blyth and jane cowl in support , but they can ' t do much with this hokey material . * from * * * *  years ago , when darling lili played on tv , it was always the pan and scan version , which i hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format . so when i saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews / blake edwards opus , i decided to purchase and watch it once and for all . 

boy , what a terrible film . it ' s so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong . looking at it now , it ' s obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals ( mary poppins , sound of music , thoroughly modern millie , etc ) but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself ( camelot , my fair lady , etc ) because hollywood thought she wasn ' t sexy or glamorous enough . so blake created this stillborn effort , to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story / war movie / romance / slapstick comedy / musical . darling lili suffers from multiple personalities , never knowing who or what it is . some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole , it just doesn ' t work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing . 

mind you , the version on the dvd is the " director ' s cut " , or in this case , " let ' s salvage whatever we can " from this notorious box office flop . in releasing the dvd , edwards cut 19 scenes ( 19 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version . the film moves along with no idea of what it is . we are 25 minutes into it and we still don ' t know what ' s going on or why we ' re watching what ' s going . what kind of spy is lili ? how powerful is she ? was she ever responsible for someone ' s death ? instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews . things aren ' t helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love . why does julie fall for hudson ? why him and not other men she got involved with ? there should have been one of her ex hanging around , trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret . this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action . it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings . there ' s no catalyst in this story . 

one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews ' ( and edwards ' ) previous successes . the best ( or worst ) example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest . edwards channeling sound of music . it ' s no wonder he removed it from the dvd . back in 1970 , that scene might have worked on a certain level but today , that moment reeks of desperation . there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews / edwards other films . the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie . the musical moment " i ' ll give you three guesses " was created just to make fun of julie ' s mary poppins persona , which is turned " raunchy " with julie doing a striptease in the act . the ending , bird ' s eye view of julie running towards hudson ' s plane , is another " wink " at sound of music . 

the whole thing is confusing . julie plays a singer , born from a german father and british mother , who lives in england but sings her ( english ) songs in paris . you never know exactly where the story takes place . some moments are just badly edited . like when julie and her " uncle " are on horseback . they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in mid-sentence . i ' m like " what happened here ? " 

the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe-worthy . every scene with the french police are pathetic . where ' s peter sellers when you really need him . the action is stupid beyond belief . when julie and her " uncle " are on their way to germany on that train , hudson ' s squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train , almost killing lili in the process . brilliant . what ' s also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning . that ' s one slow moving train there . 

the musical moments . the beginning is the best part of the entire film ( and the reason i gave this film 3 stars ) but it ' s effect is diminished considerably because it ' s repeated at the end . speaking of redundant , did we really need to see a can-can dance , crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too ? the " girl in no man ' s land " is ok even if it ' s bleeding obvious , but that moment just doesn ' t make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital , making me wonder : how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying ? 

the whole project is listless and without energy . the romance is 100 % unbelievable . rock hudson is way too old and tired looking ( check out the museum scene ) . julie looks dazed , like she ' s on valium . but what really kills this ill-conceived project is julie playing a german spy . edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision . as much as i like julie , she ' s no greta garbo , who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari . funny enough , even if julie plays a german spy , she still comes across as cloying and cute . 

how bad is darling lili ? even after 37 years since its release , blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release .  in pasadena , mrs . davis ( joanna cassidy ) sends her daughter aubrey davis ( amber tamblyn ) to tokyo to bring her sister karen davis ( sarah michelle gellar ) , who is interned in a hospital after surviving a fire , back to the usa . after their meeting , karen dies and aubrey decides to investigate what happened to her and gets herself cursed in the same situation , being chased by the ghost of the house . meanwhile in tokyo , the three high school mates allison ( arielle kebbel ) , vanessa ( teresa palmer ) and miyuki ( misako uno ) visit the famous haunted house and are also cursed and chased by the ghost . in chicago , trish ( jennifer beals ) moves to the apartment of her boyfriend bill ( christopher cousins ) , who lives with his children , the teenager lacey ( sarah roehmer ) and boy jake ( matthew knight ) . on the next door , weird things happen with their neighbor . 

 " the grudge 2 " has scary sound and visual effects , with the creepy woman and boy , and i have startled a couple of times while watching this movie . however , the complex screenplay with three subplots is totally confused , making the entwined story a complete mess . there are too much characters and situations , and in a certain moment i was completely lost with the disconnected and fragmented narrative . in the end , i was completely disappointed with this confused , but also spooky film . my vote is four . 

title ( brazil ) : " o grito 2 " ( " the scream 2 " )  i think the movie was one sided i watched it recently and find the documentary typical of western movie makers that was biased without substance . the fact is prostitution do exist everywhere in the world not in tanzania alone and not because of this fish business , there prostitutes were there way before the russian and other business people arrived in mwanza . poverty is indeed endemic in africa let alone tanzania and this is not because of fish fillet business , in fact the fish industry has helped millions to support their families on their daily life . this movie just tarnish the good image of this peace loving country . as for the arms trade the film could not substantiate if there is any truth in that indeed looking critically at the films one is doubting the authenticity of the film maker , it seems that their trying to prove their point by using a few characters which can be done for anything really . yes tanzania is a poor country yes there are prostitutes and street children but they are not the product this business , it is just a common scenario in most poor countries indeed the world over even in the western world . . . what a load of rubbish . 

the pilot themselves are talking of sending weapons to angola which is more than 2000km south of tanzania and the war was in drc also miles away from mwanza , the director could not give evidence how these weapons were transported from mwanza to drc ! 

in short the films lacks focus and respectability , it is quite easy to find the character anywhere in africa and has nothing to do darwin ' s nightmare or fish fillet . . . what a load of rubbish ! 

the truth is the nile perch has not decimated all other species in the lake contrary to what the movie portrays and also less than 25 % of all catches from lake victoria are exported the rest is consumed locally so lets get that one right .  burt reynolds plays gator mcklusky , a likable ex-convict just released from prison who helps the feds nab a corrupt small town sheriff . laid-back reynolds was often accused by critics of merely phoning these ' good ol ' boy ' performances in ; true , he ' s on auto-pilot throughout . but in his day , reynolds knew just how to make a low-key effort work well for himself . ingratiating and handsome , reynolds comes as close to winking at the audience as he can without breaking up ; he seems to know these backwoods as well as any movie star , while director joesph sargent provides an easy pace and a sweaty ambiance which brings the south alive . unfortunately , the story isn ' t much , and supporting actors ned beatty and bo hopkins overact ( as usual ) . diane ladd is fine in a small part , and real-life daughter laura dern can be glimpsed in the background . reynolds returned to this character for 1976 ' s " gator " . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  i had the privilege of seeing this powerful play on broadway with kathy bates in the lead . i only saw one other play in the 1970 ' s-1990 ' s that had an emotional impact like this play did . i really looked forward to the play being made into a movie but was very disappointed when i learned that kathy bates wouldn ' t reprise her role in the film--she wasn ' t well known off broadway at the time and the producers must have wanted star power i suppose and cast sissy spacek instead . sissy did an adequate job in the lead role but did not measure up to kathy bates in any way . i love anne bancroft but she seemed too young for this role . the movie plot was true to the play . anyone who ever contemplates suicide should have to watch this movie to realize the devastation on those who are left behind .  sheltered young woman , home-schooled and possibly quite gifted , harbors a disturbed , overly-emotional side which comes to the surface after her absentee father pays her mother a visit , asking for a divorce . directed by celebrated cinematographer william a . fraker , this ill-titled psychological thriller falls into the trap that most films helmed by directors of photography find themselves in : each shot is composed for the utmost style , but at the sacrifice of fluid pacing and a tight , gripping narrative . fraker ( and his cinematographer , lÃ¡szlÃ³ kovÃ¡cs ) are very fond of gauzy whites and golden tones , giving the picture a burnished , tableaux feel . the mansion at the center of the action looks like a funeral parlor , and fraker paces the wheezing yarn just like a funeral . robert shaw and sally kellerman ( as shaw ' s fiancÃ©e ) , two of the most interesting actors of the 1970s , manage to cut through the plastic overlay and are quite compelling despite the jagged editing ( which turns their scenes into little bits of half-realized business ) . sondra locke , another interesting screen personality , seems cast for her resemblance to catherine deneuve in " repulsion " . pale and saucer-eyed , with imposingly thick and long hair , locke is a curious human puzzle , and she ' s initially quite intimidating and dangerous ; however , this role is so old-hat that locke can find nothing fresh to bring out of the deep freeze , and she flounders . fraker allows locke ' s freak-out scenes to go on and on , while shaw ( looking terrifically debonair ) is put in the impossible position of playing touchy-feely daddy to her . all of this nonsense might be worth slogging through if the screenplay had been peppered with a modicum of tangibility ( or , at the very least , some dry wit or humorous relief ) . as it is , lewis john carlino and edward hume ' s limp script , adapted from stanton forbes ' novel " go to thy deathbed " , strands the viewer early on , and only the charisma of the players gets us to the finish line . * 1 / 2 from * * * *   " people stranded in a country house during a storm discover that the home was the sight of an unsolved murder years before . during a dinner discussion of the incident , the lights go out and , when they come back on , they discover that one of the guests has been killed . fearing for their lives , the guests attempt to find out the secrets behind the death before others can occur , " according to the dvd sleeve ' s synopsis . 

there are a couple of clever twists in this murder at the " old dark house " story , with the " play within a play " being its most interesting feature . however , the direction is rather ordinary , which serves to highlight a certain cheapness of production . like most movies of this type , there is ( or , should be ) an ensemble of intriguing characters . herein , only old-time broadway producer richard carle ( as herman wood ) and his fey secretary johnny arthur ( as homer erskine ) maintain interest . 

 * * * * the ghost walks ( 12 / 1 / 34 ) frank r . strayer ~ richard carle , johnny arthur , john miljan this espionage melodrama has a nice , almost promising cast , and should have been very atmospheric ; there is a will , or an intention of atmosphereÂand also a want , or a lack of it . 

sheen plays a dissident who now activates as an agent , he is a loner , loved by women but haughty ; mrs . fossey is his mistress . neill plays the gallant , generous , chivalrous soviet agent . 

sheen and neill are both essentially annoying ; finlay does a cameo , and so do other known actors . mrs . fossey is hot ; but then again , she always is . 

i will be your true friend and break it to youÂthe flick is low on suspense and on excitement , it ' s trite and quite boring ; the good thing is that you get to see mrs . fossey naked . other than that , lukewarm derivative espionage exploitation .  i can imagine what happened for this film to come into being : a bunch of studio guys are sitting around , drinking gin-and-tonic , maybe a joint , and one of them comes up with the idea that it would be great if they could find a film that would bridge the generation gap , which at that time was about as far apart as archie bunker and mick jagger . something that both college-age rebels and their parents would find equally interesting-- for different reasons , perhaps , but still , a ticket is a ticket . what interested hippies ? asia , philosophy , pacifism , and wild sets and costumes . what interested their parents ? musicals , eye candy , a feel-good script , and nostalgia . very well , then , " lost horizon " , the old classic , as a musical , in color . can ' t miss , right ? it was a bomb . lost horizon , by james hilton , is perhaps less than a classic , but not a bad novel . in broad terms , he sketches out a utopian society in shangri-la , " the valley of the blue moon " , near tibet , inhabited by peacefully contented villagers who serve an abbey of <i>very< / i> long-lived monks . intruding into paradise is a gilligan ' s island-like planeful of outsiders ( a veteran of wwi , a missionary , etc . ) each with their own spin on the situation -- what plot there is concerns the reaction of each of them to being presented with a choice to live in paradise , or try to return to the tumult of the twentieth century . taken on its own terms , it ' s gentle , pop-lit fluff , presenting hilton ' s own conservative british views in " oriental " dress , as exotic and as familiar as a fortune cookie . as captive honored guests of the monks , the castaways are forbidden to leave the valley , but never pressed into work or prayer ( not that the monks do too much of that themselves ) , treated royally , and given simple , yet luxurious accomodations --who ' d want to escape ? in this middle american heaven-on-earth , the monks are both cultured and wise , the climate is warm , the food is plentiful and tasty , the villagers are picturesque nonentities and nothing ever changes . the nuns are chaste , but encouraged to look pretty , and even flirt a bit ( the reason given is one of the most hilariously inaccurate explanations of tantric sex i ' ve ever read ) . even their religion is nonthreatening : revealed as a best-of-both worlds blend of christianity and buddhism , there ' s little to offend any but the staunchest fundamentalist or the oddballs out there who actually knew something about tibet ( which in the early thirties was a very small number ) . 

as a capra film focussing on the adventure / character interplay angles it was enchanting ; and perhaps steven spielburg could have made it fly , if he ' d been around . as an early-seventies hollywood product , the adventure was over too quickly , and the updated roster of characters too bland , to make much of an impression . deprived of the sketchy , suggestive qualities of classic b & w , the monastery resembles a de luxe beauty spa in white and pale blue , and while at least some of the monks ' robes tried for historical accuracy , most of the rest of the inmates looked as if on their way to a morning massage and fango bath , with a couple of holes of golf in the afternoon . maybe stephan sondheim could have restored some grit to the story , playing up the very real conflict inside each character ' s reaction ; just five years afterwards , brian eno would have captured the tranquil atmosphere to a t ; instead , bert bacherach and hal david were given the job of writing the songs , which marry muzak-like melodies with some of the clunkiest new agey lyrics ever penned . quite naturally for the time , every song calls for a dance number , which range from the merely forgettable to the completely boring , and so is the script , which has not one line worth quoting . 

tie-ins with this movie were legion -- there were everything from cookbooks to posters planned to promote this film , and such was the hype that i actually went out and bought the sountrack album . just about the only thing good i can say about it is that it made enough of an impression on me to write this review completely from memory nearly thirty years after -- the next month i read aldous huxley , bought a copy of the bardo thadol , and hence learned about real tibetan culture . moan . 

 while the new pride & prejudice film is gorgeous to view , and the soundtrack is lovely , we are not seeing jane austen ' s pride and prejudice . the film is for some reason set back in the early 1790 ' s , rather than the regency period where the novel is set , as scholars have long shown . the bennets ' longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like cold comfort farm . yet the bennets in the novel are gentry class ; they own a farm , but the pig does not walk through the house , nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home . scenes are re-set from the novel , and lest we forget , jane austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason . for example , the film puts the big darcy proposal scene outside in a storm in front of a neoclassical temple , as opposed to inside the collins ' parsonage : why did jane austen put it in the parsonage ? because while lizzy and darcy speak with total , if brutal honesty to each other in this scene , the collinses have never shared an honest word . why the rain and the outdoor proposal ? it looks like jane eyre meeting rochester ! and when elizabeth walks across a windy field to stand on a cliff and view the panorama , one expects her to cry , " heathcliffe " at any minute ! austen has been bronteized ! judy dench is a great actress , but lady catherine is supposed to be tall and striking . the petite tom hollander is a brilliant actor : but mr . collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy-looking , which suggests that his terrible dancing with poor lizzy is elephantine . matthew macfayden is another favorite of mine from mi-5 on a & e ; in p & p , however , he is more the young heathcliffe , never smiling--though austen observes in the novel that darcy smiles at lizzy quite a bit , and she realizes this when she sees his wonderful smiling portrait at pemberley--a portrait that in this movie is for some reason replaced by a sculptured marble bust . and much of austen ' s dialogue is changed to modern speech . mr . bingley has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why darcy would have him as a friend and why jane bennet would love him . the bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear , it deviates from jane austen ' s novel so much that any student who watched it , thinking she could substitute viewing for reading , would fail !  honest young insurance agent ronald reagan ( as eric gregg ) is optimistic , but poor . his wife , scheming sheila bromley ( as nona gregg ) , longs for the finer things in life . describing herself as " not weighted down with tons of righteousness , " ms . bromley begins to spend more money than mr . reagan earns . bromley obtains the finer things in life , but puts the couple in debt . bromley is a fun shrew . 

handsome reagan attracts other women , like perky clerk gloria blondell ( as patricia carmody ) ; but , he doesn ' t indulge . to pay the bills , bromley gets tangled up in the insurance fraud racket - which helps get her husband fired . an unemployed reagan seems to be tempted into a life of crime - will he remain straight up , or get crooked ? clinton rosemond has an uncomfortable " broken arm " scene .

 ( black and white - short film ) 

two luckless nightclub revellers ( laurel and hardy ) are unable to pay their bill , provoking violent retribution from a hot-tempered waiter ( tiny sandford ) . 

typical l & h scenario , less substantial than some of their best work from this period , but worth a look nonetheless . stan takes center-stage this time round , caught up in a financial dilemma after holding back part of his wages to fund a night on the town , only to find out - too late ! - that his aggrieved wife ( fay holderness ) has replaced his stash with worthless coupons . some of the prolonged closeups of laurel as he slowly becomes aware of the unfolding disaster reveal his genius for characterization and mime . 1920 ' s morality is represented by patsy o ' byrne , playing a hatchet-faced busy-body who takes great joy in alerting l & h ' s respective spouses ( holderness and lyle taho ) to their husbands ' bad behavior . the ending fizzles , but the movie still has much to recommend it . directed by james parrott .  another of those flimsy stories coupled with most forgettable musical numbers . powell and o ' keefe as battling publicists are quite forgettable . however , there are two shining moments . hubert castle is the most incredible tightrope walker you will ever see - his " drunken walk " on the wire has to be the most spectacular piece of balancing ever recorded on film . he has to be seen to be believed . the other is sophie tucker doing a turn near the end of the film . her magnetism , her professionalism , her sheer talent at being herself - well , charisma is not learned - you have it or you don ' t . a great lesson for all would-be cabaret artists . a sad note : w . c . fields in his last film cameo is completely forgettable .  anthony perkins and sophia loren are absolutely gorgeous in this ca . 1840 " western " . that alone , however doesn ' t help a ridiculous story , with countless historically incorrect elements . 

byrl ives is convincing as the 70-something tyrannical patriarch , an egomaniac who swears to see his 100th birthday . his wild dancing at a party he gives for his neighbors will make anyone take notice ( this guy is sevety six ? ) . always mumbling bible verses , he demands respect , while driving sons and friends away with his self-righteous rantings and emotional cruelties . 

the love affair between perkins and loren at first appears absurd , but becomes believable near the end . there is plenty of drama , but not enough to feel good about . clearly written for the stage , this story was dated even when it was filmed . perkins whistles " my bonnie " in the 1840s , although the song wasn ' t composed until 1882 . 

critics knocking sophia lorens " command of the english language " are rather petty . i found her english flawless and completely audible . as a neapolitan , loren speaks a distinct dialect that often had to be dubbed into " proper italian " . her " accent " , however , hardly affects how she speaks english . as a first generation german american , i can appreciate the efforts of those who learn english as a second , or even third or fourth language . 

 " desire under the elms " is a drama ( or even a tragedy ) in the classic sense . for my enjoyment is was missing a logical story and an overall " pay off " for the time invested . fans of the stars won ' t want to miss it , others , however , tune in at your own risk !  on the heels of the well received and beloved coming of age film classic , concerning the lives of teenagers as they headed into adulthood , george lucas ' american graffiti , we have cooley high . an adaptation of sorts by one eric monte , co creator of the popular 1970 ' s cbs sitcom good times . 

cooley high was , and is , viewed as a black version of american graffiti . instead of central california , as in american graffiti , we have the black slum of chicago ' s cabrini green as the backdrop for the story here . instead of america in 1962 cooley high is situated in 1964 . the movie stars welcome back kotter ' s , lawrence hilton jacobs and glynn turman as the movie main protagonists and its ' main characters . it has garrett morris playing the principal who tries to keep jacobs ' and turman ' s characters , named coceise and preach , out of trouble a great deal of the time . 

you know , i would like to say that cooley high is a worthy comparison piece to american graffiti or that it is a great film on its ' own but i can ' t . the problem lies with the fact that the producers of the film couldn ' t or wouldn ' t hide the sad underside of black life in america . having the film in the cabrini green part of chicago doesn ' t help things . 

neither does the crass gross attempts at humor here . when coceise is looking for a letter of intent from a college he finds his little brother has thrown down a toilet . when the gang visits the chicago zoo , one of the gang named pooter , has manure thrown on him by an ape . when the turman ' s character , preach , is being chased by two hoodlums in the school hangout ( a dirty and depressing place to eat food in much less meet people at ) , he opens the door of the girls ' bathroom while a girl is relieving herself as he escapes through the window of the same bathroom ! the high school , the homes of the characters , the bathrooms , just about everywhere in the film displays the unfortunate look of urban decay and poverty . 

if that wasn ' t enough there was the rough display of humor in the film . the use of violence and profanity in the film . cooley high may be an coming of age film , but it is a hard and rough coming of age film with little or none of the wit and liking of the use of nostalgia that made people like and appreciate american graffiti so much . 

motown records had a hand in making the film . the company ' s music was part of the film ' s soundtrack . but even here you get a sense of same old same old as one has heard these songs before a million times over . not that they weren ' t great songs within themselves but black music , of that time period was more than just motown . especially in chicago . the song nearing the end of the movie , by the spinners ' g . c . cameron , was not all that impressive . there have been better motown ballads that have been done , by better motown artists than cameron without question . 

the last part of the film showing where the characters went to pay homage to the film cooley high aimed to be , american graffiti . it shows that preach , an intelligent but underachieving student went to hollywood and became a successful television writer . eric monte may have patterned himself as turman ' s character . the last shot of film show ' s preach running away from coceise ' s funeral , held on a dark rainy afternoon , and all the bleakness that cooley high came to represent . eric monte , through preach and that final scene , had one little lesson for all of us when watching cooley high and for the love of the past . don ' t look back .  the film begins in latvia just after wwi . being a history teacher , i knew that multinational troops occupied much of russia during this time . there was serious concern about the spread of bolshevism and the troops were there ostensibly to protect their nations ' interests . however , some times they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the communist army , as the nations involved really wanted to see the so-called " whites " win . however , the whites were deeply factionalized--some wanting the return of a czar , some wanting a republic and some wanting something in between . because of these mixed goals and a lack of a real commitment by the foreign armies , the whole expedition was doomed and left the ussr after only a year or two . however , what i did not know was that german troops were also involved . this surprised me , as they had just lost wwi and weren ' t in the best shape to be mounting such an expedition . 

this is the backdrop for the film , but it ' s also about a pro-communist rich lady and her ill-fated love for a childhood friend who is among the german troops . she throws herself at him repeatedly but in each case he rebuffs her . so , she then sublimates these desires by various affairs . while none of this sex is all that graphic , this and the underlying reason the man isn ' t interested make this a rather adult film and one i wouldn ' t show to younger audiences . 

while the setting for this film is interesting , the overall film is as gray and lifeless as any i have seen . i don ' t recommend it unless you are an amazingly patient person or you are really into overrated german films . i especially warn away anyone who suffers with depression , as it will no doubt make it worse . the simple fact is that there are so many better german films out there waiting to be seen--such as mostly martha , das boot , mother kusters goes to heaven , wings of desire or ali , fear eats the soul ( among others ) .  i went to see this because i ' d never seen tel-aviv , where the story is set . i was disappointed , since it doesn ' t offer many views of israel ' s largest metropolis . it ' s also pretentiousÂone of those movies that leaves you guessing at its meaning until you ultimately give up with a shrug of the shoulders . 

the main protagonist is batya , a woman in her twenties ' who works as a waitress at catered weddings . her parents evidently don ' t care about her very much , and when a little girl walks out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her , batya feels compelled to take care of her . the little girl doesn ' t speak , and batya can ' t give her to social services because it ' s the weekend and the agency is closed . so she takes her back to her apartment with the leaky roof , and when it comes time to work in the evening , she has to take the little girl with her . the boss is very unhappy about this and other shortcomings in batya ' s work performance . 

another main character is keren , who is getting married . at her wedding party ( where batya is of course working ) , she breaks her leg climbing out of a ladies ' room cubicle whose door won ' t open , and so she and her new husband cannot take the caribbean vacation they ' ve planned . they end up in a dingy hotel on the seafront without a view . it smells bad , there is noise from the traffic , and keren is complaining all the time . her husband meets a strangely attractive older woman Â a writer Â who is also staying in the hotel , and keren worries that he has slept with this stranger . 

the third main character is a filipino woman named joy who looks after old people . the old woman she is hired to care for is very crabby and speaks no english , only german and hebrew . joy speaks english but no hebrew or german . joy is mostly concerned with how her son is doing back in the philippines , and wants to buy him a toy boat , as he has asked . she finds the perfect boat in a store and plans to buy it . the daughter of the old woman , who hired joy , is an actress appearing in some sort of post-modern " physical theater " adaptation of hamlet , and does not get along with her mother . 

the way in which these three storiesÂwhich intersect momentarilyÂresolve themselves is presumably supposed to mean something profound . i didn ' t get it . there is a fantasy element to batya ' s relationship with the little girl , and maybe batya ' s non-existent relationship with her parents is somehow inverted in this relationship . when joy sees the toy boat in the shop window , there is a strange effect used where the little sails billow as if blown by the wind , and they do this as if they are on the scale of a real-life ship . keren draws the outline of a bottle around a ship that is on a brochure cover in the hotel room , and a narration of the strange woman ' s poetry mentions a ship in a bottle . but what does all this mean ? i thought about it for a while and realized i wasn ' t going to lose any sleep in the process . if anyone out there has a clear idea of what it ' s all about , maybe they can fill me in .  sometimes you get exactly what you expect . a film produced and by and as a vehicle for a rock band in the middle of a comeback is not to be expected to rank high in artistic merit- and in this case it certainly doesn ' t . in fact , as expected , the soundtrack is a much better investment than the movie itself , which like the 70 ' s rock and roll lifestyle it attempts to portray , is characterized by excess , drugs , and over-the-top antics , but unfortunately is not nearly as much fun . utilizing a script by carl dupre horrible enough to make a fellow screenwriter cringe , and wasting the talents of edward furlong , the sole highlight of this rock and roll period piece gone wrong is the music , most notably the elaborate recreating of a 1978 kiss concert .  bugsy siegel was 31 when he went out to the west coast . in addition to his dreams about las vegas , he toyed with the idea of acting . he was a good looking guy and about 7 years younger than his pal george raft , so it wasn ' t such a crazy idea . 

warren beatty was 54 when he made this movie and despite the hair dye , he ' s too old for this part . beatty was miscast ; bugsy should have been played by someone like alec baldwin . bugsy was a tough guy feared by his contemporaries ; beatty just doesn ' t radiate menace . 

this was a vanity project for beatty , who hasn ' t come to terms with the fact that he ' s no longer a leading man . 

the other big annoying miscast is mantegna as george raft . raft had a distinctive voice and mannerisms , none of which mantegna even attempts to match . you never once believe that mantegna came from the streets . 

warren beatty and robert redford have both been pretending to be younger for years by massive use of hair dye , and now it ; ll be a shock to suddenly go gray and play character parts .  bobcat goldthwait should be commended for attempting to do something different with this surprisingly heartfelt film , a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of being honest about everything . melinda hamilton stars as amy , a girl who has had oral sex with a canine in the past on a lark . she struggles with telling her fiancÃ© , john . of course the truth does rear it ' s shaggy ugly head . the film deals with the fallout of said escapade . the movie is well-acted by all , save for perhaps jack plotnick as dougie , who never really felt like he mashed well with the picture . and the film while solid enough seems to miss it ' s mark a few times . every single person in the film struggles with massive hypocrisy and all our a tad hard to relate to . bobcat should be commended for doing something different , as i said before , but different does not always equal good and this pales ever so slightly not to goldthwaits own directorial debut , the criminally misunderstood " shakes the clown " 

my grade : c- now i have seen two movies by the director chen kaige , a very good one ( farewell my concubine ) , and this bad one , the assassin . both movies depict crucial events in chinese history , fmc in the 20th century and ta the first unification of the whole chinese nation in the 3rd century bc . fmc succeds with memorable characters , gorgeous cinematography , convincing sets , good acting and an interesting story . the assassin fails on nearly every level ( okay , the sets are great , the cinematography is good , and the few battle scenes are quite exciting ) . but . . . the pathos . call me a cynic , but too much is too much . if you felt that saving private ryan was too pathetic , be aware , this here will make you sick . the dialogue is lifeless , many lines seem like political statements , subtle or entertaining is this pic not . the film is overpowered by its own pompousness . i am really surprised that the assassin gets such high votes here on imdb . 4 / 10 i fully agree with the previous reviewer . there ' s no chemistry between spencer tracy and hedy lamarr , and the focus of the film is on their relationship . hedy lamarr isn ' t at her best , and spencer tracy appears to be naive , simple and overly-hopeful -- both in love and life ; an idealist role that played out best in ' boys town ' . if you can make it through the ridiculous crowd scene by the train station . . . whoa . . . it ' s rather slapstick and not worthy of any actor in the cast . not the best acting on anybody ' s part . miscast and mismatched . story is empty and various and disenfranchised input is apparent . hedy lamarr is her absolutely stunning herself , which is truly the best part of the film . spencer tracy can ' t match the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe , and the film doesn ' t come off as believable for at least that reason .  greedy land baron in the tiny western town of prairie city wants all the ranchers off their land , using intimidation tactics and arson to get them to vacate ; seems the town is swimming atop oil , and when a swedish farmer refuses to leave , he ' s mowed down by the baron ' s hired gun . the farmer ' s seafaring son soon arrives , slowly realizing what he ' s up against and attempting to rally the rest of the residents to fight . another lawlessness-in-the-west story , with everybody under the thumb of the villain ( who naturally holds all the cards ) . derivative and uncomfortable at times to watch , with a long wait before our stoic hero finally gets his dander up . sterling hayden ' s half-hearted swedish accent is a big problem , though he cuts a sturdy , sympathetic presence on the screen and almost makes the picture worth-watching . director joseph h . lewis stages most of the scenes stiffly , like a tv western , and gerald fried ' s bugle-heavy score is no help , though the rich black-and-white cinematography by ray rennahan is excellent . an independent production released via united artists , the film has a bizarre start ( beginning with shots from the finale , followed by shots from the movie ' s midsection ) , yet it does have a certain needling power which most assuredly gets the viewer on hayden ' s side . * * from * * * *  in the animated series : 

aeon flux was an amoral rebel that was completely detached from everything and everyone . she was cruel , selfish , loving , unpredictable , witty , caustic , confident , sarcastic , lethal , untamable , ambiguous all at once . the original aeon had layers upon layers of depth . she almost never allowed her personal emotions to show through . the original plot was deliciously ambiguous and thought provoking . you could never tell what aeon ' s motives were . aeon was a militant anarchist whereas trevor was a radical idealist , because of this they could never have any semblance of a stable relationship . 

in the movie : 

aeon flux works for the monicans and her political motives and personal motives are very clear . she was pretty , loving , vulnerable , easily tamable , emotional and very predictable . the aeon in the movie had one layer of depth at most . the plot was obvious and contrived . everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning . there was virtually no conflict between aeon and trevor , at least in terms of personal philosophies . the only conflict between them was that they were on different sides . 

the movie was a horrible disappointment to me . i felt betrayed . they took the idea of one of my favorite animated characters of all time , squeezed all the depth and personality out of her , and pumped her full of hollywood clichÃ©s . the essence of the animated series was completely lost in this movie . 

the only reason i ' m not giving this movie a " 1 " is because the visuals were incredible . it was neat to see some of the familiar animated scenes like the fly in the eye done with cgi .  this is only the fourth effort iâve watched from this director ( whom i met and found quite genial at the 2004 venice film festival italian b-movie retrospective ) and also , possibly , the worst . as was the case with the bronx executioner ( 1989 ) , which preceded it , this is a prime example from the tail end of the euro-cult era â prime because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen by this time ! 

here , in fact , we get a plot revolving around â iâm not kidding , folks â a killer phone ! pretty but bland charlotte lewis â in her third film after pirates ( 1986 ) and the golden child ( 1986 ) â is a model who , apparently , has just ended an affair ; she keeps expecting her architect lover to call her back but , every time the phone rings , all she gets is static accompanied by voices from the beyond ( or some such crap ) . she befriends a new tenant at her apartment block who , conveniently , knows of an authority on paranormal activity ( william berger ) â who , hilariously , explains that the negative energy which is unleashed , say , during family arguments can manifest itself via home appliances into a deadly force ( i swear i ainât making this up ) ! 

among the highlights . . . er . . . lowpoints of the film are : the grumpy bartender from whose dingy place the heroine calls a couple of times ( it seems that the chain-of-events can only be broken by having lewis go through her paces again , exterminating angel ( 1962 ) -style ! ) , the sheer variety of preposterous-looking phones on display , the apparatus of the heroineâs photographer friend sneaking up on her before the kill , the sarcastic cop who greets lewis on reporting the strange occurrences ( âand whatâs the toaster up to , i wonder ? â ) , the would-be rapist killed by a barrage of coins shooting out from a telephone booth , and bergerâs own bloody demise ( with the phone affecting the pacemaker heâs fitted with and causing the doctorâs heart to explode ) ! 

the filmâs climax is rather confusing and , apparently , finally sees all the âlost soulsâ inhabiting a flock of doves and flying out the window of the âpossessedâ office ( a lonelyhearts service ! ) . for what itâs worth , the score â by ex-goblin claudio simonetti no less â is effective enough , despite the inclusion of dated heavy-metal numbers on the soundtrack .  the emperor ' s new groove cast returns for disney pictures follow up , but this time the spotlight is on kronk ( voiced by patrick warburton ) , who is no longer yzma ' s ( eartha kitt ) henchman . kronk has started a new life and is very happy with his role as chef of his own restaurant . things go merrily along until kronk gets word that his papi ( john mahoney ) is coming for a visit . kronk is worried , because he knows that his life won ' t impress his papi . one thing that he has always wanted and never received is a " thumbs up " from his dad . a flurry of blunders and a gigantic cheese explosion in the restaurant leaves our likable hero very deep in trouble and anxiety . to save the day , a little help from his friends . 

other voices : tracey ullman , david spade , john goodman , wendie malick , april winchell and gatlin green .  since the characters begin with " unknown " identities , they not identified by name , so you start with handsome james caviezel waking up in a warehouse . he finds out the place is locked up tight . don ' t ask - the windows are made with security glass , and it ' s impossible to get out . four other awakening men make it a quintet - mr . caviezel in his " jean jacket " , barry pepper in a " ranger shirt " , greg kinnear with a " broken nose " , joe pantoliano as a chair " bound man " , and jeremy sisto shot and " handcuffed man " . oh , man 

these five men have collective amnesia . they think that three of them are kidnappers , and two are victims - but , they don ' t know who is which or which is who . the forgetfulness is due to a pipe leak . don ' t ask - it happens . meanwhile , on the outside , lead lawman david selby ( as parker ) sends his cops to solve the kidnapping while one of the men ' s wives , bridget moynahan ( as eliza coles ) , frantically waits . but , criminal element ' s gang leader , peter stormare in " snakeskin boots " , is also on his way to the scene . 

like the dvd synopsis says , " as secrets are revealed and clues unraveled , ( the five men ) must race against time to figure out who is good and who is evil in order to stay alive . " this story reads a lot better than it looks on film , unfortunately . when the secrets are finally revealed , and memories become clear , there is no longer much interest in what has happened . simply , director simon brand has a great premise with matthew waynee ' s idea , but they encumber light investment in the characters holding the short end of the stick . 

 * * * * unknown ( 11 / 1 / 06 ) simon brand ~ james caviezel , barry pepper , greg kinnear , david selby as a recent convert to curb your enthusiasm , which prompted my viewing of all season ' s episodes , i expected more , much more from jeff ' s efforts . 

when i view a film offering a slice of an average ' joe ' s ' life i need reasons to be interested , to care , to feel and believe . and with jeff garlin at the helm i also expected a bevy of shining comedic moments . this film failed me time and again . 

jeff plays a living with mom , plump sad sack who is a social disaster . he has not had a relationships , real or even casual , for many years . he appears to be mostly unemployed and , as noted , shacks with his mommy dearest . can things get worse ? sure . in short order he gets sacked by everyone around him including silverman , second city ( his comedy workshop ) and his agent . all reinforce his ' loser ' status . silverman ' s ' fatty ' experiment was as cruel as it was absurd . his obsession with the role of " marty , " as the means of his career ' s salvation , also hits a big dead end . 

while the film ' s final moments offer a glimpse of better things to come the cinematic ' journey , ' albeit with occasional golden glimmers , was sadly lacking .  imagine an exploitive remake of the defiant ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other . set the story on some caribbean island where the drug dealers rule and the revolution has arrived . and have the black woman be from huggy bear ' s stable of ladies and the white woman be a watered down patty hearst and you ' ve got black mama , white mama . 

in those waning days of the drive-in theater this item must have been a big old hit . all the hot buttons of the seventies are pushed in this one . even though they both fill out their clothes better and will get a few whistles from the males in the audience no one is ever going to mistake pam grier and margaret markov for sidney poitier and tony curtis . all right , halle berry and jamie lee curtis . 

margaret and pam are prisoners where the guards and the warden look lasciviously at the new fish arriving . margaret is a rich girl from the state who took up ' the revolution ' , whilst pam ' s your basic high priced call girl who ' s been servicing the local drug kingpin and grew tired of it and tried to leave the island . 

margaret ' s fellow revolutionaries ambush the bus transporting them from the women ' s prison to town , but they get lost in the escape . both have their different agendas , but like sid and tony they can ' t quite agree on whose agenda comes first . makes for some interesting times as the police , the drug dealers , and the revolutionaries are all looking for these two illfated chain buddies . 

just so you don ' t get any wrong ideas the head of the revolutionaries and markov ' s kanoodling partner is named ernesto played by filipino actor zaldy zshornack . the whole mess was shot in the phillipines who were getting their own film industry started . 

nice location photography in the phillipines is all that black mama , white mam has to recommend it . but if you ' re a fan of really bad black exploitation flicks , this is one for you .  by-the-numbers , oscar-hungry biopic about the late , great singer ray charles . there is one -- exactly one -- great scene in * ray * . it occurs during a flashback to charles ' youth , after the boy become completely blind . running into the sharecropper house which he shares with his mother , he trips over a chair and sprawls on the floor . he cries out for his mother ; she , in keeping with her philosophy that a person should " stand on their own two feet " , observes silently and pensively from the kitchen , waiting to see if the boy can fall back on his own resources . the boy proves to be up to the challenge , using his ears and memory to locate a kettle on a stove , a nearby fire-pit , the grass blowing in the wind outside of a window , the scuttling of a cricket across the plank-board floor . 

the movie pauses , here ; it expands ; it breathes -- even if for only 40 seconds . the scene is a much-needed respite from taylor hackford ' s otherwise noisy film . by " noisy " i ' m not referring to the music , which is , of course , excellent . i am referring to the sound effects ( big booms ! preceding yet another flashback ) and the inane dialog ( " i ' m speaking to you as a friend , ray , " etc . ) . on the visual side , hackford is equally and pointlessly flashy : sepia-colored filters over the camera lenses during the flashbacks ; whirling-dervish 360s from the camera-crane , etc . etc . all the modern amenities . what a horrible cinematic style is displayed in * ray * ! -- a style all-too-common in wanna-be " important " movies from the past decade or so ( scorsese ' s * aviator * is stylistically very similar to this movie ) . these gimmicks are employed to obfuscate the clichÃ©-ridden screenplay . some of us won ' t be fooled . 

some of us also are not quite prepared to accept jamie foxx ' s performance as anything more than superb mimicry . granted , foxx eerily resembles ray charles : he walks like charles , talks like charles , and even twitches like charles . foxx ' s imitation of the singer during live performance is technically perfect . i ' m not begrudging mr . foxx his oscar ; he deserved it . ( it was a pretty weak field this year , anyway . ) but one wonders if foxx really understands charles . the actor does achieve one great moment when he insists on trying out the smack that his band-mates are shooting up : he registers , if only for a brief moment , a disgust at the unfairness of being blind and a life of darkness . the movie seems to want to dramatize the struggle within charles between the bright salvation of music and the oblivion of heroin , with his blindness as the battleground between those two compulsions . but the damn movie just won ' t take the time : it bounces along from triumph to triumph , never really pausing for any insight into the man . one has to stretch to find the dramatic tension ; one must supply the drama for the movie . one must , in other words , imagine a better movie than this one . 

in its rush toward a glorious conclusion , * ray * introduces , then dodges , several excellent ideas for a movie : his early days on the " chitlin circuit " ; his bold musical innovations for the atlantic label ; the problem of his addiction to heroin ; the inevitable artistic compromises attendant upon overwhelming success ; the man ' s importance to the civil rights struggle ( touched on in the movie for , oh , about 3 minutes of screen-time ) , and much more . the filmmakers are too lazy to focus on any one of these elements . two-and-a-half hours of watching a man overcome one adversity after another may make us feel good , but such a movie is not necessarily a grand work of art . this sort of approach certainly provides no deeper insight into the film ' s subject -- and shouldn ' t insight be the real goal of a movie like this ? if i had wanted a laundry-list of ray charles ' accomplishments , i ' d have simply googled him . 

3 stars out of 10 -- the extra 2 stars strictly for the music .  as ben elton once observed , nothing goes quicker out of style than comedy . steve martin ' s latest offering - ' the pink panther 2 ' - recently opened to bad reviews and dismal box-office grosses , while mike myers ' ' the love guru ' seems to have won few admirers . 

in 1970 , it was jerry lewis ' turn to feel the pain of rejection ( ironically , his character in this film experiences a funny turn whenever anyone uses that word in his presence ) when ' which way to the front ? ' effectively drove him off the big screen for almost a decade . 

in this world war two comedy , he plays ' brendan byers 111 ' , the richest man in the world , who wants to join the army to do his patriotic duty ( and also because he is bored with being successful ) but is rejected as he is medically unfit . he then decides to start his own privately funded army , recruiting other 4-f ' s . 

decked out with ludicrous uniforms that look like those worn by ' international rescue ' in ' thunderbirds ' , they go into training . some good visual gags here . when they fire rocket launchers , they look pleased with themselves , until they learn they have just destroyed a texaco oil station ! wishing to learn german , brendan plays a long-playing record called ' songs to mein kampf by ' . when this army sits down to eat , instead of being in a draughty mess hall , they are in an opulent room decked out with a chandelier . 

john wood is very funny as ' finkel ' , byers ' ever-so english butler . his best scene is when he blackmails a mafia-type gangster into teaching byers ' brigade to kill . 

the script was not by jerry himself , but by gerald gardiner and dee caruso , author of a number of episodes of ' the monkees ' . ' front ' often has the look and feel of a television sitcom , indeed at times you almost expect to hear a laugh-track . 

where it goes badly wrong is in the last thirty minutes when byers replaces a top nazi commander and , after ordering the germans to withdraw from the front , gets involved in the plot to kill hitler ( and tom cruise is nowhere in sight ! ) . as the commander , jerry delivers a performance of such mind-numbing ineptitude as to defy description . he gives brian blessed a run for his money in the ' loudest man alive ' stakes . it comes as a relief when the end credits appear . 

perhaps the timing was just wrong - bringing out a war comedy when the vietnam conflict was raging was not a good idea . or the public simply had had enough of jerry ( that beard probably did not help ! ) . what he needed here was a good producer , someone to take him in hand and say : " that gag stinks . throw it out ! " . ' don ' t raise the bridge , lower the river ' is a masterpiece by comparison with this picture . 

as the ' 70 ' s got underway , the new comedy icons would be woody allen , mel brooks , and monty python - fresher , more biting and in allen ' s case , more human styles of comedy replaced jerry ' s brand of slapstick . it would not be until 1982 that he would make anything like a successful comeback - as the conceited talk-show host ' jerry langford ' in martin scorcese ' s brilliant ' the king of comedy ' .  synopsis correction : the ending does not show ben cruising online for guys . he is looking up arabic language courses at the presido military acadamy in san francisco . perhaps to join the war in iraq as a translator , ( fyi- many of the dishonorable discharges from " d ' ont ask d ' ont tell have been translators ( they are now it major short supply ) ben also spoke russian . this movie is a good time capsule of life in manhatten but quite a bit of non reality here . mostly a good laugh at lame social skills and the sad portrayal of " grown up " twenty somethings not developing beyond the college party mode . also a brief study of the always changing scene in manhatten . ( somehow it always stays close to the edge of the same b . s . ) 

watch together the films " englishman in new york " " and the " the new twenty " both good for nostalgia . i think the movie " twenty " shows how far the blur between gay and straight as evolved . 

these two films are gay time travel for sure ! ! ! ! enjoy irvine welsh ' s follow up to trainspotting hits the screen as three short stories set in edinburgh , all with a few of welsh ' s trade marks , drug culture , depression , the working class and hibernian football club . uneasy to watch in places , it is no less than very well written , 2 of the stories having a darkly comic twist to them while the 2nd story a serious ( and shockingly realistic ) plot to it . will not appeal to most , including myself to a point , but will no doubt adopt a cult following .   " jefferson in paris " is a truly confounding film . it presents thomas jefferson ( nick nolte ) in the most unflattering light possible , painting him as a liar , racist and pedophile , yet offers not a shred of condemnation for those sins . this is the way he was , the film seems to say . end of sentence , end of movie , the door ' s behind you . 

after arriving in paris with his daughter patsy ( gwenyth paltrow ) , jefferson proceeds to win the heart of maria cosway ( greta scacchi ) , the wife of a homosexual english painter ( the criminally underused simon callow ) . a turn of events sends maria to england , however , and jefferson proceeds to forget her with astonishing speed for a man who , mere minutes of screen time before , was asking her to live with him in america . 

he ' s been bewitched , you see , by sally hemmings ( thandie newton ) , one of his slaves just arrived from america . just why he ' s bewitched is hard to tell--although sally is undeniably beautiful , she acts like a simple-minded child in front of jefferson . when she isn ' t telling ghost stories in exaggerated " darky " speech patterns , she ' s slinking around his bedroom , practically oozing lust for her distinguished massa . 

if her behavior is an attempt to excuse jefferson ' s , it doesn ' t work . jefferson damns himself further when maria , tired of waiting for his letters , travels from england to see him . i ' ve not changed toward you , he insists , offering weak excuses for not writing . to her credit , maria sees through his brazen lies immediately . when sally appears , and she and jefferson flirt openly ( and cruelly , to my mind ) in maria ' s very presence , the illusion falls apart completely . 

no one today believes that jefferson , washington and the rest were utter paragons of virtue and morality . yet , are we supposed to believe that the learned , distinguished jefferson would be attracted to sally , a woman whose most intelligent conversation is about how " massa ' s frenchie friends don ' unnastan ' aw corn " and who rubs herself against his front as she passes , right before maria ' s eyes ? 

even if we let that slide , it ' s followed by the horrifying revelation that sally was only 15 when this affair took place ( jefferson was 41 ) . strangely , this fact comes out only toward the very end , when sally ' s brother james is understandbly furious at her blase announcement that she is carrying jefferson ' s child . 

jefferson is equally blase when told that sally is carrying his child , and patronizingly tells her that she ' d be far better off under his protection than free and living in france with her brother . but , he promises , i ' ll free her when i die and our children ( including any more that come , jefferson says , in a chilling declaration of sally as * his * ) when they reach 21 . oh thank you , massa , you feel like telling the screen . big deal . 

the worst scene is still to come , however , involving jefferson ' s daughter patsy . she is already angry at him , first for breaking his vow , made to her mother on her deathbed , not to marry again . ( obviously the woman wasn ' t just talking about matrimony . ) jefferson has also refused to allow patsy to become a nun as she wishes , despite earlier moralizing about freedom of religion ( that seems to mean freedom to agree with him ) . 

having promised sally and her brother their freedom , jefferson calls in patsy to witness the bargain and promise to fulfill it should anything happen to him . sally ' s brother blurts out the impending birth of the child , and jefferson asks , " do you swear ? " paltrow ' s performance in this scene is brilliant , although she has almost nothing to say . her face nearly contorts in agonizing pain at this revelation , yet she controls her grief and whispers yes . 

if anything , and the filmmakers could have had something if they ' d emphasized this point more , " jefferson in paris " is an indication of the status of woman in the late 18th century , viewed even by men like jefferson as attractive property , pleasing but without true intellect or souls . we see jefferson shed a few tears over a letter from maria , obviously telling him where to get off , but he ' s soon laughing away at a wild dance from sally , complete with tossed hair and heaving bosom . 

i don ' t know whether this is an accurate portrait of jefferson or not . i don ' t care to watch it , however , just for the sake of watching it . this jefferson is no hero or even an anti-hero . he ' s a selfish , lying child-molestor--and one who gets away with it--not the kind of man i want to see a movie about .  love sublime says the title . another blurb during the promotions of the film talked about inner vs external beauty . well in this case the beauty - you decide inner or external - is provided by scantily clad ( or is that scantily dressed / undressed ) zeenat aman who the director raj kapoor called " a volcano of talent " while the film was being made . one can ' t accuse him of sarcasm of course - after all he was promoting his own film . 

the paper thin plot is about a woman with a disfigured face who has a - er - well proportioned body , a great voice ( thanks to lata mangeshkar ) with whom the hero shashi kapoor falls in love . he doesn ' t want her face only her voice . the acting is desperate and even the 4 is because of the music with lata mangeshkar giving some good numbers . the rest is of course bunkum . avoid - save your money . inner beauty vs outer beauty . ! ! ! you need not be an einstein to figure out which one the director was concentrating on this is a little slow-moving for a horror movie , but the quality is better than you might expect for a director ' s only effort on imdb . the camera work and lighting were both surprisingly good , and the acting Â although variable Â is better than is often found in indie genre flicks . 

as the lead , robert field is rather stiff , which is especially unfortunate given that his character , claude , is the film ' s narrator as well as the centre of its action . however , it was the entry of christopher ( brandon despain ) that i considered the turning point of this film Â and not in a good way . a twist is introduced in a clumsy fashion , and slow-moving becomes drawn out and overly wordy . 

on the up side , pete barker is consistently entertaining as father william . he ' s the easy stand-out in what is a fairly ordinary offering . while the first half hour caught my interest , i ended up feeling quite disappointed in the way things played out .  carlos is perhaps not the most original comic , but the first series was amusing , his forthright comments and observations were fresh . i missed a couple of seasons , but after all of the allegations of stealing material i caught a couple of episodes of the mind of mencia at the end of july 07 . a bit of a change i see ! carlos is much more into toilet humor and sex jokes than the race observations . in one episode he sort of implied he was in the same league as chris rock and dave chappelle . i think not . perhaps comedy central will give him one more season , but episodes i saw sounded tired and samey with more words beeped out than the osbournes . carlos , go back to stand-up for a couple of years , get some fresh material and try again .  this film gives a look at the suffering a family experiences at the death of a child , and the healing that can finally come to them . 

the family learns of the death of their son on christmas eve , 1991 , ruining the christmas season for them . they do not celebrate it again for many years . there is an interesting comment by the daughter that will remind viewers to consider the needs of surviving children in such a situation . 

the matthew character makes a reference to jesus , but i suspect that other comments he makes come from non-christian sources . i wonder if any other viewers would recognize those comments . if so , it would be an interesting addition to the data on this movie .  a washed up reporter called bart crosbie ( pat o ' brien ) blackmails gang boss heinz webber ( george colouris ) for the money to pay for his son to have a life saving operation . in return he agrees to turn himself in for the murder of his editor , whom the gang killed in order to prevent an incriminating story being printed about them . 

typical poverty-row b-pic of the time directed for far more than it ' s worth by terence fisher , who within months of making this would become one of the leading british horror film directors at the hammer studio . the script is far-fetched and teen idol tommy steele ( guitar in hand ) was drafted in to sing a poor rock and roll number called " the rebel " at a coffee bar that acts as a legitimate front for the gang ' s activities .  i found this an awfully disappointing experience ! but i have appended a better option of similar style at the foot of this entry . 

this " felicia ' s journey " is intriguing . it has drama . but it is full of stereo-types ! 

so it only serves judgemental temperaments without concern for truer justice & fairness & truth , beyond black ' n ' white judgements that fit 30-second ads of " news " that dot our multimedia experiences everyday , especially news bulletins , true or misleading in such depictions ! 

it is so exaggerated , it reminds me of the fairytale of " little red ridinghood " ! consider the innocent young girl with no identification crossing borders questioned by a guard but freed without any evidence to venture on in search of her ' romeo ' who didn ' t give her an address versus the pathetically inept lack of substance in the raspy voice of the ' helping hand ' befriending her with his unlikely story fabricated by the layer ! 

it seems to suit the directors & management team that no-one has faith or prays to god , even in their times of desperation ! 

so in these early settings , it orchestrates & tells much of what is to come ! a nightmare journey that betrays the essence of substance without fairytale resolution , without truth or integrity or credibility ! . . . then one twist & it ' s all over . what a disappointment ! if you want to see a much superior movie that investigates similar themes with much more credibility , with much more powerful insight , watch the 1983 paul cox / norman kaye " man of flowers " movie ! ! ! 

unlike here , you will not be disappointed !  brass pictures ( movies is not a fitting word for them ) really are somewhat brassy . their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class tv commercials . but unfortunately brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours ! in this they fail miserably , their undeniable , but rather soft and flabby than steamy , erotic qualities non withstanding . 

senso ' 45 is a remake of a film by luchino visconti with the same title and alida valli and farley granger in the lead . the original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around venice during the italian wars of independence . brass moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century , 1945 to be exact , so there are mussolini murals , men in black shirts , german uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans . but it is just window dressing , the historic context is completely negligible . 

anna galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral ss guy who always puts on too much lipstick . she is an attractive , versatile , well trained italian actress and clearly above the material . her wide range of facial expressions ( signalling boredom , loathing , delight , fear , hate . . . and ecstasy ) are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars . she endures this basically trashy stuff with an astonishing amount of dignity . i wish some really good parts come along for her . she really deserves it .  originally , the spiders was planned as a four-part serial , and it shows . i dislike serials ; they ' re typically ridiculous , convoluted and banal . this one is no exception . in the first part of the spiders , ' the golden lake , ' a rich adventurer thwarts the plans of a gang of criminals--the spiders--to steal gold from incas . a silly love triangle ensues , with some cowboys and indians action . the sensationalism and exotica of it didn ' t entertain me . 

one can legitimately trace themes from this two-part series to lang ' s later , far superior work . and , the film-making is better than in other serials i ' ve seen from this time , including ' les vampires ' ( 1915 ) . in the spiders , the camera isn ' t as static , and this film is fast paced , thankfully . the tinting and lighting are adequate , too . none of that ' s remarkable , though . it ' s nearly unseemly , however , in how closely this series resembles louis feuillade ' s serials ; the criminal gang dresses and behaves like those in ' les vampires ' --only the names , and to a lesser extent , the situations have changed . 

for the further comments on the spiders series , see the web pages for it .  the core issues at play ( god & satan / good & evil ) can be & should be tremendously compelling ( as demonstrated through thousands of works of art / music / literature / film ) . end of days , unfortunately , is nothing but a 2dimensional cartoon . byrne ' s acting ability stands so obviously in sharp contrast to arnold ' s corresponding lack of ability and is further underlined by a plot filled with nothing but stereotypes . 

the single compelling scene occurs at the very beginning with the transformation of the gabriel byrne character and his subsequent interaction with his wife ? girlfriend ? it is both erotically charged & repellent -- modernizing the vampirish themes , the seductive power of evil .  there is nothing like an oscar wilde comedy , and this movie is nothing like a comedy . the melodrama labors from scene to scene and the comedy is completely absent . in the original story , the humor comes from the americans who are oblivious to the ghostly traditions of canterville chase . the american father even offers some oil to the ghost to quiet the creaking chains . read the book !  no doubt about it , rampling is gorgeous -- a classic beauty , here very young . she manages to appear simultaneously sophisticated and poignant . her two male foils act well too . but seen in 2003 , the flic is all

american-trying-to-be-artsy-and-not-be-hollywood-while-shooting-beautiful-sh ots-of-the-french-riviera-and-three-pretty-young-people-in-their-cute-old-ca r . i enjoyed the view ( both the actors and the nature ) but the movie is boring and pretentious while trying to be the opposite .  a cbs radio program entitled " we the people " assists in finding an american home for vienna refugee charles coburn ( as karl braun ) , a skilled surgeon and pool hustler . he arrives with beautiful daughter sigrid gurie ( as leni ) , who is " studying " to become a nurse . relocated to a small , dusty midwestern village , they are welcomed at the station by burly john wayne ( as john phillips ) and his uncle spencer charters ( as ' nunk ' atterbury ) , a veterinarian . ms . gurie is unhappy in the dustbowl , and wants to leave . immediately . but , the prospect of romance with mr . wayne might change her mind . . . 

god answers the citizens ' many prayers for rain , but it may not be enough to save the farming town . the entire town is advised to relocate to oregon . wayne wants to stay and tough it out . coburn receives an invitation to work at a top clinic . and , gurie learns her fiancÃ© , presumed dead , will be arriving to claim her as his wife . she feels duty-bound to accept ; but , he has a dark secret . . . this film does not flatter wayne , who seems way out of his element . being paired with gurie , promoted as another garbo , doesn ' t help . they do have a cute scene in wayne ' s car ( " jalopy , an italian car " ) . 

 * * * * three faces west ( 7 / 3 / 40 ) bernard vorhaus ~ john wayne , sigrid gurie , charles coburn , spencer charters to be honest , i ' ve never been to the congo or even africa , and after watching the made for television movie heart of darkness , i do not think i ' d want to . the movie completely shames the book to the highest level possible . though the book was not the best i have read , after watching the movie , i seemed to appreciate the book a hundred times more . nicolas roeg , the director of the movie , did a horrible job portraying joseph conrad ' s novella into a movie . i give roeg some credit for trying to attempt the impossible by making the book into a movie , but this may not have been the job for him . the movie was unsuccessful to express any part of the novella other than the basics of the plot . the set and scenery also lacked the beauty conrad portrayed of africa in the book . in the book marlow had seen so many great wonders , but in the movie you did not get that same experience . no , i ' m not blaming everything on the director ; the acting in the film was just terrible . all of the actors were dull and uninteresting . throughout the whole movie i felt as if the actors were not putting forth any emotions , as if they were reading from the script the entire time . tim roth , who plays marlow , did not portray marlow ' s sense of adventure for his journey into the congo well . marlow ' s journey to find kurtz was supposed to venturesome , but i didn ' t experience that in the movie . i would not recommend watching this movie , especially if you have read the book already . it does not come close to doing justice for joseph conrad ' s novella . conrad ' s words capture the reader and take them on the journey with marlow , on his quest to find mr . kurtz , where as the film did not . a great novella , but a very poor film . heart of darkness , the movie , is based on the book written by joseph conrad also called heart of darkness .  in trying to keep up with the hipness of youthful audiences as the 70s approached , oacd , ycsf was the product of odder and odder material selected for musicalization . here it ' s past life regression , esp and hypno-therapy . . . pretty loopy ! the real problem with the concept ( music or not ) are the extraordinarily low dramatic stakes ; just where can a movie go , and what can happen , when a man falls in love with a previous incarnation of a girl he can ' t stand ? it can ' t go any place new , but strangely , it can ' t even go any place old ! indeed , if it could , audiences would still have no interest in the union of yves montand ( playing a much older , arrogant , french ass ) and streisand . ( a much younger girl ) . we never become invested in them , their situations or outcomes . montand is miscast and his strong accent makes many of his lyrics unintelligible . 

it ' s all been given a shallow 60s veneer that makes it eminently disposable ; despite efforts here and there from minelli that are respectable . it ' s not even adapted from a non-musical story that met with any previous success . . . that ' s just too passe ! streisand occasionally has some funny business to offer , as when she ' s trying not to fall asleep on her roof and improvises an energetic dance . but she over-relies on her ingratiating ( translation : irritating ) kooky , jewish girl shtick . she can however sing very well , at both the " gentle " and " powerhouse " ends of the range . amidst a score of musical dross , she gets 3 or 4 amazing songs * of much higher caliber than anything fanny or dolly had to offer . ' he isn ' t you ' is a sweet trifle as sublime as lorenz hart ' s ' my funny valentine , ' but the movie isn ' t able to realize any impact from it ; because the lyrics don ' t seem to be referring to anything in the movie , and nothing remotely suggests a great love is blossoming between chabot and melinda . 

the only cut we can view is a poor hatchet job of a much bigger film . strong research shows a longer , better-explained and more decorative , but not necessarily a better film at : http : / / barbra-archives . com / films / clear_day_streisand_2 . html . you can be sure there ' s be more babs in that version but more importantly , there ' d be more thoughtful work from minelli . 

in the end montand sends babs off to sing the title song , after she discovers he ' s a total dick who feeds her a self-esteem homily to allow himself off the hook . and she takes the bait . so , uh . . . hooray for that . 

 ( * hurry it ' s lovely up here , love with all the trimmings , he isn ' t you , & the title song )  this feels like a feature-lenght treatment of a comedy-routine that could have also been told in a ten-minute short . also , technical credits are sup-par . the film really feels like a film school diploma project . 

the cast is a mix of seasoned stage pros and talented newcomers but the problems is the superficial scrip . their lines feel constructed , exactly like cued tv show material . 

the director fails to take his protagonists seriously , therefore we are not touched by their problems and conflicts . 

the film has been cleverly marketed and offers a unique selling point , but in the end the film disappoints on all levels .  warner brothers social responsibility at its most ham-handed , with sermonizing every five minutes or so about how we ' re americans , we don ' t run from trouble , we face up to our responsibilities . it also suggests that if you ' re willing to perjure yourself to protect your family from clearly deadly gangsters , you ' re un-american . walter huston , looking bored , is the frustrated da , and the " average american family " includes such familiar faces as sally blane ( looking a lot like her sister , loretta young ) and dickie moore , as an allegedly adorable moppet . both are regularly crowded out of the frame by chic sale , only 47 then but playing an octogenarian civil war veteran , ponderously jumping and " amusingly " nipping at prohibition hooch and moralizing about how we ' re americans , dag nabbit . his st . vitus dance old-coot performance is tiresome schtick ; it ' s like walter brennan based his entire career on it . william wellman directs efficiently and quickly , much like his earlier " public enemy , " but he and the screenwriter neglect to show what happens to this family after the happy fadeout -- i . e . , they ' d probably be rubbed out by the mob .  luchino visconti was and is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation , but adam low ( the director of this thing ) allows the stronger voice to be helmut berger ' s ! how can it be ? what a missed opportunity ! we come out of this ordeal knowing less of what made the master great and more about the things one shouldn ' t care at all . the beautiful images belong to visconti ' s world , the embarrassing interviews to the likes of berger and zeffirelli to adam low ' s tiny little world . a must to avoid !  i went out of my way to get this film , and was fortunate to get it on vhs . being a big gloria grahame fan , it was an excellent addition to my collection . other than that , i really cannot say a lot to recommend this picture . the plot is predictable ( and weak ) and the only interesting aspect of the film is watching sterling hayden get into deeper trouble with his own department . ms . grahame is always fun to watch ( if you like her , as i do ) , but the dubbing of her singing hurts this picture a lot . she works in a dive , so let her use her own voice . it can only lend to the atmosphere . i must agree with an earlier reviewer ; the ending borrows heavily from the big heat . to the point of detracting from the ending . i have seen worse films with ms . grahame ( macao ) , but i will never pass the opportunity to see her on screen . if you are having a movie night and looking for a second feature film , this is your movie . enjoy the picture .  this movie starts off on the wrong foot and never really gets it going . the first scene shows a life flight helicopter landing and just outside the window you can distinctly see mountains in the background . for those of you who might not ever have been to houston there is no elevation change . the city sits just above sea level and a 5 ft . incline is considered a big hill . to go along with that scenery , any shots outside of the hospital immediately tell the viewer that they are not in houston . the trees are all missing leaves or are pine trees , neither of which houston has very much of . even the hospital itself , on the outside , is very unbelievable . memorial hermann hospital is one of the top hospitals in the united states and sits smack dab in the middle of the medical district just miles from downtown houston , yet every outside shot of the hospital makes it appear that the hospital is out in the suburbs or even the countryside . 

it is obvious that whoever was in charge of the actual tropical storm part of the movie skimped out because the numerous shots of radar are all wrong . the first radar image in the movie is that of hurrican hugo hitting south carolina . we later see kris kristofferson leaving his job and one of his assistants tells him that alison is moving back south across houston yet the radar image he shows has alison clearly moving north off of the gulf of mexico into houston . . . probably the initial landfall of alison . 

as for the acting , it isn ' t all that bad . jobeth williams , kris kristofferson and rick schroder all do a decent job considering that this is a straight-to-tv movie . the plot of the story is decent and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it a bit more entertaining . my one problem with the acting is the portrayal of houstonians with big thick southern accents . . . the actors all sound like they are from birmingham , alabama and not houston , texas . 

the movie gets its point across and to the general audience it does exactly what it is meant to : entertain . if you are looking for a factual account of what happened to the city of houston in june of 2001 then you will be disappointed . one thing to keep in mind before viewing this movie is that it is based solely on the evacuation of memorial hermann hospital and not on tropical storm alison and the impact on houston metro itself . if you are looking for a factual account of tropical storm alison ' s impact on houston metro might i suggest watching the weather channel ' s storm stories for tropical storm alison . 

 * 1 / 2 out of * * * * *  stu ungar is considered by many to be the greatest poker / gin player of all time - an extraordinary self-destructive force of nature - tiny in stature , but a huge heart for the game . 

what we have here is a kind of hallmark film about the dangers of gambling . sure , he wins , he loses , he blows it all on sex , drugs , and more gambling we get it , but where is the real play - where is what made him the greatest card player of all time . 

much too flat , and frankly boring in places , this gets a four because we get to learn something about stu the man , but stu the card player , nada . 

nicely shot and presented up to a point this is the perfect example of how not to make a film about cards : honestly , espn ' s coverage of the world series is more watchable than this . 

a waste of a great chance .  beloved tale of hero " benji " ( " higgins " the dog ) who is many different things to many different people . in his busy day " benji " grabs breakfast at the house of two young children , has a chat with an officer of the law , chases an old lady ' s cat and reminds an aging cafÃ© owner to start on the day ' s special . helper to some , amusement to others , he is companion to all . 

trouble arises when his young friends are kidnapped and taken to the abandoned mansion that he calls home . from here on we know only " benji " can save the day . 

plot is routine from writer / producer / director joe camp , and he does tend to over do the slow motion effects . audiences though will find it hard to resist the lovable little pooch , and kids of all ages are sure to adore him . cast were never going to be anything but background to " benji " . 

not what you ' d call inspired , but fun family fare . academy award nominee for " benji ' s " theme , " i feel love " . 

saturday , july 13 , 1996 - video andrew gurland ' s " cheats " is his fictionalized " true story " about four high school friends who maneuver to cheat on tests . the quartet are : supercilious school-hating trevor fehrman ( as handsome davis ) , his likewise good-looking pal matthew lawrence ( as victor ) , their chubby school-hating chum elden henson ( as sammy ) , and crooked geekster martin starr ( as applebee ) . the adults include high-strung north point principal mary tyler moore ( as mrs . stark ) and pornography-loving father griffin dunne ( as mr . davis ) . the high jinks begin with mr . fehrman and mr . lawrence supposedly urinating on a teacher ' s grade book . put this one at the bottom of the pile ; and , be thankful it doesn ' t go on anyone ' s permanent record . 

 * * * cheats ( 2002 ) andrew gurland ~ trevor fehrman , matthew lawrence , elden henson this series doesn ' t present the british view of the revolutionary war , so much as an anti-american view of it . the underlying theme of the series is that a silent majority of colonists enjoyed british rule ; that the founding fathers were manipulative schemers whose only goal was to draw britain into a violent civil war ; that the american supporters of the revolution and the militia were racist , violent louts , duped into the struggle . clearly , the intent of the author , richard holmes , is for the viewer to extrapolate these characteristics , in a straight line , from the american population of 1775 to today . 

for example , in the episode " the shot heard around the world " holmes dredges up an obscure print of the boston massacre , in which he claims the skin of crispus attucks , a black man and the first man killed in the revolution , was purposely " whited out " . holmes claims that portraying attucks as a black man would have been bad propaganda for the revolutionary cause . holmes never reveals how he knows this . and there ' s more . holmes goes to some length to work in a single , unsubstantiated , atrocity : the desecration of the body of a british soldier . he compares the american militia to the viet cong and the mujahadeen -- without mentioning any differences in the goals of these groups . the list goes on . 

supposedly , this series was made in response to mel gibson ' s " the patriot " . it says a lot when an academic feels the need to respond to mel gibson on any topic . instead of presenting the british view , it seems holmes really wanted to give a sensationalistic , anti-american view , and , in the process , he ' s made himself the roger corman of historians -- strictly third-rate schlock .  boston blackie movies have some strengths -- mostly in that the pacing is swift and the hero is cheerfully unfazed in even the worst circumstances . but the plotting is frequently atrocious , and the unrelenting comic bits often kill the pacing ( if the plot happens to be atypically good ) or are just unfunny and inappropriate . 

this one involves blackie chasing an escapee from the asylum ( steve cochran in a really poor performance ) who has become fixated on beautiful nina foch ( who puts in a nice , rather subtle acting job ) . inspector farraday , of course , believes blackie has gone homicidal maniac ( he at least has some evidence in this one for that ) , and is incompetently trying to jail him as blackie goes after the real killer . the plot has possibilities , but any time any real tension gets going , we a get a not funny comedy routine . it doesn ' t seem like anyone at columbia understood that , in a movie about a pursuit of a really dangerous maniac , cute little comedy scenes about hiding an inconvenient body from the inspector disrupt any willing suspension of disbelief . ( one just concludes our clever hero is an idiot -- deadly for a film like this . ) 

this one is not worth the time . for a well plotted episode of this series , see alias boston blackie .  this is a case of taking a fairy tale too far . the enchanted cottage delivers dorothy mcguire as a " terrible ugly " spinster and robert young as a disfigured pilot . long story short : scarface marries spinster , after which their love transforms them , miraculously ( lighting , cosmetics and the removal of fake scars ) , into beautiful peopleÂa magical change that they attribute to the enchantment of living in a seaside cottage that has been the abode of generations of honeymooners . 

if the story stopped there , fine ; it would be a fable with a proverbial message : beauty is in the eye of the beholder . but it lurches ahead , reaching for reality . when mr . and mrs . scarface greet their public , it comes as a painful shock to them that they ' re still homely . you see , they only appear beautiful to each otherÂ a situation which the audience is well prepared for because all the secondary characters have been sermonizing that ill-favored people really need to lower their expectations , and find other ways to be happy . you know . take up hobbies . spinster does woodcuts , for instance . scarface considers collecting driftwood . 

the original playwright ( arthur wing pinero ) and the filmmakers have zero faith in human nature . their message is : you ' re either ugly or pretty , and no pretty person would ever love an ugly one . what ' s even worse , ugly people evidently need to imagine their lover as pretty . reality just won ' t do . 

one wonders what elaine mason saw every day when she looked at her husband , stephen hawking .  chuck jones ' s ' odor-able kitty ' is the cartoon that introduced pepe le pew to the world sort of . there are a few key differences between the pepe we know and love ( or hate , in the case of some people ) and the character in this cartoon . for one , the disguised cat who pepe amorously pursues in ' odor-able kitty ' is distinctly male . also , pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is henry at the cartoon ' s climax , his french accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up . pepe is not even the lead character here , the focus favouring the put-upon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies . for the most part , the storyline largely follows the usual format of a pepe le pew cartoon but pepe ' s aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character . he is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated . in fact , ' odor-able kitty ' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round . its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every pepe le pew cartoon that followed . this subsequent development has robbed ' odor-able kitty ' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull pepe le pew short with a weird surprise ending . as a child , i hated pepe le pew . as an adult , able to appreciate his more sophisticated , verbal and risquÃ© humour , i love the character and most of his cartoons . ' odor-able kitty ' makes me feel like a child again !  the reviewer in variety said this was " overwritten and overlong " , and i kind of agree with it . it has some events that seem forced and unlikely , like when cal ( crudup once again as the ' lost , vacant , and kind of dull ' male ) and julianne moore find a map of the us in kind of an unbelievable place . the story is one of those 1970 ' s " guy must find meaning in his life " stories , and i found myself imagining jack nicholson in his prime playing the role of cal . the whole " hitting the road to find meaning in life " theme is still kind of interesting though . does it all really lead back to family ? i wasn ' t so sure . the acting is okay , i particularly liked karen allen and james legross , who unfortunately only have supporting roles . i ' d give it a ' five ' .  i hesitated seeing this movie , having really enjoyed the original , ' mostly martha ' . what a disappointment . catherine zeta jones is a good actress but this wasn ' t her film . the original had poignant moments , perfectly punctuated with an incredible soundtrack . no reservations felt like it never connected . the food , the characters - nothing felt passionate . in mostly martha , the food came alive- every scene was filmed in such a way you could taste it with your eyes - the smells , the textures . the food in ' no reservations ' was in the background - rarely did we get a closeup of the preparation ; the characters were not real enough to carry the movie without it . it was hard finishing the movie - many of the scenes felt awkward . see the original - it ' s a truly enjoyable movie ; the soundtrack incredible .  had she not been married to the producer , jennifer jones would not have been the most obvious choice for the leading female role in this tragic tale of an affair between an american soldier and an english nurse , set against the backdrop of the first world war . her british accent is not perfect , and in the fifties it was unusual for a big romantic lead to go to an actress in her late thirties , even one as attractive as miss jones , especially when she was several years older than her leading man . . there were a number of beautiful young british actresses in hollywood around this time , such as audrey hepburn , elizabeth taylor , jean simmons and joan collins , any of whom might have been more convincing in the role , but miss jones had one important attribute they all lacked , namely a marriage certificate with david o . selznick ' s name on it . in the event , the film turned out to be such a turkey that they were doubtless grateful not to have it on their cvs . 

the film tells , at great length , the story of the romance between frederick , an american volunteer serving with the italian army as an ambulance driver and catherine , a nurse with the british red cross . after the italian defeat at the battle of caporetto , frederick is wrongly accused of being a german spy and sentenced to death . ( the film paints a very harsh picture of italian military justice ; it would appear that italian courts-martial had the power to pass the death sentence after a trial lasting all of thirty seconds without hearing any evidence and without allowing the defendant to be legally represented or to speak in his defence ) . frederick manages to escape and to cross the border into neutral switzerland , accompanied by the pregnant catherine . 

hemingway ' s novels have not always been a great success when filmed . howard hawks succeeded in making a good version of " to have and have not " , a film that is considerably better than the book on which it is nominally based , but that is because he largely ignored hemingway ' s plot and turned the film into a remake of " casablanca " , set in martinique rather than french morocco . like the 1943 version of " for whom the bell tolls " , " a farewell to arms " is overlong and fatally slow moving . it is also miscast . jennifer jones never makes catherine come to life . as for rock hudson , his assumed christian name could be unfortunately appropriate . he could be as solid as a rock but also as impassive as one , and in this film his frederick seems an impersonation of the great stone face . despite the passion and emotion inherent in hemingway ' s plot , the emotional temperature is always far too cool . the picture has little going for it apart from some attractive picture-postcard views of italian and swiss scenery . it is hardly surprising that it was not a success and that its failure ended selznick ' s career as a producer . 4 / 10

a goof . shortly before the battle of caporetto , an italian officer states that russia had already concluded a separate peace with germany . that battle started in october 1917 , at a time when kerensky ' s russia was still fighting alongside the allies . the russian revolution did not take place until november ; it was only the " october revolution " by the old julian calendar . the new bolshevik regime signed an armistice with germany in december 1917 , but a separate peace was not signed until the treaty of brest-litovsk in march 1918 the brilliant australian comic genius barry humphries had a rare failure with this uneven , and occasionally distasteful comedy , which was snatched back from release after only a few days . drunken , lecherous australian diplomat sir les patterson accidentally sets an arab potentate on fire at the un and is posted to his tiny country as punishment , arriving just as a palace coup puts a new leader ( american soap star thaao penghlis ) on the throne . sir les , with the reluctant help of dame edna everage ( both played by humphries ) almost accidentally foils a scheme by the new leader to release a deadly , disgusting , aids-like virus on the western world . joan rivers has a cameo as the female president of the united states , her desk plate reading " president rivers " ! extreme bad taste mingles with slapstick and humphries ' usual scathing satire in a film which is more enjoyable in it ' s many funny parts , than taken together as a whole . dame edna ' s tv fans may be puzzled by the presence of a different madge allsop , sadly , one who lacks emily perry ' s wonderful drab comedy magic in the role . the film was written by humphries & his third wife , diane millstead , and directed by the mad max man himself , george miller . for die-hard humphries fans like myself , essential . all others , beware .  matt cvetic is a loyal communist in a pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party , even though this isolates himself from his son , family , and neighbors . what makes this even more difficult is that cvetic is actually an fbi agent posing as a communist in order to obtain information about party activities . the party is trying to create a strike at the mill , whereby the pro-strike movement will lead the workers into a wave of propaganda . cvetic also has to contend with beautiful eve merrick , a party member and teacher at his son ' s school who finds the fact that cvetic is a double agent . when eve learns the ugly truth about the party ' s real motives , the reds decide she must be liquidated and cvetic must aid her without endangering himself . the film should have plenty of suspense and double crossing but there is very little in this film but ( by today ' s standards ) very cheesy propaganda and little action or thrills . lovejoy is very good in the main role , but even he and the rest of the cast seem listless . few surprises here and how did this film receive a oscar nod for best documentary ? rating , 4 .  sherlock holmes and the secret weapon starts in switzerland as the world ' s foremost detective sherlock holmes ( basil rathbone ) outwits the nazi ' s & manages to smuggle a brilliant scientist named dr . franz tobel ( william post jr . ) out of the country & to the relative safety of london . but is london as safe as holmes thinks ? dr . tobel has engineered a revolutionary new bomb sight that will change aerial bombardment forever & he has agreed to give it to the british government , but those nazi ' s want it just as badly & holmes arch enemy professor moriarty ( lionel atwill ) plans on stealing the secret of the bomb sight & selling it to the nazi ' s . add the bumbling inspector lestrade ( denis hoey ) of scotland yard , dr . tobel ' s love interest charlotte eberli ( kaaren verne ) , assassins , mysterious scientists & a puzzling coded message & holmes has his work cut out to keep dr . tobel alive so he can deliver his bomb sight . . . 

directed by roy william neill sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was the fourth in a series of fourteen holmes films made between 1939 & 1946 to feature rathbone & bruce as holmes & watson . the script by edward t . lowe jr . , scott darling & edmund l . hartmann is based on the short ' the dancing men ' by sir arthur conan doyle & isn ' t the tradition holmes murder mystery as it ' s more of a wartime adventure story . to neglect what holmes is all about , the solving of complex crimes & mysteries is a big mistake as far as i ' m concerned & the involvement of the nazi ' s & the war as a backdrop to the story feels out of place , awkward & just didn ' t sit too well with me . the dialogue isn ' t great , professor moriarty feels almost like an afterthought as if they couldn ' t come up with a villain for it & as a whole it ' s far less engaging than other ' s in the series . however , at least it ' s short . 

director neill does his usual efficient job but you have to cut it a little slack & bear in mind that it was made over 60 years ago . it has no real style or imagination & lacks both atmosphere & intrigue as well . 

technically the film is ok if unspectacular , the black and white cinematography is fine although i understand that a computer colourised version is also available . the acting is alright , bruce & hoey do their usual comic relief turns & rathbone ' s hairstyle in this looks ridiculous & i ' m glad he changed it for later instalments . 

sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was a disappointment when compared to some of the other excellent entries in the series , there is very little by which i can recommend it & everything that made the other ' s so good seems to be missing here . leave this one till last & watch some of the better ones first , for die hard fans only .   " imperium nero " is the second movie of the series of six productions named " imperium " . i have already unfavorably commented the first one : " imperium augustus " . this second tv movie produced and broadcast last weekend by the italian state owned network has the same defects . in addition contains a considerable number of historical errors . some examples : nero is a child and agrippina calls him : " nero , nero " . at that time is name was claudius . he was named nero after his adoption . nero did not meet acte when he was young as in the movie but after his marriage with octavia and his nomination to emperor . when becoming emperor his sons where not adults : britannicus is one month old and octavia one year old . and many many more . if you are fond of ancient roman history you can find yourselves other examples . " imperium " series will continue with four more movies : " titus " , " marcus aurelius " , " costantinus " and " the fall of the roman empire " . finally !  before i begin , let me get something off my chest : i ' m a huge fan of john eyres ' first film project : shadowchaser . the film , a b-grade cross of both the terminator & die hard , may not be the work of a cinematic genius , but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit ( & spawned two sequels & a spin off ) . 

judge and jury begins with joseph meeker , a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so-called " bloody shootout " ( which seems like a poor name for a killing spree Â meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store ) , being led to the electric chair . there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love ( who was killed during the shootout ) , expressing his revenge for the person who killed her Â michael silvano , a washed-up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team ( and ends up harassing his son ' s coach ) . but once executed , meeker returns as a revenant ( or as kelly perine calls " a hamburger without the fries " ) , whose sole aim is to get his revenge , which basically means making silvano ' s life a misery . 

let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film . it is a supernatural action film , with meeker chasing silvano , using his ability to change form ( which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator , a french chef ( with an accent as bad as his moustache ) , a drag queen , a clown & a stand-up comedian ) , a shotgun which fires explosive rounds & an invulnerability to death ( although that doesn ' t stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle ) , to pay silvano back for killing meeker ' s wife . 

director john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations , instead focusing solely on action scenes , which the film has plenty of . but that is the film ' s main flaw , since there ' s nothing to connect the action scenes together . the acting is surprisingly good , with keith delivering the best performance , supported ably by kove , as well as paul koslo , who plays the washed-up cop quite well . kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse .  this must rank as one of cinema ' s greatest debacles . i was wandering europe at the time and had the misfortune to stumble upon the crew making this movie in what was , even then , one of the world ' s idyllic , unspoiled settings . i was enlisted as an extra , and what followed was an exhibition of modern day debauchery . forget all the accusations you ' ve ever heard of peter mayall ' s intrusions on this rare piece of french life- geoff reeve and his cohorts embarked on a level of revelry at the restaurant at les beaux that left the maitre ' d slack-jawed in disbelief . they were , quite simply , awful , uncultured and undeserving of french hospitality .  although this movie has a slow , dream-like , almost mesmerizing pace , and an interesting , though possibly not entirely accurate , description of a rural french constabulary ' s criminal investigation practices and personnel , i find it , ultimately , impossible to recommend . i think this movie is simply a setup piece to advance one person ' s -- the director ' s , one presumes -- disgust with heterosexuality . certainly , human sexuality in all its forms can have their revolting moments , no denying that ! but to choose the bad uniformly at the expense of the good , as this film does at every turn , suggests a warped sensibility at work . in short , if you enjoy watching homo-eroticism masquerading as compassion , and the depiction of heterosexual lovemaking and the female form in a hideous and degrading light - then this movie is for you . i don ' t , and it wasn ' t .  even though this film was nothing special as such , i am drawn to comment on at least one factor that ruled in its favour - that of the lead female performer in the film , dyan cannon . in spite of the film ' s ridiculous storyline and what she goes through here , hers was the best acting job in the film , making the unbelievable seem more plausible . her raucous scene with the gay photographer david hemmings has to be seen to be believed . good work , dyan .  it seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for " the sopranos , " as its main character , martin blank ( john cusack ) is a hit man who has so many issues from his past and his profession that he ' s in therapy trying to deal with it all . everything finally comes to a head at his 10-year high school reunion . the problem was that by the time blank got to the reunion i had stopped caring . frankly , i found this movie a drag from start to finish . 

it had potential . there was a reasonably good cast , headed by cusack and dan aykroyd , playing grocer , his arch-rival in the hit-man business , along with minnie driver as debi , blank ' s high school sweetheart who he stood up on prom night , and a limited role for alan arkin as dr . oatman , blank ' s psychologist . that fairly talented cast never really seemed to come together , though . the drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked real humour . what i thought had the most potential to be a comedic storyline was grocer ' s proposal for a hit man ' s union , but aside from becoming a bit of a running joke , the idea never really got developed . as for the romance , one wondered why debi would even think of letting this guy back into her life . 

there were a handful of chuckles , but nothing really caught me and held me and i spent most of the movie wondering whether this thing was ever going to start to click . it never did - not for me , at least . 2 / 10 at the beginning of ' loggerheads ' , we ' re introduced to three pairs of seemingly unrelated characters . to make matters even more confusing , we ' re informed ( via titles on the screen ) that the action is taking place in three separate time lines ( between the years 1999 and 2001 ) . it takes a great deal of time but eventually we come to see how the three pairs are related : mark austin , a young man in his 20s , gay and hiv positive is estranged from his conservative parents , elizabeth and rev . robert austin . 

mark is now a drifter and arrives in kure beach , north carolina , a seaside town , where he meets george ( sensitively played by michael kelly ) , a gay motel owner and they eventually become involved with each other . meanwhile , mark ' s birth mother , grace ( played by bonnie hunt ) has come to the point in her life where she has decided to find the son she gave up for adoption when she was 17 . similarly , mark ' s adoptive mother , also has decided to track her estranged son as she misses him ( despite the misgivings of her homophobic minister husband ) . 

 ' loggerheads ' we ' re told is based on a true story and that perhaps is its achilles heel . director / writer tim kirkman tries too hard to create scenes fraught with dramatic tension where there is very little to be found . take mark and georgeÂthey ' re both sensitive souls who have little to disagree about . there ' s some slight tension when grace faces off against an adoption agency director who is forbidden by law to give her any information about her lost son as well as a slight conflict with her mother who denies that she disapproved of her when she became pregnant as a teenager . no sparks fly either between elizabeth and robert since the good reverend has adamantly insisted from the beginning that he has no intention of reconciling with his son . 

 ' loggerheads ' is similar to ' brokeback mountain ' in that the gay couple are the good guys and the straight males ( for example , the kure beach cop and the reverend ) are the baddies . the biggest letdown of the movie is that there is no interaction ( and hence no dramatic conflict ) between mark and either one of his ' mothers ' . mark is already dead before either the birth or adoptive mother has a chance to reconcile with him . 

kirkman ' s theme is both a plea for tolerance and an exhortation for family members to express their heartfelt feelings before it ' s too late ! kirkman ' s sentiments are for the most part well-intentioned but they do not make for good drama . loggerheads moves along at a snail ' s pace without providing any new revelations ( or suspense ) regarding such topics as aids , adoption and homophobia . ultimately ' loggerheads ' fails due to a lack of originality .  evan almighty continues the mainstream bruce almighty franchise , this time with newsman turned freshman congressman from buffalo , evan baxter ( steve carell ) , at it ' s center . a wholly innocuous ( and not even really self-doubting ) man , god ( morgan freeman ) decides to enforce some sort of quest upon baxter , in order to illustrate the importance of . . . reciprocal kindness , so that baxter can " change the world " ( aka , pay it forward ) . 

think of evan almighty as a wholesome derivative of ' distinguished gentlemen . ' baxter is not a con , but his colleague , congressman long ( john goodman ) wants his unquestioned support on a bill that essentially , is harmful to the environment . and well-meaning baxter , knowing the importance of networking and visibility , is willing to support him . 

in addition , with the new job comes more responsibility , and baxter is in a sense , vilified , for not spending enough time with his family . 

so god , decides to give evan baxter some guidance by forcing him to become the modern day noah . his orders : build an ark . except , while it may be mildly humorous to see baxter ' s transformation to the " weirdo with a beard-o , " there doesn ' t seem to be much point to this whole thing which becomes abundantly clearer when the climax of the film fizzles . ( spoilers : if none of the population is killed by the " flood " , then what was the point of summoning the animals . . . or at least the ones that obviously weren ' t from suburban virginia ? or , more importantly , if all baxter had to realize was that long ' s projects faltered in their quality , then why did he have to build an ark ? ) . 

so , although a comedy like this needn ' t be a hysterical laugh-riot , it was certainly one made far less enjoyable as it was crammed with far too many homilies ( and not all from morgan freeman ) and action that seemed intended for a film of more epic events .  jeff morrow is leslie gaskell , barbara laurence is vera hunter , and john emory is hubbel eliot . along with some ancillary air force personnel and a comic geek , they are in charge of a super-secret underground laboratory on the west coast . morrow is thrilled when he discovers a meteor passing through the atmosphere but nonplussed when the meteor decides to take a dip in the pacific ocean and emerge as a fantastic machine on the mexican coast . 

nobody knows what this colossal , blocky structure is . obviously it ' s some kind of carpentered artifact because it ' s all made up of right angles with a kind of bald sphere half visible on top . 

it turns out that the machine , dubbed kronos , is from some far-away planet and has been sent here to rob the earth of energy . you see , here on earth , we have learned how to convert matter into energy , but on kronos ' planet they have figured out the other half of the equation -- how to convert energy into matter . and now they ' re running out of energy on the other planet . are you taking notes on this ? good . 

maybe you ' ll be able to fill me in on some of the scientific questions raised by kronos ' mission . for instance , if kronos ' builders can convert energy into matter and vice versa , why don ' t they just convert a little of their own spare matter into energy instead of sending elaborate machines to earth to extinguish la ' s lights ? but it ' s doubtful the writers could explain it either . reversing the polarities of two antenna is described as an " anthropic conversion , " which means a " towards-human change " , which doesn ' t make sense . but it doesn ' t seem that any of the science makes sense for that matter . the diagram that morrow draws on the board has the current going in the wrong direction , from positive to negative . 

there ' s a problem with kronos ' locomotion too . it marches along the coast , threatening " populated areas " ( read southern california ) , but it has no joints in its two or three legs . these stumps just thump slowly up and down , squashing some people . the film doesn ' t make much of these squashed people . they ' re shown as mexican peasants , so maybe they don ' t count for too much . the usaf also drops a hydrogen bomb on kronos -- while it ' s in mexico , mind you . nobody raises an eyebrow . 

not much acting is called for and not much is given . jeff morrow has a distinct and resonant voice , great for radio or for tv voice overs . his face is less expressive . he has only one expression , no matter what the situation is -- a tight smile , as if he ' s having his picture taken at the universal studios tour . barbara laurence had a fine , golden quality when she made " street with no name " a few years earlier . she was a slender seventeen-year-old as richard widmark ' s wife . here , her grooming and demeanor reduce her to the level of b-movie actress , though she ' s still beautiful . it ' s always good to see morris ankrum in one of these movies . he ' s made so many , i get them mixed up . 

on the whole , the film comes across as flat , i ' m afraid . ( there are some nice shots of a b-47 in flight , though . ) the sets reveal a low-budget enterprise . that ' s not necessarily bad in itself , but there ' s nothing to make up for the barren settings . little tension in the script , no directorial display , and little effort put into the performances . 

you might get a kick out of it -- a relaxed high -- because this is distinctly unchallenging . it ' s just that there are so many better films of the genre out there .  enjoy the opening credits . they ' re the best thing about this second-rate but inoffensive time-killer which features passable performances from the likes of eric roberts and martin kove . the main part , however , goes to newcomer tommy lee thomas who looks a bit diminutive for this kind of action but who , nevertheless , occasionally manages to project a banty-rooster kind of belligerence . the first time we see him he ' s bare-chested , sweaty , and engaged in that favorite " beefcake " activity -- chopping wood . after this he has seven more scenes without his shirt including one in which he ' s hanged by his wrists and zapped with electricity a la mel gibson in " lethal weapon . " he could use a better script , however , since the manner in which he exposes the truth about corruption and violence inside the prison is never very convincing . there ' s also talk about millions of dollars which apparently is tied in with this investigation but which is never explained . there are a few pluses , though . sending " john woodrow " undercover as " john wilson " is an amusing play on a presidential name , and co-star jody ( ross ) nolan shows promise as an inmate who , early in the proceedings , is shown hanged by his wrists and getting punched by a burly guard . one final note : the movie ' s low budget is painfully responsible for the lack of " extras . " despite the impressive size of the prison , it only seems to hold about 12 inmates ! ( note : the cast credits at the end aren ' t too helpful . for the record , the burly , bald-headed guard who uses jody nolan as a punching bag is played by bill fishback , and the young , fair-haired guard who administers electric shocks to tommy lee thomas is played by marc chenail . )  how could a film dealing with illegal mexican immigrants being robbed and beaten over the border be dull ? well , " border incident " is . 

no wonder that song and dance man george murphy ' s career ended not long after this terrible film came out . politics was certainly a way out for this future senator who dies a horrible death in this slowly paced film . the film stereotypes the typical mexican migrant farmer worker as dimwitted and awfully dull . 

the film only picks up in intensity once the identities of murphy and ricardo montalban have been discovered as federal agents for the u . s . and mexico respectively . 

disappointing at best , we see similar problems in our very own society today .  the poet carne disappears ( didnÂ´t he disappeared with prÃ©vert ? ) and is followed by the judge carne . the director wants to give his own vision of a youth that he doesnÂ´t understand and he doesnÂ´t want to . itÂ´s a long way from the wonderful " les enfants du paradis " ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  not finding the right words is everybody ' s problem in this vaudeville-type urban comedy . they don ' t know what to say , and they don ' t know how to say it , which is why they embark on the potentially humiliating enterprise of pre-arranged speed dating . unfortunately , they all come across as cardboard characters rather than real people . the story follows a conventional three-act structure : getting to know the sizable cast in their sorry single lives , the actual dating circuit , and a final stretch of romantic fallout , showcasing some of the new-found couples ' follies . because it ' s all so predictable , i ' d say that as a narrative , " shoppen " is a failure . as a comedy , most of the time it ' s too goofy to be really funny . thumbs up to kathrin von steinburg . she stands out from the soap opera crowd as the aloof , independently wealthy miriam . great makeup on her too ( verena weiÃert ) : heavy eye shadow meets skin-tone lip gloss , creating a brooding and bohemian , yet girlish effect . thumbs up also to stefan zinner as the bavarian love machine and tanja schleiff as the hot nutritionist . they bypass the communication challenge by way of the timeless body language of copulation .  this must be one of mgm ' s and frank sinatras worst films . an oddball musical comedy that fails in almost every aspect . silly plot has sinatra trying to carry on his fathers reputation as a kissing bandit . he ' s no bandit and doesn ' t kiss ! ! he does play the " nerdy " character as well as could be expected given the dialog he has to speak . the scene stealer ' s are j . carroll nash and mildred natwick . too bad they didn ' t have more scenes together . i ' ve given the film two stars because the sets and costumes are superior and one of the songs sung by kathtren grayson " love is where you find it " , is sensational . could have had a repirse of that one . also , a comic type dance number by ridcardo mantalban , cyd charisse and ann miller if fun . so for those reasons and those reasons only , it is watchable . kissing bandit is part of the frank sinatra early years collection .  this movie moved much too slowly for my taste . the concept of the story is refreshingly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally-retarded family member in a way that i have not previously seen on-screen . however , the execution of the concept was flawed . each character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearance , then one had to endure the feeling that each character was treading water the rest of the way . that is , each character flailed about awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the movie , which i found to be a form of emotional and social retardation . i suppose this has artistic merit , given the irony that the story centers around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way above-average intelligence friends and family . the acting , however , was well-done without exception . i agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautiful . in summary , i think the film has strong artistic merit because of the fine acting and cinematography , but fails on an emotional level due to the shortcomings described .  this is the dreary tale of the self absorbed affair between two unlikable people , one of whom is married to someone else . it ranks high on my list of most boring movies ever , and i ' m a die hard romantic . my husband opted out after the first hour of its three , by which time little had transpired . the desert scenery is spectacular , with the endless sand and the sunshine on katharine ' s golden hair . however , cinematography does not a brilliant film make , unless it ' s a national geographic travelogue . the magnificent saharan scenery in this ill conceived tale is like putting perfume on a pig . 

the movie revolves around a badly burned , dying pilot named count laszlo de almasy , who is left in the care of a canadian army nurse , hana , during world war ii italy . he appears to remember little of his life but through a book in his possession , his story is very slowly revealed , with the help of a man from his past named caravaggio , who mysteriously appears at his deathbed . almasy was a hungarian cartographer employed by the royal geographical society to chart the sahara desert . he entered into an affair with the wife , katherine , of a fellow explorer who proved to be a british spy . meanwhile in the present , laszlo ' s nurse has her own affair with a sikh nicknamed kip , who is involved in the dangerous work of disarming mines . 

my quarrels with this movie are many , length and tedium for starters . i don ' t fault the acting in particular , it simply isn ' t a good story . caravaggio seems unnecessary , his connection to almasy sketchy . he provides a torture scene but appears to serve no essential purpose in the film . 

the core problem is that the two parties of this affair , almasy and katharine , are woefully unsympathetic characters , shallow and dull . they simply aren ' t very nice , thus there is no one to cheer for . almasy is cool , aloof , haughty , and eventually disgustingly possessive of another man ' s wife . katharine is likewise detached and nasty , not to mention having a deplorable lack of guilt or feeling whatsoever for her imperfect but loving husband . . . apart from managing one minuscule tear at the corner of her eye when he dies . 

this is a tale of lust rather than love , with such pearls as ' i can still taste you ' . almasy ridiculously vocalizes to a colleague his erotic obsession with the indentation in his beloved ' s neck , surely more indicative of a focus on katharine ' s body . the victim of this unrepentant adultery is the hapless husband , geoffrey , who is treated as little more than an unpleasant nuisance . it ' s all quite sordid and disgusting , katharine ' s charade of feeling faint so that these lovers can indulge in their much vaunted unbridled passion , all as silent night is being sung in the background . i ' m not sure whether the intent was to contrast the carol ' s purity with their selfish lust , but i definitely was not impressed by the sacrilegious undertone . we have full frontal nudity with katharine , but their sex scenes come across as cold , selfish , lustful , and sometimes downright hateful . . . not warm , loving , giving , nor even truly passionate . if either of these two feels any emotion for the other , it is a totally selfish one and definitely not love , as i define the word . 

almasy ' s return to the cave of the swimmers to retrieve the body of his beloved comes across as contrived rather than moving . katharine must have expired only moments earlier as she shows excellent colour and barely appears dozing , not at all corpse like . of course this is all for dramatic effect , as the romantics watching this tale ( normally i ' d be one of them ) would not appreciate a decaying , putrid corpse . in order to retrieve his adulterous lover ' s body , he has betrayed his comrades & the allies by giving his maps to the nazis , the english being cast as the villains of the piece . regardless of whether or not he ' s keeping his final promise to katharine , his traitorous act is not something i admire much . 

kip seems a pleasant fellow and hana generally likable , but their romance is not in the least engaging , merely a brief wartime fling with the parties indicating little trauma upon parting . moving back and forth between the two settings ( past sahara desert and present italy ) proved distracting and unpleasant but really , both stories were dull as dishwater . the only spark of interest in the whole picture was kip ' s tense mine disarming scene . 

not being totally heartless , i did have some sympathy for the current almasy ' s severely burned and dying state . however , perhaps my major complaint with this film is the euthanasia at the end when hana obliges her patient by giving him a morphine overdose . we are supposed to feel that this is justified and morally acceptable because she obviously has affection for almasy , cries while she is preparing the deadly syringe , and reads aloud from his allegedly passionate herodotus book to console him as he ' s dying . 

the amazing director david lean ' s masterpieces should not be insulted by comparison with this pathetic , immoral tale . yes , lawrence of arabia also has a desert , but in lean films ( doctor zhivago , brief encounter ) , those engaging in affairs are sympathetic characters exhibiting admirable restraint , guilt , and some regard for the betrayed spouse , as opposed to the total self absorption of this pair . in ryan ' s daughter , the cuckold husband displays touching loyalty and forgiveness . 

this movie is a supposedly intellectual , enormously over rated bit of boring and disgusting drivel that unfortunately passes itself off as a great love story . its best picture oscar does not speak well for the academy . for those who wonder why people are so hard on this movie , the answer is simple . it ' s awful .  if you are a catalan nationalist anarcho-socialist with unnuanced reverence for the mythologies of the spanish republic , this movie may be for you . two brothers , real-life ones ( one of them being marc recha himself ) , re-enact a fictional version of a real-life journey they had made through the spectacular catalan countryside , and history is evoked ( pans of bullet-holed walls , artillery booms on the soundtrack ) but not shown . there is very little dialog , and most of it is incidental : the story is told in a third-person voice-over , the voice being that of an actress impersonating the real-life sister of the real-life brothers . the images have little to do with what story line there is , which isn ' t much . many are stunning , brooding pans across stark semi-arid mountains and rivers ( think terrence malick or gus van sant -- there ' s not a little of both " gerry " and " last days " here ) , interspersed with some stunning still images and motionless frames . these are best enjoyed within the film ' s superb natural sound environment and without the ultimately tedious narration or even the occasional background music ( some quite good , some rather odd , but all gratuitous ) . the best of what this movie has to say is said in these sequences , with their occasional comment-less inclusion of power stations and dams . 

the relationship between the brothers is left sketchy and generic ; a major character is a man-biting catfish , never shown . the more the catalano-nationalist anarcho-whateverist commitments of the director are suggested , the more the film ' s richer , unspoken message is subverted and the more irritatingly narcissistic the experience becomes . though the director said at the nyff screening that the film was conceived from the beginning with its third-person narrative , i ' d like to see a version of it without the narrative or the music and with only the natural soundtrack and minimalist dialog -- the result might be more moving , and would in any case not be that much less baffling . 

meantime , this is most likely the only film you will see this year in which a guy strides into the frame with a cloth object ( the bathing suit he had been wearing ? ) dangling from his penis . this is one of the few moments in the whole movie in which your interest is ( sorry ) pricked by something that ' s actually happening on screen ( what is that ? why ' s it hanging there ? ) , but , as usual , no answers are provided . very warholian , very sixties , and a not a little tiresome .   " cover girl " is a lacklustre wwii musical with absolutely nothing memorable about it , save for its signature song , " long ago and far away . " this film came out before gene kelly really hit his artistic stride , and while there are evidences of his burgeoning talent here , mostly he plays sidekick to rita hayworth . and there ' s the problem . rita hayworth is gorgeous , no doubt about that . but she ' s simply not a compelling screen presence . i ' ve always found myself wanting to like her more than i actually do , and this movie is no exception . she ' s simply not a very good actress , and she ' s not even a very good dancer . good looking as she is , there ' s something vapid about her , and this movie suffers because of it . 

grade : c- a brilliant professor and his sidekick journey to the center of the earth in a huge machine which screws its way to the core . there , naturally , they find all kinds of things that are intent on killing and eating them . plus , of course , a love interest for the young sidekick . ho hum , does the plot never take a different tack ?  1960 ' s kid show with ex-vaudevillians playing handy men for hire . as you can expect they are a disaster at everything they do . over the course of the 11 minute episodes ( leaving 4 minutes for commercials in the 15 minute time slot ) , they do things like set up a fence between warring neighbors , help a magician on stage and deal with a found trunk and wallet . 

growing up i had never run across this show ( which appears to have been shot in new york ) . i thought i had run heard of or seen a most of the children ' s shows from the period either through having watched them as a kid or viewed them at nostalgia conventions . until alpha video released it on dvd i had been completely unaware if its existence . 

the show plays like the three stooges mixed with abbott and costello as done by people aping the routines . ( indeed one of the pair claims to have created the legendary " slowly i turned . . . " routine that abbott and costello perfected ) . its not bad , but its really not good either since everything seems watered down . the timing is often off ( though that maybe due to bad direction ) and the jokes were recycled years before the show first ran . odds are you ' ve seen it all before . on the plus side its the type of thing that would be perfect to introduce very young kids to the magic of vaudeville style comedy , however its going to be trying for parents to sit through even with the short episodes . 

for nostalgia junkies only . everyone else should look to seeing an abbott and costello or three stooges original .  the book gets 10 out of 10 stars . . . 

probably contains spoilers of both the book and the movie ! ! ! 

if you ' ve never read geoffrey household ' s rogue male , the source material for man hunt , you ' ll likely enjoy fritz lang ' s treatment of the story . on the other hand , if you ' re in my camp and have practically memorized the book , the movie will be a crashing disappointment . i ' ll assume you ' ve already read a synopsis of the story , and proceed to my complaints . household ' s little novel is one of the all-time great suspense classics , taut and spare , with only a bare handful of characters to propel the action . fritz lang and his screen writer dudley nichols feel the need to throw in the protagonist ' s brother and a sympathetic floozy , the latter of which reduces the depth of the story by injecting an extrinsic motivation into the screenplay where the novel needed none . in fact , the true climax of the book was not the nameless narrator ' s escape from his underground lair , but rather his self-acceptance of his true motive for going on his hunt in the first place . and that ' s another thing : if david fincher and quentin tarantino can get us all the way through fight club and kill bill 1 without revealing the names of their respective protagonists , why can ' t lang ? " thorndyke ? " what hat did they pull that out of ? which brings me to my bitterest complaint : household ' s hunter is so quintessentially british , he would bleed a union jack if you cut him . but walter pigeon , who plays him , is canadian ! he can barely sustain the accent , which is only slightly deeper and more convincing that kevin costner ' s in robin hood . he looked about right in the role , and was a fine actor for the 1940s , but as rogue male ' s reluctant hero ? let ' s look to the sceptered isle itself for a more convincing version . remake soon with subtlety and with , please ! i ' ll direct it for freeÂ  * * * * spitfire ( 1934 ) john cromwell ~ katharine hepburn , ralph bellamy , robert young 

mountain hillbilly katharine hepburn ( as trigger hicks ) is a religious back-woods laundry woman . " going on 18 " , she begins to attract male attention , and responds by throwing rocks . the arrival of a dam-building construction crew triggers dreams of romance in ms . hepburn . she quickly attracts the attention of suave engineer robert young ( as john stafford ) , who flirtingly hides his marital status . supervising engineer ralph bellamy ( as george fleetwood ) is also interested in hepburn , but for different reasons ; mr . bellamy wants to know more about jesus christ , whom hepburn worships . 

after hepburn employs the power of prayer to heal a child , neighborhood folks suspect she is a witch . 

if it weren ' t so serious , " spitfire " might be more amusing ; it is an atypical and wildly inappropriate vehicle for its star , who is thoroughly unconvincing . of the leads , mr . bellamy performs best . however , the best characterization is essayed by sarah haden ( as etta dawson ) , who appeared in george cukor ' s stage version , along with louis mason ( as bill grayson ) . will geer ( as west fry ) , " grandpa walton " in the 1970s , has a small role . an unexpected ending helps .  28 years before 9 / 11 , there was another 9 / 11 which represented a key date in the history of chile , south america and the whole world . this was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in chile deposed salvador allende the first marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism . allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace . 

unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of allende ' s rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history . the times were troubled and allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and of the whole world . true , he was democratically elected , but his policies plunged chile into economic crisis . he was deposed by a coup and a right-wing dictatorship followed with repression and flagrant human rights abuses , but he was also an ally of castro who saw in his policies another way of making revolution . we ' ll never know if his tentative to build a socialist yet democratic society would have succeeded . the authors of the movie take a completely pro-allende position , there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side , to answer questions like why did the middle class oppose him , or how his democratic views could go together with supporting or being supported by castro . the tone of the commentaries is nostalgic and apologetic , almost propagandistic . people who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the history need to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future .  the story : alain , a french policeman , is shocked to discover that he had a twin brother when his body is found in nice . investigating the murder , he finds out that he was in possession of a list that details the deeds of the russian mafia . helped by his brother ' s girlfriend , alain dodges russian gangsters & corrupt fbi agents while trying to find the list . 

 " maximum risk " is another one of the long list of action films that feature jean-claude van damme . as far as things go , it is strictly formulaic . the script sticks to the clichÃ©s & the acting is mediocre . there are some nicely done action sequences , with an inventive car chase , a fight in a burning building , an escape through rooftops , a brutal fight in an elevator & jcvd fleeing his enemies over an elevated train line . director ringo lam keeps everything going at a reasonable pace .  i was looking forward to this , and to be honest there were some bright spots , but it would have worked better if it had concentrated on one story rather than shooting all over the world . the many dogs were a lot of fun but i got bored of the wine fascists pompously whining ( ; - ) ) on about their achievements . 

i felt it would have worked better as an hour long tv documentary , concentrating on one of the many different issues it explored . the most interesting being the french town near montpelier fighting off a an american wine company ' s campaign to get rid of the historic forests . a socialist mayor agreed to a deal , a nicely timed election arrived , and a communist mayor was elected , who turned it down , much to the exasperation of the american wine execs . . . 

hopefully the director ' s cut will be shorter than the original . .  by randolph scott standards of the 1950s , this is a disappointing and heavy-handed star western . two or three of the characters could be dispensed with , while two or three other characters could be given more prominence . ( the humour needs to be completely rewritten . ) de toth handles the action well - as always - but his grasp of the overall narrative is weak .  not the best of the lone star series , but it moves along quickly with good performances . 

introduced as " singin ' sandy " in the main title , john wayne as a ' singing cowboy ' isn ' t successful-- you never even see a front close-up of him while he ' s ' singing . ' the actual singer is the director ' s son , bill bradley , who warbles away sounding like many popular singers of the day such as hutch or joseph wagstaff . 

the film features : cecilia parker ( also seen in " the lost jungle " serial , " tombstone canyon , " and as older sister marian in the andy hardy movies ) doing her best katherine hepburn-- " really they mustn ' t ; really i ' m not " ; al st . john , before he literally became " fuzzy " filling all his available screen time with his characteristic business of hat flipping , head and chin scratching , grimacing , and gawky physical gestures and movements ; george ( pre-gabby ) hayes as a gentle pipe smoking father ; and forrest taylor , minor vet of 395 movies and tv shows , playing the oily villain with string bow tie and prop cigar . 

fun or odd moments : yakima canutt ' s great ' under the stagecoach ' trick ; the ' gay ' scene when singin ' sandy ties bert and elmer together face to face , drags them roped to his horse , and dumps them at kincaid ' s office , where kincaid says , " you ' re a fine pair of lovebirds ! " ; denton ' s rapturous comment after an atrocious song and guitar playing performance by ' sandy , ' -- " ummm . i could listen to that all night ! " ; kincaid ' s reply , we won ' t go into that , " after being told by a rancher " you ' ve got the soul of a snake ! " ; and , of course , he utters the immortal , " i ' ve made denton an offer he can ' t refuse . " 

the plot of the movie is saved by sandy ' s tricking kincaid , and later saying the three magic words in many of these films : " i ' m from washington . " fdr has saved us from the depression ! ( is that why the villains are always either bankers or in real estate ? ) 

the shootout sequence is taken from the earlier bradbury film " man from hell ' s edges " ( 1932 ) . all of the lone star westerns are special because of their unique mixture of interesting characters , the troupe of actors and stunt people , and the spin on the clichÃ©s and repetitive back stories and situations . this one ranks a little low , marred by the inappropriate and mis-used " singing cowboy " gimmick . i ' ll give it a 4 .  after missing out on this innumerable times on tcm uk , i decided to check it out given its sci-fi / adventure / camp pedigree : i knew iâd be in for a thoroughly silly ride â but it was also astoundingly bad ! anyway , perhaps appropriately given the characters involved , the script rips off many sci-fi titles then of recent vintage â soylent green ( 1973 ) , zardoz ( 1974 ) , loganâs run ( 1976 ; to the extent that it was filmed on some of the self-same sets ! ) , star wars ( 1977 ) , alien ( 1979 ) and mad max 2 : the road warrior ( 1981 ) ! 

the plot is simple but not exactly engaging : from the title one can deduce that water has become scarce on the planet where all of this takes place â so our ragtag buccaneer heroes take it upon themselves to steal ice blocks from the tyrannical templar ( ! ) rulers . also involved is a beautiful princess ( mary crosby , daughter of bing ! ) in search of her father , the deposed king ; by the way , the cast includes another famous offspring : anjelica huston ( daughter of john ) as one of the pirate band â thankfully , the actressâ mistake in accepting such a role would soon be forgotten in the wake of her winning an oscar ( under her fatherâs guidance , no less ) for prizziâs honor ( 1985 ) . since star wars had peter cushing as the âsupreme commanderâ , the film-makers opted to have a screen legend of their own â 78-year old john carradine ( whoâs seen strapped to a sort of operating table during his one brief scene ! ) . 

the most notable bits ( for all the wrong reasons ) are : the alien using the toilet ; the castration machine ; the clumsy antics ( including karate-style combat ! ) of the inevitable robot companions ; the goofy slave / eunuch make-up worn at one point by the heroes ; the recurring attacks by the âspace herpiesâ ( whatever that is ) ; the climax in which the characters are made to age when going through a time-warp ( crosby becomes pregnant , gives birth , and sees her son grow up in the space of 30 seconds , while leading man robert urich himself is replaced by john ford stalwart hank worden for this scene ! ) â incidentally , the jump-cuts adopted here ( intending to denote the rapid passage of time ) are not only unsuccessful but downright irritating .  billed as a romantic comedy set against the early years of wwii it fails to deliver . the problem is that while beautifully photographed it has no consistent story line or narrative . starting as a murder mystery it offers no hope to its actors as it meanders through recent history . depardieu is wasted in a trivial role he obviously is not comfortable with playing . adjani cannot carry the picture . the hero is not ; obviously an imitation of a hitchcock " wrongly accused " role it lacks balance . neither heroic , comic nor suspenseful . 

this could have been a good film . i am reminded of " the lady vanishes " which did combine suspense , romance and comedy in a serious film dealing with fascism .  although allegedly autobiographical , this movie demonstrates very little insight both into the protagonist ' s psychology ( resulting in a flat , fragmented characterization ) as well as into larger-scale historical processes , and my hope of either learning something new or improving my understanding of contemporary iran remained unfulfilled . instead , i found my sensibilities somewhat dulled as a succession of bearded islamic villains replaced each other taunting , torturing or killing the wantonly victimized prototypical middle-class iranian whose western cultural sympathies were patent ( and whose exoneration the movie quite blatantly seeks . ) the deeper understanding the movie does seem to demonstrate is that of the mass-media market , as it serves to nourish prevalent occidental folk-ideologies ( i . e . a " crowd pleaser " ) . 

what redeemed the movie from being outright boring was its creative animation - genuinely minimalistic imagery which , nevertheless , always kept the screen rich , expressive and unambiguous - no small fete for which i do give it some stars .  this movie includes 2 well known actors i have previously enjoyed watching . there actions are great and each action is heart felt . but it makes me think these 2 were thrown into a speech / drama class at college for the first time and told for one to act dominating and constricting to the other in a room without allowing her to leave and the woman to be truly innocent and treat her with enough mind-humping to drive the audience into tears for her release . 

the only good part is the acting abilities , the plot has the same ruse as hitlers influence and i started to hate the protagonist for that . but all of this could have been done within 15 minutes in my opinion , so to drag it out for over an hour was just pure punishment for all who watched it . 

 i ' m not really much of an abbott & costello fan ( although i do enjoy " who ' s on first " ) and , to be honest , there wasn ' t much in this movie that would inspire me to watch any more of their work . it wasn ' t really bad . it had some mildly amusing scenes , and actually a very convincing giant played by buddy baer , but somehow , given the fame of the duo and the esteem in which they ' re generally held , i have to say i was expecting more . as the story goes , the pair stumble into a babysitting job , and during the reading of jack & the beanstalk as a bedtime story ( with the kid reading it to costello ) , costello ' s jack falls asleep and dreams himself into the story . there ' s a " wizard of oz " kind of feel to the story , in that the characters in the dream are all the equivalents of real-life acquaintances of jack , and the movie opens in black & white and shifts to colour during the dream sequence . the fight scenes between jack and the giant and the dance scene between jack and polly ( dorothy ford ) are among the amusing parts of the movie . polly , of course , also leads to one of the questions of the movie - what happened to her ? jack and gang apparently left her behind in the giant ' s castle ! i know - it was just a dream , so who cares . still - i wondered . there were also a couple of cute song and dance routines . my 4 year old giggled a bit during this , so she was able to appreciate some of the humour . i found it to be an acceptable timewaster , but certainly not anything that would convince you of abbott and costello as comic geniuses . 4 / 10  " nicodemus " is almost a copy of " red " in the odd behavior sense , but this episode focuses on other people in clark kent ' s unpredictable life . when a poisonous flower finds it ' s way into smallville jonathan kent is the first to be effected by it . the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it effects jonathan , he becomes short tempered and violent , however clark manages to stop him from doing anything rash until his father finally passes out . okay . so far , so good . next up is lana . the episode was good up to that point , for the flower causes her to attempt seducing clark . at the last moment , he refuses her but the damage has already been done . this episode causes the wrong impressions and isn ' t suitable for people under the age of twenty , due to it ' s adult content . the first part was good , the last part ( focusing on the effect the flower has on pete ) was good , but the middle that was all about lana ' s alternate personality , was most defiantly not , and that ruined what could have been a brilliant episode . i give this episode two .  swoon focuses on leopold and loeb ' s homosexual relationship - a facet of the case that has been mostly ( and unjustly ) ignored since their trial , even by leopold himself in his autobiography . but , even in its treatment of this swoon over does it by far . worse , it twists , combines , and straight out alters the details of the case which will irritate anyone who knows much about it while at the same time managing to confuse those who are not familiar with it . while it is an interestingly made film , swoon stinks . 

1 out of 10 - awful .  i was very disappointed by this movie . ms english who says that she is a fan of the original movie seemed to have taken a great piece of artistic work , and transformed it into a flat-lined " ho-hum " you ' ve come a long way baby production . i tried to like meg ryan ' s mary haines , but she was just boring . she didn ' t seem to feel anything about her husband ' s affair . there was no emotional struggle , no deep hurt . in the original 1939 movie norma shearer ' s mary haines felt betrayed , shocked , vulnerable , confused and angry . the 2008 production was more about some fake sisterhood theme , ( actually my wife ' s words ) and didn ' t make you shed a tear or even chuckle . the only performances that were note worthy we ' re of debra messing , and bette midler . ( i wanted more of bette . ) there was really no protagonist in this movie . the sylvia fowler character had too many sub themes to it . and crystal allen had no fire . the remake of the department store encounter with annette benning , and miss mendez was luke warm . also the pacing was slow as well . obviously the 1939 version needed to be updated , but this one wasn ' t it . the reason that the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with " man " problems . a subject by the way which isn ' t out-dated . the magic of the original movie was that the movie was about both sexes , while you never saw the men .  the 1935 version of " enchanted april " manages to be simultaneously tedious

and perfunctory . it is difficult to show the transformative magic of italy shooting in a studio with only stereotypical italian behavior to belabor . the transformation of the four strangers fleeing london is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later . rather than develop , the screenplay flips a switch and the

characters are different . 

the husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up , even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their shells and / or hostilities . 

jessie ralph has the most fun ( moving instead of entirely chewing up the

scenery ) and katharine alexander has some poignant charm out of her

husband ' s shadow ( and away from his hideous droning ) . ann harding is

unremarkable here ( with the production code being enforced ) . she had an

appropriate line in an earlier ( pre-code ) movie , " when ladies meet " : " you ' re

not worth a minute of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you , " but in " enchanted april " can only look hurt , rush out , and proclaim fealty to her errant husband .  what can have been on irene dunne ' s mind when she accepted the role in this distasteful account of a woman of negotiable morals ? certainly , the irene dunne of the 1940 ' s , whose reputation as a faithful roman catholic who publicly abhorred smut , and shunned any film scripts or hollywood society , that might be even be remotely construed as corrupting public morals--would never have become associated with such a dubious project as this . 

perhaps , new york ' s cardinal spellman , in his private audience with her , gave her a good dressing down over this role ? that we will likely never know , inasmuch as she never spoke of it in later years , though she did denounce her morally suspect , ( though quite successful ) 1932 film , " back street " as " trash " . 

certainly by the time she received the distinguished st . robert bellarmine award in 1965 for exemplary public catholicism , " ann vickers " was no longer recalled by the general public . 

suffice it to say that " ann vickers " works neither as entertainment or social commentary . 

miss dunne ' s role as an adulterous social worker , who sleeps around , ( between reforming prisons and writing a best seller on correctional rehabilitation ) doesn ' t dovetail with her temperament or on screen demeanor , and one keeps suspecting that the whole thing is a kind of tongue in cheek gag , ( what else can we think when we witness a montage of miss dunne ' s sympathetic beatific gaze superimposed over a shot of a female prisoner being scourged ? ) by films end , she has renounced careerism in favor of marriage , ( to crusty convict walter huston no less--and what kind of lunacy would ever conceive of pairing these two romantically ? ) 

irene dunne completists will no doubt wish to see this curiosity , if only for the chance to hear her promise to rehabilitate a cocaine addict under her charge : " i ' m going to get you off the snow cold turkey " ! ! ! 

well , if nothing else such sordid goings on , do present her light years from her usual milieu of operatic trills , furbellowed chiffon and strawberry phosphates--cocaine addiction not being the first subject one associates with the irreproachable miss dunne .  this cartoon is not right , lol i totally disagree with a lot of things it portrayed however it ended on a positive note , but as for me and mine we will not be viewing this in our household mainly because we fight against stereotypes every day and this cartoon just confirms what most white people feel black people act like

the comment one of the little black girls made on the cartoon was that her boyfriend was so conscious ( he was white ) that really offended me that ' s not something we as black people take lightly conscious is a state of being that black people achieve when they realize their true ability freddy forsyth has come up with a storyline which will suit the mood of the west ' s suspicions about putin ' s russia . forsyth installs a nasty guy as the ruski president who wants to return the country - not so much to stalin ' s communism but more to hitlerian fascism . in fact , his political manifesto could have come straight out of mein kampf rather than marx . and , the loon has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the ethnic cleansing pogrom of the russian federation . american mercenaries connive with the russian prez to realise his fanatical , genocidal dream , but then enter dirty dancing ' s pat swayze . . . and , yep , things get really down and dirty . he ' s a former us operative-turned-drifter , jason monk , who is enlisted by the british government to see what the russians are up to . as a corny sidebar , swayze ' s character who is no monk ( ! ) has sired a russian beauty elena ( played by the gorgeous marta kondova ) on his previous missions to the former commie state . hardman swayze does a passable job in setting out to defeat the evil russians . but young unknown actress marta kondova steals the flick as his nubile , 18-year-old russian daughter elena who helps dad root out the terror threatening her beloved mother russia .  i pretty much liked every character on this show from the start except reba herself . she comes off as an holier than thou type and quite frankly a big bully . and that stinks because she is in every scene and every episode . in the later seasons van becomes unlikeable too , like a spoof of his former self . and kyra walks around sneering and being miserable . the first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you overlook reba . towards the end its pretty bleak . . in basically every episode barbara jean is walking around being dumb , reba is being mean to her , but poor ole barbara jean desperately wants reba to like her which results in barabara jean telling reba how awesome she is in every episode . i think it is pretty clear to see reba has self esteem issues and wants to be seen as this all forgiving saint . its really a shame too because other than her the show had such potential .  distasteful british film from a japanese novel about a very troubled young man who comes under the influence of a hitler-like classmate and plots to harm his widowed mother ' s lover . a couple of good scenes ( sarah miles discovering her son has been peeping at her and confronts him in anger , the pasty-faced lad trying to ensnare kris kristofferson to his demise by being extra friendly ) , but what ' s the point beyond provoking shock ? ugly and uneasy , it doesn ' t showcase anyone involved to any advantage ( especially kristofferson , whose hollow stares and usual gravelly talk is out-of-place in a psychological mishmash like this one ) . coldly without any sense of its own absurdity , director lewis john carlino seems to believe a circumstance like this could actually happen . if he ' s right , that ' s far more shocking than anything in " sailor " . * from * * * *  the fifth collaboration between marlene dietrich and director josef von sternberg , blonde venus is a film that looks great while it ' s playing but fails to engages the viewer . the plodding storyline of dietrich being torn between two men , becoming a mammoth cabaret star , and fighting for the custody of her child is jumbled and often feels like bits of three separate films half-baked together . dietrich is unwisely cast in a rather passive , reactive role for much of the film and her character remains aloof from viewers , while herbert marshal is unconvincing as her ill-tempered husband , and cary grant is largely wasted as a suave suitor who dashes in and out of the picture . the film does contain some intriguing set pieces ( the " hot voodoo " number is the high point ) that are impressively surrealistic for this era in hollywood , although it proves to no avail in such a dull , incoherent film .  creakiness and atmosphere this film has , but so unfortunately does the print i just viewed . raymond massey provides a laid back sherlock holmes , almost comically so in early scenes in his bathrobe , which he trades in for a laborer ' s garb to investigate the creepy mansion of dr . rylott ( lyn harding ) . what wasn ' t clear to me was why rylott would have wanted his stepdaughters dead . if as in the case of helen ( angela baddeley ) , he didn ' t want her to run off to get married , he would have accomplished the same thing by having her dispatched . 

other curiosities abound as well . after setting an early wedding date with helen , the fiancÃ©e is no longer heard from for the rest of the picture . the presence of a band of gypsies at the time of violet stoner ' s death provides merely a diversion , and what could have been an interesting murder tool , a poisonous snake , is diluted by the fact that it was not a cobra , the musical renderings of the indian man servant notwithstanding . 

athole stewart competently portrays holmes ' aide dr . watson , though he takes some getting used to if nigel bruce is more your cup of tea . as rylott , lyn harding is sufficiently menacing , a trait that would be put to good use as holmes ' nemesis professor moriarty in two later films - 1935 ' s " the triumph of sherlock holmes " and 1937 ' s " murder at the baskervilles " . 

with repeated choppiness and an unsteady camera , it ' s surprising that the story line isn ' t more disrupted than it is . it ' s integrity is generally maintained , even if one stretches a bit to fill in the gaps . i guess that would be my main complaint with the film , as mentally bridging some of the jump cuts in the picture proved to be a real pain in the asp .  if good intentions made a film great , then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made . the film has great actors , a master director , a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme , undertone of fifties existential world-weariness , aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination , and characters about which one might deeply care . it is about patriotism and about patriotism in a healthy way . 

not quite ten years after the film , i knew air force officers who taught my r . o . t . c . classes at university . they were intellectuals . they thought deeply about their work . they has senses of humor . one had been a crew member on the first plane to drop a hydrogen bomb . i have wondered if any one of them died in vietnam . i imagine that they flew missions there . 

regrettably , the film fails . the movie lacks visual interest , drama , expression of feeling , and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative . no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie . her susan holland is a woman that one would flee , not embrace . col . james stewart ( who as then a colonel ) makes a good stab at this role as lt . col ( and later col . ) dutch holland . but the most interesting thing he does in the role is bite into a sandwich . i ' m not kidding . stewart was good as biting in sandwiches as he did in the spirit of saint louis . 

one might think of ted williams , but i don ' t when i watch mr . steward in the role . i do think of william holden as lt . harry brubaker in the bridges at toko-ri . the comparison is not good for mr . stewart , who seems wasted in this film . 

footage shot from a b-36 looks like outtakes from commercials for an airline . though beautiful , the aerial shots are mundane . for the time , they might have impressed viewers . the crash in greenland involves unexciting modeling you expect the outcome to be good . 

the undertone--the subtext-- for the film voices the tedium that air force flight crews must have felt during their long missions and the banality that the air force used to make its business--well business like any other business . one imagines how a la nouvelle vague director might explore this theme and then one begins to think about how someone with imagination might have filmed this movie . little moments are missed . when crews returned from long missions , the members of the crew got a shot of scotch and a massage before debriefing the mission . showing that might have helped . 

banality was the image the air force wanted and mr . mann accommodated the brass . maybe , in that sense , the film works , but not for me . 

i mourn when i watch the movie , because i think all of us , director , actors , crew , viewers , and members of the armed services might have enjoyed giving and getting much more than we get here . 

i don ' t think that this movie had to be dr . strangelove or 2001 , both of which it presages , but it had potential never realized . yet , i enjoy watching it . i think of the airmen on their long missions and the ground crews in isolated places . there is a certain sense of honor celebrated here and i celebrate that honor . 

i certainly understand why people who praise this movie here and other places appreciate it . if there were no intentional fallacy , it would get a 10 from me . 

 .  ivan the terrible is more a filmed stage play than a " big-screen-opus " . citizen kane - a similar work in many ways - is quite the opposite ( in the way we come to expect such fare ) in that it has lots of location shooting for example . 

acting is meant to convey a character ' s motivations and thinking to the audience ; if it succeeds in making you understand the character , what does it matter how it was done ? and considering the low amount of action , how else is one to express events that influence the story , and consequently the characters ' machinations and decisions other than " exaggerated movements " ? 

as well , there ' s a historical level why the acting style should not surprise . the rise of totalitarian regimes in germany and ussr forced film-makers who stayed behind to make films the way they knew how . as they were prevented access to more modern works that showed cinema ' s evolution and techniques , they only used what they knew . 

the nazi ' s control of government in germany destroyed the great german film industry of the 1920 ' s , due to their total control over that film industry . and propaganda films can only " entertain " german troops so much ; hence the need for popular german silent films of the 1920 ' s , for example . so a lot of ivan the terrible film ' s techniques would have been derived from such captured german films supplied to the film crew ( as mentioned in other comments ) . 

there was no confusion anywhere and though personally it was found over-hyped , it is by no means a bad cinematic experience - and definitely not amongst the worse films ever . the acting is fine , and part of the cinematography excellent ( even by today ' s standards ; more below ) . definitely not a popcorn flick ; one can ' t leave their brain outside this one ' s door . dated perhaps and very symbolic - only worth watching on the big screen if one is unable to view the films with the lights off at home , for many of the cinematic elements will be lost in these films ' chiefly b & w experience . it all depends upon what expectations one walks in with . . . 

warning - spoilers : do not read the following comments , in case they influence your personal view of the film ( s ) . 

 . . . and if one does not mind the obvious communist propaganda ( as opposed to capitalist propaganda ) . for ivan is how stalin saw himself - obvious in his influence on the film ' s direction ( see other comments ) - and anyone with a world historical awareness outside the us perspective will definitely understand this . maybe ivan was an earlier incarnation of stalin , or maybe not ; this is more a diatribe on stalin and his motivations , decisions , loneliness , promotions of lackeys , etc - using the persona of ivan - than any true historical record of ivan . also note the obvious use of particular colours in the sequel : red ( for the ussr ) in the banquet scene . and perhaps blue ( for the usa ) during certain shots when the usurper wears the crown ? 

but it has many excellent visuals such as the profound use of shadows , or the exterior shot of the populace coming to beg ivan ' s return to moscow .  you ' d hardly know that a year later mgm put norma shearer in the divorcee which glows with mgm technical know how . how far they came in one year . cheney is a very stagey early talkie . the camera hardly moves . shearer is her usual charming self and rathbone does well in a romantic leading role . they are all very careful to speak clearly and slowly into the microphone source which does mitigate against a naturally flowing dramatic scene , but the play is a sturdy and fun warhorse so one can enjoy oneself if one ' s expectations are not too high . oh , by the way , the plot involves a ring of upper class jewel thieves who infiltrate themselves into society to prey on their victims . there are some clever twists in the script and true love conquers all . an oscar nom for best screenplay adaptation .  1st watched 10 / 29 / 2006 - 4 out of 10 ( dir-john stephenson ) : mildly entertaining story of a group of five kids who are forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight & work in world war i as england entered the war . they are told not to go in the greenhouse of the uncle ' s mansion , which of course they do over and over , and they discover a sand fairy who them daily wishes that only last until the sun goes down . this is the " it " referred to in the title , created by the jim henson group and voiced by eddie izzard . the problem is their wishes usually bring about other problems that they are supposed to learn from . this part of the movie is not done very well because it ' s obvious the children , primarily the freddie highmore character , do not learn from them but instead keep going back to " it " to solve their next big problem . " it " is not nearly as funny as it could have been with the comedian eddie izzard really not given much opportunity to improvise and kenneth branagh is wasted as the eccentric uncle , although he is the best character . the children are fine as far as their acting abilities but the story probably would have been much better going into the fantasy realm but they did have a human story to tell as well , which probably caused the confusion with the filmmakers . so , all in all , this was an ok film but could have been much better .  so i rented this movie hoping to learn about the democratic republic of congo ( drc ) and the beginnings of its independence from belgian rule . i was excited to become familiar with the figures involved in its history , mainly lumumba and mobutu . i wanted to see how the new congolese government attempted to bring together the various groups opposing colonial rule , the political motives behind each one , the reasons behind belgium ' s decision to give the drc its independence , and also how the united states and the former ussr were involved . sadly , all of my questions went largely unanswered . my belief is that this movie was made by people who , through a passing familiarity with the story of the drc ' s fight for freedom , saw a story filled with drama and emotion , and decided to exploit it . they then proceeded to try and stuff all the dramatic points into a storyline , briefly filled them out with dialogue , went to the set and shot it . i could be wrong , but if so it ' s all the sadder , because then the makers must have simply become too tied up in getting everything in , and ended up glossing over all details in an effort to create an encompassing history . whatever the reason , the fact is that the movie could be a timeline of sentence-long statements and facts printed on the screen . the film goes through each major occurrence , and tells the viewer point-blank the main idea of what ' s going on , completely smoothing over the actual details in favor of getting across the big things . for instance , there is the scene when lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by mobutu . in the situation the soldiers have three possible viewpoints : one that sympathizes with lumumba , one that vilifies lumumba , and one that stands in the middle , sympathizing and yet obeying orders . correspondingly , there are three soldiers that speak in the scene , uttering lines that unadornedly show their points of view . then , to avoid dealing with the actual tensions that these opposing viewpoints bring up , the scriptwriters simply inserted some random shooting , more army guys show up and they just end up beating everyone up . this is the extent of the reflectiveness of the movie . most of the time , each character simply states their basic motives , the other characters respond with theirs , and that ' s that . there ' s little telling through actions ; even the things they say are direct the point of painfulness . it ' s hard to believe that the people represented actually acted like that . also , in the trend of this directness , things like political tension between factions is reduced to simple acknowledgement of the fact-- we never learn what these factions are , what they ' re fighting for , their power , basically anything except that they exist . the characters likewise are one-dimensional and flat ; unfortunately i don ' t know whether lumumba was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to ideals of congolese unity , but after an hour or so of the movie i certainly didn ' t trust it to tell me so . the drc , like many developing countries , has a complicated and important history , especially in the period leading up to and after independence . but the telling of these histories will not be useful unless there is recognition of the intricacy of the situations . lumumba fails to give proper attention to these details , and ends up telling the viewer little except the most general of outlines .  in need of work , straight man bud abbott ( as jack ) and comic partner lou costello ( as dinkel ) get the latter a job babysitting self-described " problem child " david stollery ( as donald ) . young stollery winds up reading mr . costello ' s favorite novel ( see if you can guess the title ) , which puts costello to sleep , dreaming he and mr . abbott are reliving the story of " jack and the beanstalk " ( you guessed it ) . 

the sepia-tone switches to color for the bulk of the production . apparently , this was an attempt at something different for the duo , a colorful children ' s fantasy . it fails , but this is where you get to see abbott & costello in color , silent film superstar william farnum ( as the king ) make his last performance a bit part , boxer max baer ' s brother buddy , and stollery before disney ' s " spin and marty " . 

 * * jack and the beanstalk ( 4 / 4 / 52 ) jean yarbrough ~ lou costello , bud abbott , buddy baer , william farnum i first rented this movie on the infamous day of september 11 , 2001 . since then i ' ve seen it a number of times . my only complaint is that it ' s too short . " strangeland " would ' ve be a complete piece of horror art at two hours . as it stands , the running time is only an hour and a half . 

ex-twisted sister member dee snider wrote , produced and stars in this 1998 shockfest set in a small colorado town . he plays carleton hendricks , a crazed sadist who has psychotic ideologies on human evolution and a love for near-death experiences . hendricks is no pushover , he ' s a pumped up six-foot " modern primitive " . someone who has tattooed and pierced their body to the very extreme . when he makes his first full appearance in the film , it is a truly terrifying sight . 

hendricks ' main hobby in life is to share his " spiritual awakenings " with his kidnapped victims . he visits internet chatrooms under the name " capt . howdy " and then invites people over to his house . they believe they ' re going to a party . instead , they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering . hendricks sows their eyes and mouths shut and tortures them by sticking blades and hooks in numerous parts of their body . if it sounds sick , it ' s because it is . 

one of hendrick ' s victims is genevieve , the teenaged daughter of detective michael gage . gage not only manages to save her , but arrests hendricks as well . four years later , hendricks is released from a mental institution completely rehabilitated to the disapproval of the community . a group of rednecks led by freddy krueger himself , actor robert englund , decide to kill him . they fail and hendricks reverts back to his old self . 

the rest of the film i ' ll leave to you , only to say the conclusion is satisfying and will leave you in shivers . with the exception of snider , the acting isn ' t too good , but it ' s serviceable . the direction is okay , too . there are some humorous parts in " strangeland " and they are very funny . i also loved the soundtrack , it ' s awesome and worth buying if you love rock . overall , this is a movie worth watching . if you love low-budget horror films with a sense of humor , check it out . you ' ll probably like it .  the one line summary is actually the punch line of a very old joke that begins " what is a jewish porno film ? " 

while this film had its interesting moments , it was far too slow moving and did not do enough to explain to those of us in the audience unfamiliar with orthodox jewish custom , exactly what was going on and why ? how many people who came across this film would know that the bathtub the female characters were washing in is in reality called a " mikveh " which is a ritual bath used to cleanse spiritual uncleanliness ? the same question might be asked of why the bride was walked around the groom a dizzying number of times while her face was covered just prior to the marriage vows being performed . these two examples are but two of a large number of such moments that remained completely unexplained to the uninitiated audience . 

this film does have its touching moments along with expressions of great love and emotions . the characters are presented very authentically right down to the number of garments an ultra orthodox jewish male must wear as well as the religious rituals he must engage in upon awakening in the morning to begin his day . the attitudes orthodox judaism has towards women in general and wives in particular is both intriguing and at times maddening . this is another reason why more explanation is needed if this story is to be understood in context . 

i recommend this film to people who are familiar with orthodox jewish tradition and ritual as well as those who might be interested in getting a brief peek at what the lives of people who practice this way of life is like . 

the story itself about two sisters who in their own ways rebel against " the system " is of moderate interest at best .  stylized hollywood westerns , full of familiar conventions , seem to have eternal life and this is an avatar . everything in it seems to have been scraped out of the back of a drawer from 1939 , a larger budget applied , and this production its issue . 

gary cooper has played this sort of role dozens of times -- the displaced southerner , fast on the draw and firm with honor , though kinda easy going whenever possible . he plays blayde hollister who travels to texas looking for the gang who destroyed his cotton plantation . he wears a buckskin-fringed shirt and packs two ivory-handled six shooters . he speaks with a countrified accent -- " a feller could get hurt doin ' this . " ( cf . , " sergeant york . " ) the gang is led by sneering raymond massey , who buys and sells land , usually by underhanded means whenever possible . the gang includes steve cochran , who cannot play a westerner though he ' s very good at scum bags in general . the requisite woman is ruth roman , daughter of the mexican plantation owner , who looks and speaks about as mexican as a boston brown betty . 

i don ' t think i ' ll bother too much with the plot . no doubt someone has gone into it in some detail and it ' s not worth much more mention . as in any 1939 western , it ' s labyrinthine . everyone except cooper and his friends are underhanded and there are multiple double crosses and switched identities and hidden secrets . 

everything is retro . the plot , the dialog , the wardrobe , even the music . the score is by warner ' s stalwart max steiner . he ' s the guy that scored " king kong . " that was 1932 . this movie was released in 1950 . 

cooper ' s name , by the way -- " blayde hollister " -- prompted me to look through the records of the raca -- the real american cowboy associaton -- to see if that name cropped up in their archives , which date from the beginning of time to february 4th , 1911 , when the last real cowboy passed away due to an unfortunate encounter with a deranged peccary . there has never been a real cowboy with the name blayde . hollister , yes , but not blayde . as a matter of fact , there is no record of any real cowboy named wade , luke , cole , or matt either . the most popular names for genuine cowboys , in descending order of frequency , were clarence , mortimer , noble , nebukadnezzar , plautus , pinchbeck , and hortense . 

if this movie had been released in 1939 , it would have been routine . in 1950 , it is a calamitous monument in the history of human recycling .  the ( dvd ) movie " the tempest " , directed by jack bender , was published in 2001 . it didn ' t make its way to german cinemas and neither the director or an actor were able to receive an important award for this movie . the movie refers to the shakespearean play " the tempest " which was published at the end of the 16th century . the director tried to create an modern version of this play , but failed . at the beginning of the movie the plantation owner prosper gets in a conflict with his brother antonio about the treatment of their slaves . antonio sets his brother a trip and tries to kill him but with the help of a witch , prosper is able to escape and flees with his daughter and a slave called ariel to a small island nearby the mississippi river . for over twelve years he has lived isolated on this island , till a lucky chance enables him to take revenge on his brother . . . . if prosper will be lucky you have to find out by yourself . 

in my opinion this film is really a bad try to create a modern version of the original play by william shakespeare . the story of the movie is confusing as well as the characters . prosper doesn ' t have the same powers as in the tempest . . . . . end of part i very stark , very drab , no real drama . why not just make a documentary ? this isn ' t exactly the passion of joan of arc . the only reason for seeing chronicles is to hear the performances . i love bach ' s music and even i found it hard to sit through this misery of a film . the great gustav leonhardt plays ( in two senses of the word ) bach . we don ' t get much of a sense of him as an actor , since he ' s given so little to do dramatically . mostly , he gets to walk purposefully or angrily out of various rooms . bach ' s life , of course , was not an errol flynn movie . it was indeed fairly drab and more than a little hard . this probably means that the life isn ' t a terrific candidate for a film . the music , of course , is another story . i recommend the stations of bach . far more information , for one thing , and some insight into the music , which is , after all , why bach interests us in the first place .  derek jarman has shown us time and time again that dialog is not his strong suit . he is a painter , and paint he does . his films are almost always visually splendid , but about as exciting to watch as paint that is already dry . watch his movies in fast forward , the really fast setting that you can only get on dvd . in the tempest , jarman does very little with the script or the characters , using them as simply a lattice to hang a very long and well-constructed cinematographic frame . he even goes so far as to contradict shakespeare ' s original script to achieve these excrucriatingly slow and lifeless scenes . there is none of the romance , magic , trickery , or urgency the script calls for , little spontaneity , and the character of caliban in particular is reduced to a quivering and insane idiot of sorts , similar to gaveston in jarman ' s edward ii . it is too bad that this is just about the only film version of the tempest available .  i ' ve read all the dave robicheaux novels and consider james lee burke to be my favorite contemporary fiction writer . i ' ve also visited new iberia and much of acadiana to be able to better visualize the setting in most of these books . needless to say , i greatly anticipated seeing " in the electric mist , " especially since i thought tommy lee jones would be terrific as robicheaux . 

i was greatly disappointed . the story was very choppy ; the interplay with the " ghosts of confederate dead " was shallow and lost the impact and nobility it added to the book ; and tommy lee jones was doleful , expressionless and difficult to understand as dr . the best way to describe this forgettable film is to add my " ditto " to an earlier user comment that this movie was like one of those old made-for-tv movies . i expected jill st . john or cameron mitchell to show up at any time . 

the location settings were accurate , and the photography at times captured the essence of the steamy bayous , smoky juke joints and eerie above-ground graveyards of south louisiana . too bad the story ' s disjointed presentation and tommy lee ' s sub-par performance interfered with the unique mood and spicy zest of the region . 

next to final comment : in the novels , dave robicheaux ' s nickname is " streak , " because of the distinct streak of silver-gray hair on one side of his head . ( similar to how the sopranos ' paulie walnuts would appear if he were seen only in profile . ) tommy lee had no such streak in this film , probably because the editors are james lee burke fans and they airbrushed the streak out after witnessing mr . jones ' s poor imitation of dave robicheaux . 

final comment : while i generally find alec baldwin to be pompous and obnoxious in most roles , he was by far a better robicheaux in " heaven ' s prisoners " than tommy lee was in " in the electric mist . " also , heaven ' s prisoners is much more interesting and exciting , with uniformly believable performances and more evocative atmosphere than this new movie . 

 " in the electric mist " is okay to watch when one feels like " veging out " and there ' s nothing better on tv . but then , so are infomercials .  this is supposed to be charlie ' s masterpiece , but i will contend that it is actually one of his weaker films . first of all , it ' s not funny . not one thing in this movie made me laugh . okay , there ' s a quick jump into a box that was a giggle , but that was one of desperation . the tramp ' s first - and only - talkie where he speaks ( he sings in an earlier film ) , but his flat dialogue shows us exactly why he was such a joy to watch in " modern times " and " gold rush " - two films that are at least ten times better than this film . there ' s literally only one good scene in this film , the one where hitler plays with the globe like a beach ball . that ' s it . 

okay , so it gets a lot of praise for being the first film to wage war , even long before we entered the war . nope . not true . simply not true , so that praise can be turned down a bit . the three stooges did it on january 19 , 1940 with " you natzy spy " - ten months earlier than the october release of chaplin ' s film - and that movie was actually funny ! if you want to watch chaplin ' s greatest film , watch this only for reference . and then pop in " modern times " , " gold rush " , " city lights " , " limelight " , " the kid " , or even " tillie ' s punctured romance " .  this soap is worse than bad : it ' s poisonous . of the many television shows that have had a corrosive influence on british society over the past twenty years , eastenders is the prime example . for two decades this show has celebrated the oaf , the thug , the wide-boy , the tart , the gobby , the violent , the sexually-incontinent , the criminal , the ignorant , the unambitious . . . 

how many times has someone or other remarked that eastenders " mirrors life " ? life on which planet , exactly ? 

it ' s written about " working-class " characters , as imagined by middle-class people who have taken a course in creative writing . eager to show to their middle-class peers how familiar they are with the " working-class " they dream up the lumpen rabble that is the citizenry of eastenders . 

this has a toxic effect on some minds less well-equipped than others to handle fiction , and so we find members of the real population assuming the attitudes and demeanour of the inhabitants of walford . 

thus , it came to pass that eastenders mirrors life ; but only after life had been hoodwinked into mirroring eastenders . 

other soaps have followed in ee ' s footsteps , filled to their stinking gunwhales with ugly , potato-faced , shaven-headed , pot-bellied characters , scowling at each other and issuing threats constantly . this is the proletariat as perceived by the writers who produce this trash . the writers will grow rich on the proceeds of such output , and will go on to enjoy the finer things of life in their rarified enclaves . meanwhile , the burgeoning number of new , tv-induced drones will proceed inexorably toward cultural bankruptcy . 

and there you have the new priests and the new creatures of the early 21st century . much of this is due to the immeasurable power of that illuminated boxful of dancing pixels in the corner of your living-room . it ' s your fault , gentle reader : that ' s what you chose as the only window through which to look out from your prison .  iâd been interested in watching this ever since it was cited as the worst film ever on an entry devoted to 1950s sci-fi cinema in a british periodical from the early 1980s entitled âthe movieâ ( incidentally , the leonard maltin film guide also awarded this the unenviable bomb rating ) . when it came out on dvd last year , i became interested in purchasing the âcult camp classicsâ box set in which it was included ( along with queen of outer space [1958] and the giant behemoth [1959] ) ; however , since recently acquiring queen on dvd-r , i had put paid to the idea . 

happily , iâve just stumbled upon the film on divx â however , the print wasnât culled from the warners dvd ( which is said to boast a surprisingly pleasant-looking transfer ) but rather a muddy tv printâ¦though not so much that the detail is lost ( in other words , it was like watching the film in sepia as opposed to black-and-white ! ) . anyway , to get to the matter at hand : i have to admit that , in a way , i was disappointed the film didnât prove to be the laugh-fest i had anticipated all this time ( maltin calls it âhilariously awfulâ ) ; actually , i found it quite engaging â and thankfully brief at a little over an hour in length . some undeniably amusing bits remain though â such as when the old nurse starts screaming her head off at the sight of the 50-foot woman , and when the sheriffâs deputy almost runs over his chief and the leading ladyâs butler in his enthusiasm to be of assistance in such an unusual case . neither did the special effects hit me as being âamong the funniestâ ( maltin again ) on film â though theyâre certainly embarrassingly bad ! 

o . k . , so the idea that an alien ( in giant-sized human form , clad in cave-man rags , and radioactive to boot ! ) coming to earth in a big ball-shaped ( ! ) spaceship and apparently after the heroineâs prized necklace is utter nonsense â and his quasi-transparent appearance does it no favors at allâ¦but , really , itâs the human story that holds our attention ( relatively speaking ) . the character of the philandering husband isnât very interesting , but his two women are : wealthy but nagging alcoholic wife allison hayes and ambitious , vixenish girlfriend yvette vickers . also involved in the narrative are hayesâ faithful servant ( already mentioned ) , a couple of cops ( one of them , as noted elsewhere , being amiably goofy ) and as many doctors ( one of whom is named dr . cushing[ ! ] and another a specialist whoâs called in when hayes starts growing in size after being exposed to radiation ) . 

of course , the film could be seen as the reversed female version of the incredible shrinking man ( 1957 ) â though it wouldnât be fair to compare the two further , as the jack arnold / richard matheson classic is far more psychological / intellectual in approach ; actually , hayes doesnât seem to be that bothered with her âconditionâ and , in fact , takes advantage of it in order to teach her husband a lesson ! however , her rampage â exaggerated in movie posters of the era â is rather quaint ( especially when considering that it only occurs in the last ten minutes or so ) ; when not shown the damage caused by her enormous but highly unconvincing hand ( especially when lifting the puppet thatâs supposed to be her husband ! ) , sheâs mostly seen walking in long shot and almost from behind ( with her size even inconsistent in proportion to the buildings she passes by ) ! ! still , hayesâ demise via electrocution ( when she bumps into an electrical cable ) is competently done . 

finally , i followed this with its 1993 tv remake with daryl hannah as the titular creature â which i rented specifically for this purpose .  mediocre at best . slow , but probably more entertaining to the younger viewers . a young boy ( chris miller ) is haunted by an indian spirit and horrid monster in the cellar of his father ' s new home . also in the cast are patrick kilpatrick , suzanne savoy and ford rainey .  reading the other user comments , the review by a666333 has articulated most of what i was feeling throughout this film- predictable storyline , clichÃ© versions of lesbians / heterosexuals ( i . e . straight woman becomes a lesbian while concluding that her husband is abusive and aggressive ) . 

also , the score was severely disappointing . it was bland , soft , sentimental elevator music- another common clichÃ© in movies about lesbians . the movie would have had a few interesting dramatic moments if they had not been destroyed by the music . 

a few scenes concerning sex and eroticism also struck me as attempts to titillate and raise shock value , including parts of the final performance scene . the conventional " hot and steamy " moments were as boring as the overly sentimental score . for example during the pool scene , the women are kissing , and then the camera pans along the abandoned wine glass , the flowing water , the sound of their heavy breathing over the soft crashing of waves . 

the only elements i liked were the costuming and arobatics . they are well-choreographed , and the development of attraction between the two characters felt very natural during the training scenes . i genuinely smiled during those , and during the last scene with the police officer . but they were not enough to balance out the negatives or make me enjoy this film .  if one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture , one would prophesy a bright future for harold lloyd . unlike his competitors , he was comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage not a performed raised in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit . he had a good voice which matched his image . moreover , from 1924 on , his " silent " films had incorporated sequences based on sound gags lost on the audience ( e . g . , the bell sequence at the fall frolic from the freshman and the monkey sequence in the kid brother ) . yet lloyd ' s sound features consistently failed at the box office once the novelty of welcome danger had ebbed . lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources , but never realized that the glass character ' s enemy was not sound but the great depression . pre-depression audiences , giddy with optimism , may have rooted for this ambitious go-getter in whom they saw their surrogate ; depression audiences despised him as the person likely to foreclose on their mortgage and throw them in the gutter . compounding this problem of character choice is lloyd ' s perception as an insincere glad hander . sincerity , of course , is a subjective appraisal , but it is undeniable that lloyd , despite his own tragic upbringing , could never play a convincing down-and-outer . perhaps this is because he feared returning to that state permanently . the cat ' s-paw fails for these reasons , but it alone suffers from the revelation of lloyd ' s pro-fascist agenda . many film scholars believe that lloyd was prompted to make this film because he saw the presidency of fdr as a dictatorship bent on soaking the rich and soft on crime . we should remember that he was not alone in this feeling . demille had directed this day and age , a pro-police state drama , the previous year . we should also remember that america was founded by hotheaded tax protesters and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it . tcp suffered because it treated fascism lightly in a " comedy " and because its release was particularly ill-timed given the events in germany in that year . the production code of 1934 would ultimately curtail the glorification of vigilante justice and reaffirm the rule of constitutional law , cumbersome as it might be . the ideal of the benevolent despot , the good-intentioned all-powerful leader who brings about a utopia once freed of the checks and balances on this omnipotence , dates to classical antiquity . for this reason , totalitarian regimes fear laughter even though it acts as a safety valve . ironically , the mere existence of tcp , a film which demonizes the democratic experience of the country of its origin , shows that fdr ' s america was secure enough to accept criticism . one sees no parallel criticism in hitler ' s germany , stalin ' s ussr , or mussolini ' s italy . but can one laugh at the gallows humor of pending fascism ? lloyd ' s unnuanced film is skewed to the right and might have been written by dr goebbels himself if he ' d had a sense of humor , of course . it posits an alternative history in which a chosen one restores order and lost honor by any means necessary , and does so with good nature and fun . impending fascism approached by the left is , of course , chaplin ' s the great dictator . this latter film has the benefit of being set in another country and based on a thinly veiled actual persona and events . the great dictator produces few laughs today because it under-estimated the extent of human evil , but it succeeds despite its artless and inappropriate speechifying , because it has the distinct advantage of being vindicated by history . lloyd , however , should be credited for two things : first , he neither made any further pro-fascist films nor produced any subsequently hypocritically pro-allied films during the war : second , he never sold tcp to television . the post-1945 world had seen the face of fascism and it wasn ' t amusing .  man kills bear . man becomes bear . man / bear meets bear . man / bear stays man / bear after meeting bear . the end . seriously , that is the entire plot to this movie . yes , i simplified it to an extreme , but you get the picture . i just wish i maybe had not have seen it . 

the ' man / bear ' alluded to is a native american indian that kills a mother of a cub . and while that can be touching , it certainly lacks to really draw in on the potential conflict between the two parties . plus , there was a certain misuse of the two moose in the film . but that is beyond the point . 

overall , very much under par . certainly needed a lot more to be entertaining . maybe more laughs from the secondary characters and more drama between the two main bears . thats what separates bad films from the good ones . " d "  done in a mock-documentary style , late 60 ' s subversives and supposed detractors of the mainstream government are arrested and given a choice . upon sentencing for their wrong doings , there is a choice of going to prison for 7 years to life or spending three days and two nights in a southern california desert at punishment park . in the 100 degree heat , the prisoners are to trek fifty some odd miles to an american flag for their freedom . us and state law enforcers will follow two hours latter . if the dissidents are captured it means prison . 

appearing in this pseudo-documentary : carmen argenziano , katherine quittner , mary ellen kleinhall , stan armsted , scott turner , patrick boland and kent foreman .  i enjoyed the prequels , and found the relationship between tucker and chan previously hilarious . rh3 , however , was a re-hash of the first two without the charm or humor . i think i may have laughed once - and it was during the ngs . tucker was exceedingly annoying in this film , and his character didn ' t seem to have any purpose other than to bungle everything up in the most irritating way possible . chan is always likable , but he seemed tired in this film . i was able to predict everything - who the villain was , who the girl was , ( spoiler alert ) who the good-guy-turned-bad-guy was , etc . i hope to see more movies from tucker and chan in their separate endeavors , but not in any more rush hour sequels . it ' s just too tired . i recommend a rental , but not a purchase .  what a waste of talent -- although it appears that crudup in real life is a lot more like the vapid , self- absorbed , character-less character he portrays in this disappointing movie . 

in art , sometimes the empty spaces reveal more than the painted or created content . what this movie reveals is the unconsciousness and the contradictory / competing , unresolved impulses / consciousness of the film ' s director / writer . it unintentionally shows the lack of awareness that a truly evolved , deeply aware character should have and be tormented about in order to deserve audience empathy or sympathy or the lack of which is used to serve as a cautionary tale to the audience . but this film fails on either level in that regard . 

the fact that cal , the main character ( very much an antagonist , not a protagonist in the true sense of the word ) , has no empathy for anyone , especially those most deserving of it ( which does not include him ) and that he has such overblown , entitled , self-pitying , whiney sympathy only for himself , combined with the hallmark lack of remorse and no sense of guilt or awareness of his impact on others -- all converge in this film to make him the epitome of the self-involved , developmentally arrested , narcissistic sociopath -- somehow this is now the gold standard for males on film and in the world at this point and time . 

one of his counterpoints ( james legros ) states with a laser-true flash : " i bet you haven ' t done one good thing in life -- and i bet you won ' t " . it captures the absolute essence of the cal character . something the other characters he bulldozes over in the film seem to realize fairly quickly despite the director having stacked the deck to manipulate sympathy for cal . that is a testament to the supporting cast ' s talent and skills . 

cal ' s eventual ' return ' has nothing to do with character development , transformation or evolution of consciousness . it has only to do with the ultimate capitulation that until something better comes along , he may as well be back in his comfy cozy status quo of entitled enablement where the living is easy and no one will demand that he grow up--something of which he is willfully incapable and uninterested in doing . 

the film could have been pointed and intentional about showing the traps and tragedies -- the devastating effects of this kind of lack of conscience / consciousness , but it excuses and glorifies it instead -- in fact , it wallows in self-pity right along with the arrogant , selfish , emotionally stunted main character . 

 ( and it sure sent chills up my spine when thinking of the recent revelations about convicted murderer scott peterson ) . 

if you want to see crudup at his most nuanced and full of an exciting potential that has never been truly realized in my opinion , see the underrated ' inventing the abbotts ' . . . .  though the our gang comedies still have their followers , i ' ve got to say that their attempt to graduate to feature films , courtesy of hal roach came up way short . why did roach have to pick the civil war as is subject with all the attendant racism that would follow . 

dashing southern cavalier phillips holmes takes in young orphan spanky mcfarland and his young black friend buckwheat thomas after spanky inadvertently exposes a card cheat on a riverboat . all is placid and serene in the old south and then the civil war comes to ruin it for everybody . 

but even children can charm the worst in the world and there ' s none worse than those damn yankees . they just come south and ruin it for everybody . 

criticized though it was for its southern viewpoint , gone with the wind did make a good case for the southern cause and the blacks portrayed even though servile which they would be out of necessity are still three dimensional characters . hattie mcdaniel would not have won her oscar if it were not so . butterfly mcqueen ' s character of prissy as silly and vacuous as she was has some dimension . 

here though is maybe some of the worst racial stereotyping ever brought forth in hollywood . the companionship of spanky and buckwheat does show that kids get along , racial feelings are acquired not inbred . it ' s not the servility of the blacks that ' s objectionable , but there total acceptance of it . right from that horrible watermelon song , sung over the title credits , the message of general spanky is a bad one . 

yet it did get an oscar nomination for sound recording , probably one of the very few hal roach ever got out of the short subject field . 

general spanky is far from gone with the wind though .  i just finished watching this horribly depressing drama and realized that , in light of recent dramas such as these , the only ones who could be considered abnormal are those who are least aware that life is nothing more than tragic . i would suggest how nauseatingly defeatist and counter-productive this conclusion is , even if relationships and outlooks like those presented in this movie are grounded in fact to some degree . but , instead , i realized that these films have made the very determination of the great " tragedy " trivial when the same boring situations , the same suffocating dysfunctional families and friendships continue to play out just have they been over and over again in some sort of attempt to knock out previous distortions of family life ( much of it existing in the 1950s and earlier with personality and character aberrations being made ever so subtle ) , supplanting it instead with the " reality " of how things actually are . that in fact , what we are watching is no longer the dysfunctional , but in fact , a normal existence and set of circumstances that has actually existed all along , but of which we may have been previously been unaware and thus , have ignored or at least denied . 

only problem is , that too many films have been trying to make this point . and by doing so in nearly identical form . when i had read the synopsis for the film , i immediately thought of ' ice storm . ' while watching the depressing lifelessness of the travis family , which seemed to endure repeated emotional berating , i immediately recalled ' american beauty . ' and , in some regards , the interactions between the parents and the middle child , tim , i drew similarities from ' igby goes down . ' ' imaginary heroes ' may be a novel experience , maybe a refreshing one deemed so for an honest portrayal of character that , as said before , is often not permitted to exist in the films of family ( which is idiotic to think anyways , considering we were already seeing these kinds of relationships displayed in films like ' ordinary people ' as early as 1980 and which go back even further than that ) . but , to the well-versed viewer , these films may offer nothing new . they have in fact , become a rather tired testimony of too many filmmakers who may try to out-do the other with the amount of trauma and apathy they can pack into one family ( and here , it extends to neighbors and friends ) . in fact , ' imaginary heroes , ' the latest in this genre ( i do think there have been enough films to accurately declare it a ' genre ' ) , crams so many disasters and surprises into one family , that they would make prize finds for a daytime talk show host . it is the story of a family who is tested by the suicide of the eldest son , a talented and decorated swimmer who hated the sport with a passion . the youngest son knew this , the father was in a daze and blinded by the push for competitiveness in his all-star son . and it ' s not clear that the mother and sister had much of a relationship with the young man . 

granted , it is no less entertaining ( to some extent , for those who find this material exhaustively depressing after a while ) , and the performances are quite good , especially by sigourney weaver and jeff daniels . but , i sure hope that filmmakers in the future wishing to add to the commentary of struggling familial relationships ( which coincidentally or not always seem to be upper-middle class white suburban families ) intend to offer something new by way of material and insight . i should see no distinction ( and consequently , no purpose ) otherwise .  for producer david o . selznick , no one director would ever do . hence , on " a farewell to arms " ( 1957 ) we get two Â charles vidor and john huston . though both men were quite accomplished in their own right , neither could make head or tail of this disastrous remake of hemmingway ' s magnum opus . hemmingway in general has never translated well from book to screen . but under selznick ' s zeal to transform it into his next ' gone with the wind ' the excursion is both punishing and exhaustive . at this point in selznick ' s career , he was no longer the titan who could take " box office poison " and transform it into gone with the wind . tired , frail , minus his studio , and , with an impending sense that his second marriage to jennifer jones might have been a mistake , selznick handed the creative reigns of this flick over to fox studios Â but he kept enough of himself in it to become a damn nuisance on the set . 

by now one is , or should be familiar with the bittersweet tragic love story of a nurse , catharine barkley ( jennifer jones ) and her soldier hero , lt . frederick henry ( rock hudson ) . their passion is supposed to serve as the stabilizing force for what is essentially a war correspondent ' s tale with romanticism thrown in for good measure . but the chemistry between hudson and jones is both turgid and dull . in the final reel , jones ' facial contortions during child birth are so bad i am surprised that neither director opted to cut them from the general release . part of the problem with jones is that at thirty-eight she ' s far too wise to play the optimistic catharine with any great conviction . yet , older actresses have frequently managed to make an audience forget discrepancies in age . not so with jones . one is painfully aware that she doesn ' t fit the bill in either acting chops or years invested on this planet . hudson ' s laconic charm is hopelessly out of touch with to stoicism of an army soldier whose heart is broken but head remains strong . the supporting cast is peppered with such luminaries as vittorio de sica and mercedes mccambridge , but these are wasted bits of nonsense that in no way reflect upon the formidable talents of either actor and best made evident elsewhere in their canons of film making . 

the anamorphic picture element for " a farewell to arms " looks good enough , though there ' s just a bit too much film grain present in certain scenes for this reviewer ' s liking . overall , colors are subtle and muted , though balanced in accordance with the deluxe color processing employed at this time . some fading is evident . flesh tones don ' t appear very natural . contrast levels are a tad weak . blacks are generally solid . whites are almost clean . there ' s not much to recommend this film sonically . it ' s essentially a wordy picture with gun shots as a backdrop . there are no extras .  abderrahmane sissako may have known what he was doing when he made " bamako , " but the rest of us can just sit back in mystification and confusion trying to figure out what that purpose might have been . 

the nominal " plot " involves a young african singer who ' s planning on leaving her unemployed husband to find work in the city . but far more of the screen time is taken up with what the publicists for the film describe as " a mock trial against key financial institutions " dealing " with the overwhelming economic hardships of africa . " that ' s all well and good , i suppose , but when the arguments and ideas are put forth in as undramatic and pedantic a way as they are here , they lose both force and impact . put another way , if the director had found the means to actually incorporate issues such as the injurious effect of colonialism on the african people and the problem of african debt into anything even remotely resembling a compelling storyline , the film might have achieved the intellectual and emotional resonance it now so clearly lacks . 

the topics the movie is dealing with may be relevant and important , but trying to pass off what amounts to two hours worth of speechifying as an actual , honest-to-god movie is not likely to garner much of an audience for one ' s message .  here is another low quality movie from the " disney " company . there is no more disney spirit . the story is boring . all emotions are fake . it is not cute or moving . disney company was at a time a sort of magic company which provided dreams for children . it is now all about making money . shame on the people who exploit disney name for their personal benefit . it is the fall of an empire . and , by the way , pixar is not disney !  what was this , a zucker brothers movie ? i don ' t mind a little humor in my holmes ( i ' m a big fan of billy wilder ' s " the private life of sh " ) , but this version of " the sign of four " feels like a grand-guignol-esque episode of " murder , she wrote " ( right from the opening credits , that are of the worst possible kind : a montage of scenes from the movie ) as directed by mel brooks . ian richardson is a fine actor , and certainly looks the part ( he ' s a dead ringer to those drawings from the strand ! ) , but his interpretation of the character is all wrong and overly humorous , from the silly smile he frequently sports ( i thought the drug holmes was into was cocaine , not weed ) to his expressions of comical stiffness in the carnival sequences . not to mention that when he disguises himself as an old man , he is so over the top that despite the fine makeup we instantly recognize him . david healy is an unmemorable but , given the circumstances , acceptable watson , and is not too much of a buffoon . . . at least not more than the rest of characters . cherie lunghi ( excalibur ) plays mary morstan in an exaggerated ingenue fashion straight out of a 1930s vaudeville . 

story-wise , there are some pointless additions ( like giving tonga vampire teeth , an appetite for raw meat and a carnival pit as a place to live , turning him into a reject from island of dr . moreau ) , and we are even denied the pleasure of discovering the mystery alongside holmes , as we are well informed of everything way before holmes finds out . and this is full of tired clichÃ©s : not only we get the infamous catchphrase " elementary , my dear watson " ( which , as any sherlockian will know , conan doyle never ever wrote ) , but we are exposed to such blatant commonplaces as having hindi music pop out of nowhere when holmes goes to see a white guy in hindi clothes . 

bottom line : in britain , in the eighties , two rival tv companies attempted to create a long-running series of sherlock holmes adaptations , and produced initial tv-movies as potential pilots . one of them starred ian richardson , the other starred jeremy brett . thankfully , the one that got its way through multiple episodes was the good one ! 

3 / 10 . travesty .  this movie is one of the poorest adaptations of a fabulous book that i ' ve seen . jean george ' s novel is a fantastic book that i think is an outstanding read for any child . i can ' t give the same endorsement to this movie .  mel welles , you might remember him as mr . mushnick in roger corman ' s little shop of horrors , directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of dr . frankenstein ' s daughter carrying on her father ' s work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to be / do good but rather for its sex appeal . you see , tania frankenstein , though a doctor and scientist in her own right , is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love . the story is tissue-thin here , and one gets what one might expect : lots of leering and suggestive comments ( surprisingly most from the female lead ) , special effects that are not so special , acting that lacks depth of characterization , and not really much action or suspense . and while this film is almost barren in regards to good storytelling , lady frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which make it watchable - not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless . italian actress rosalba neri aka sara bay / bey plays the baron ' s daughter with some aplomb and lots and lots of sex appeal . she oozes desire and seduction quite well . her performance is pretty one-dimensional , but she is quite lovely and plays over-the-top a little too well . she is also very open with her performance if you catch my drift . poor joseph cotten , now regulated to european horror films for money , plays the father in a brief yet competent performance . he is the star attraction but gone before the film really kicks into a gear . as for the rest of the cast , paul muller is somewhat effective as dr . charles marshall , the baron ' s assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time . as crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village , policeman ( i wasn ' t buying this ) mickey hargitay starts to pump tania for answers - despite what you might think not to her satisfaction . where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the film where the suspect script , weak performances , and lackluster direction all head further south . the creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous . the film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the 1970s . while not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think , lady frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with some perverse albeit intriguing overtones .  while credited as a tom and jerry cartoon , this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier mutt-and-jeff rip-off featuring them going to africa and disguising themselves in the stereotypical burnt cork makeup to try to blend in . while the dialect humor is mostly lame , there is a brief musical sequence involving " black skeletons " that was entertaining . i have to ask however , how could tom and jerry still have their makeup stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of times ? one of many entries produced by the van beuren corporation for distribution by rko radio pictures before rko made a deal with disney . only worth seeing if you ' re an animation buff or is interested in how certain ethnicities were stereotyped as entertainment way back when .  there is a special heaven reserved for people who make the world laugh . alongside chaplin , stan and ollie , the marx bros and . . . . . ( fill in your own special favourites ) space must be made for everybody connected with " airport 80 - concorde , the movie " . robert wagner in particular exceeds all expectations giving the comedy performance of a lifetime . i would never have thought he had it in him . the only way he could have been funnier would have been to have worn a red nose and a revolving bow tie . british moviegoers will recognise the fat one from cannon and ball pretending to be a russian athlete , a nice trick if he could have pulled it off but , tragically , he couldn ' t . i have a 14 year old labrador more athletic and almost as funny . george kennedy - bless him - has a part that requires him talk and move at the same time , and my goodness he triumphs ! brow wrinkled with effort he utters timeless dialogue , each word lovingly polished into coward-like brilliance . only once in twenty years does hollywood turn out a film like " airport 80 " . all the years of toil and struggle , the sweat , the tears , the lessons with lee strasberg , living out of suitcases , born in a trunk etc etc , all come to fruition . a work of art is created that will last as long as there are movies and machines to show them on . i think i ' m ready for my medication now .  below average blaxpoitation action / melodrama in which the lovely ms . grier plays a private eye who comes to the aid of her father ( rudy challenger ) and his partner ( austin stoker of the original " assault on precinct 13 " ) whose loan business is being threatened . 

i ' ll be frank - i agree with the few other user comments for this movie . " sheba , baby " has a less than satisfying script , direction that isn ' t particularly distinguished , action scenes that are moderately entertaining at best , and one of ms . grier ' s more nondescript supporting casts ( although there ' s an important supporting role for d ' urville martin , also a familiar name in blaxpoitation ) . i get the feeling that this routine movie may have been put together quickly merely to cash in on her then enormous popularity . 

it sure was cool seeing stoker again , although ms . grier doesn ' t have as good a role - or dialog - as she has had in other films , although she is doing what she does best , and that ' s playing a sassy , sexy sister on a mission of vengeance . 

non-stop soul / funk soundtrack is enjoyable , at the very least . 

mostly recommended to those who wish to see everything in the pam grier film repertoire . 

4 / 10 i bought this dvd as part of a set of 50 " historic classics . " it ' s hardly a classic , and as the plot was updated to the time of its release , is not historic either . the actual title on the dvd is " indecent , " and additionally subtitled " the private life of becky sharp . " myrna loy is not very convincing , although in her defense she is saddled with an awful script and trite dialogue . as with many early talkies , and especially ones made by smaller studios , there is little skill demonstrated by the cast and crew . loy does wear a few gowns that are quite stylish , but her costumes and make-up in the later scenes are overdone . the one saving grace is a tolerable performance by billy bevan , who plays one of her many suitors this very loose retelling of carmen begins on a high note with a smoldering , sexually-frank dance between senaglese prisoner " karmen " and her female prison warden , but the vibrant opening minutes never ignite into any coherent film . one minute karmen is all sexual predator , the next she is dancing in protest to her unfair government , and then suddenly she is a smuggler on the high seas . . . although the film deserves kudos for postulating the first carnivorously bisexual " karmen , " the broad strokes it paints are so vignette-like and unsupported by any narrative coherence that the film comes off as a schizophrenic , undisciplined melange of " basic-instinct " meets " bound " meets an african version of a bollywood musical .  this is truly a re-make that should never have gotten out of the stable . it has two casts that are acting in entirely different strata . at the top of their game are joan plowright and maximillian schell . every nuance of the franks is in plain sight . at the rock bottom are melissa gilbert and doris roberts . i cannot imagine how schell and plowright manage to play so well when gilbert and roberts are working their anti-magic . gilbert ruins every scene she ' s in . it ' s like father knows best in the ghetto . she ' s ann frank light . her run at helen keller was thin but not awful . this is sacrilege . doris roberts makes mrs . van damm merely annoying . she is a completely inappropriate choice to play the sexually hungry woman whose flirtatious , dissatisfied presence caused so much trouble in het acherhuis . this needed to be played by a woman who could convince us that she at least remembered what it was like to voluptuous . her weight is not the problem . joan plowright could have played this part beautifully . roberts was on a career high when this was made , getting lots of press and many opportunities . her performance here displays her weaknesses as an actress shamefully . 

james coco and clive reville , have most of their scenes with gilbert and roberts , and , strong though they are , they are completely incapable of undoing the damage done by their partners . reville is a wily actor capable of the kind of iconic performance given by ed wynne in the original film . he gets no support from gilbert . she drain the color out of every scene . 

i ' ve read with dismay the comments by those of you who grew up watching this version , filled with attachment to these performances . it ' s a lesson in how the version you see first attachs to you . it makes me reconsider my attachment to some inferior products i loved in my childhood . i encourage you to watch the original . it has very few weak spots and it ' s head and shoulders above this mess .  a cheesy " b " crime thriller of the early ' 50 , the story is droll , the characters wooden , allison hayes and abbe lane are the only two sexpots that make it an eye-catcher , but one short shot , only a few frames long , shows an " el " train crossing the river on the state street bridge , of the 6000 series pullman-built cars painted in their original 1950 paint scheme , as they were delivered when new in 1950 . for traction fans like me , that one short take makes the picture worthwhile . i think films like this one , ulmer ' s detour , d . o . a . with edmund o ' brien , the fugitive with harrison ford , and others of the film noir genre , ( big city crime dramas ) make it interesting if for nothing other than the fact that i know chicago and san francisco intimately and recognize most of the street locations . other wise it ' s a really droll boring film !  voor een verloren soldaat , for a lost soldier , is a sad example of how not to translate to film a touching , complex psychological study , of that most magical time in a man ' s life , when he is still a child , but starting to become a man . the novel records the real life experiences of rudy van dantzig , as told thru the boy jeroen , during the waning days of wwii at age 11 as he deals with his incipient sexuality , and his deep fears of abandonment as he has been sent to the province of friesland , north of holland by his parents because of the lack of food in amsterdam and has not heard from them in many months as the postal service has broken down . . the arrival of the liberating soldiers in the film , is presented in a painfully corny way , with the soldiers providing entertainment vaudeville style . then one soldier , walt , romances jeroen and the pair is presented as two frolicking males . who consummate their love in a sexual experience . this taken in stride by the 11 yo jeroen . the reality was somewhat different : jeroen describes his encounters with walt , 6 in all , in detail but in oblique language . but there is no misunderstanding their nature . walt is aroused to an intense passion by jeroen , during which he handles him roughly , so that in their final meeting , jeroen is bruised and suffering a painful wound on the shoulder where walt has bitten him . during this encounter , walt rapes jeroen , twice . jeroen could have easily avoided walt after their 2nd encounter , when walt first assaults him as walt is clearly anxious to keep his abuse of the boy from the other soldiers . why jeroen keeps seeking walt out is a mystery of the human heart and not explainable , by me anyway . what the film leaves out is the aftermath : the nightmares , the dejection , the frantic search throughout amsterdam on the chance of finding walt , for jeroen loved walt , and nothing could shake that .  there were many ' spooky ' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s , and although this has a strong beginning , it isn ' t one . randy bowers ( john wayne ) stopping at a ' halfway house ' saloon , finds it to be full of dead bodies , the bartender ' s corpse draped over the bar holding a gun , eyes watching randy from behind holes cut through eyes in a picture , and a player piano playing " the loveliest night of the year . " 

it was the result of a robbery by the marvin black gang , to get ed rogers ' $ 30 , 000 . randy is an investigator who " works alone , " who wastes little time in getting arrested , escaping ( with ed ' s daughter sally ' s help ) and literally landing in the midst of the black gang ' s hideout behind a waterfall . it all moves along fairly quickly . only one too many chases after randy slow it down . 

we even get george hayes , clean shaven and playing two parts-- marvin black , the vilest villain , as well as the good citizen , matt the mute , who communicates via handwritten messages . having him play two opposite roles was a good idea , but the writing down of messages thing gets old real fast , even for him , as he finally gives up doing it near the end saying to sally , " ah , i ' m fed up with this ! " you can find george playing a vile , vile , double crossing villain in the serial " the lost city " ( 1934 ) . 

i think this is the only ' lone star ' film in which the title relates to , or is mentioned in the film ! sally offers her hand to randy and says , " he ' s not alone anymore ! " then cut to their arms around each other as they look out facing a lake . sally ' s running off with randy seems too abrupt and not sufficiently prepared for . too much time spent on horseback escaping the sheriff . 

not that bad considering everything , but not that great either . i ' d really give it a 4 and a half .  for me this movie is essentially like a feature length pilot episode for a tv series . it reminds me particularly of the british remake of the tv series wallander , starring kenneth brannagh . people interviewed by the police are hardy , and often as bitter as the weather , the lead investigator has huge family problems , investigations invariably lead to cruelties of the distant past , and the plotting is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and subplots making sense only at the end . both have excellent cinematography . 

the plotting of jar city is extraordinarily reminiscent of a standard uk or us crime series . effectively you could take the plots of any of the episodes of touch of frost and transplant them on top of the bleak locale in this movie and have an effective sequel . 

really the script couldn ' t be more obviously from the cookie cutter . you get even the most familiar of motifs , such as the police going to the local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath , who inevitably explodes at the end of the interview . 

i ' m absolutely convinced that this is scones and jam for many folk , but i feel it needs pointing out to people like myself who do not go to the cinema to watch television . what i felt a keen lack of was message . the movie takes as its theme the genetic studies in iceland . icelanders in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world , presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics . lots of information concerning the heredity of the population has been kept , and many genetic diseases unique to iceland can be traced effectively in a population that has refrained from interbreeding , and is remarkably genetically homogeneous ( it ' s like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle of the london underground map , instead of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of daisies ) . a company called decode genetics attempted to set up a database carrying all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of iceland . due to privacy concerns this project was terminated , and at the end of last year decode genetics went bankrupt in iceland . the episode is a rich topic for debate . 

but in this movie genetics and medical science are not there for education ' s sake , they ' re there for weird atmosphere . 

it ' s a grisly movie if you are interested in that , and there ' s often a morbid focus on food to accompany events , like a coroner who eats lunch in between incisions . the most queasy for me was when the lead inspector devours a sheep ' s head . unfortunately for me this occasionally became farcical . the movie attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the grisly with the sentimental , and ended up providing unintentional humour towards the end . this is the equivalent , in cinematic terms , of attempting to prepare fugu , if you ' re not well-qualified , deft of hand and sharp of eye , you poison the client . this rather novice director should have lowered the tariff on his performance . 

i walked out of this movie feeling rather bad about myself and about life in general .  fc de kampioenen ' s only reason for existence is it ' s local popularity . it has caused this sitcom to run for over 15 years ( and still counting ) . 

it deals about an amateur soccer team with the emphasis " amateur " . every storyline deals with the same subject : some misunderstanding that takes ridiculous ( and predictable ) proportions , to get resolved in the end . 

the show ' s been running for over 15 years now , and the production probably decided not to change a winning team . which means that the show has had minor changes over the course of years ( besides a couple of actors getting replaced ( they nearly all left by themselves rather than being thrown of the show ) ) . the humor hasn ' t changed a bit over the years and it was already outdated when it first aired in the first place . 

i guess you have to be flemish to get this , and over 60 years old , to enjoy such an old fashioned tv show as this .  set in the mid 1800 ' s when the british is clearing new zealand outback wilderness to establish colonies . the daughter of a british army surgeon , sarah ( samantha morton ) , falls in love with the son of one of the maori leaders . the maori is an indigenous tribe and a dangerous people for the europeans to deal with . by the time sarah ' s child , which she calls " boy " , is born , his father is dead . by the age of six , " boy " is kidnapped by his father ' s family and sarah will begin her search for him with a man ( kiefer sutherland ) , who is deeply in love with her . 

two-time oscar nominee morton is definitely the star of this movie . sutherland is a total waste . also starring are : cliff curtis , stephen rea , temuera morrison and david rawiri pene . this movie is rated r for some sexual content and violent battle scenes . i find the title river queen very misleading and the dvd cover with sutherland only and making you believe he is the leading star should be a crime .  i had high hopes for this one after reading earlier reviews but it was so slow and the plot so basic that well i wondered if i had read the wrong reviews . 

please , a boy meets girl next door at 11 and both aspire to love and being basketball legends . grow apart , but watch each others progress . guess what ! both get scholarships to same university and become lovers again until his father is caught out playing around with a younger woman . our young hero unable to cope has lapse in court concentration but some how decides to go pro and drop studies , and guess what is picked up by lakers . dumps the heroine because she was not there for him during this emotional period . so for 5 years they go their own way . she returns from spain having lost the zest for the game and our hero is getting married in two weeks . mom tells her that she should fight for her love so she professes her on-going love and challenges him to a basketball shootout . he wins he marries she wins he loves her . well he won but decides to dump other girl for our girl . the end has her playing basketball and he has baby duties . sorry 2 is my high score . my partner she scored 0 for a soapy story for those who read mills and boon the story starts off in the home of a little girl who is going to have a birthday party and both the mother and father seemed to act rather quiet and reserved with each other . they proceed to give their daughter her present which is from both of them and it stuck me funny the expressions on the two parents faces as they gave their child this gift , it was almost like , ' i hope she likes it ' ! there is a killing in the film and catherine mary stewart , ( julia kerbridge ) , " reaper " , 2000 , gets involved with the case because of family ties . julia is working hard to become a doctor and this particular murder disrupts her entire life . rob lowe , ( kevin finney ) , " view from the top " , 03 is a next door neighbor in the same apartment dwelling as julia and he eventually goes to bed with her and tries to help her in other ways . this is not a bad film , but it is certainly nothing to go crazy about , unless you like a film location in canada and a good looking catherine mary stewart , a native from canada .  i was in 6th grade and this movie aired on pbs during a series called ' wonderworks . ' i distinctly remember sitting on a couch watching the movie with tears running down my face at the end . in the film jesse , the main character , forms an unusual friendship with a girl named leslie . due to a very simple , but careless mistake one of the pair dies . at the time , i found the story very powerful , because the fatal mistake is exactly the type of mistake a kid would make and so any kid watching the film will find it very easy to identify with and feel the emotional weight of the tragedy that ensues . 

last year , i finally tracked down a vhs copy of the show . i probably should have stuck with my memories . watching the show as an adult i was absolutely shocked by what a horribly made film this was . my girlfriend had a similar memory of the movie as well , and she too was pretty sad about how bad the movie was compared to her memories . 

many adults probably have a good memory of watching this movie when they were kids . i strongly advise that these people leave their memories intact , and avoid seeing this film as an adult .  dustin hoffman ' s debut feature isn ' t as bad as it ' s reputed to be ; a spanish / italian co-production filmed in italy with the director using the pseudonym " dan ash " ( ! ) , the film is uneven but generally diverting and deals with a plethora of shady characters in search of a $ 1 , 000 , 000 hidden by gangster cesar romero ( who , despite being third-billed - after elsa martinelli and hoffman himself - expires before the credit sequence has even rolled ! ) . 

hoffman ' s performance , obviously , is nowhere near as nuanced as in later films but manages to dodge embarrassment by playing what basically amounts to an amiable klutz - an accident-prone american treasury agent of sicilian descent ( named puzzu , which nobody seems to be able to get right ! ) sent out by his firm to retrieve the money and told to remain " inconspicuous " but , instead , is forever getting into trouble - though he ultimately proves surprisingly resourceful by finding the loot , foiling the crooks and winning the girl ( martinelli as romero ' s daughter , who ' s somewhat wasted here ) ! ! 

still , the film ' s best moments are provided by suave gangster riccardo garrone : apart from his would-be hard-boiled persona and the hilarious use of dialect , he ' s flanked by a trio of nitwits who more often than not prove a hindrance in the fulfillment of his various schemes ! also , in view of the story being set in rome , it ' s odd that the police officer investigating the case is a spaniard ( doubtless an exigency of the co-production deal ) ! 

along the years , i ' ve missed out on hoffman ' s other italian comedy - alfredo , alfredo ( 1972 ) - a number of times ( i guess , mainly , because leonard maltin only rates it * 1 / 2 in his " movies & video guide " . . . but , then , madigan ' s million gets a bomb ! ) ; with pietro germi directing and co-starring the luscious stefania sandrelli , the credentials of that film are certainly more respectable , and i really hope it turns up again on italian tv soon . . .   " undercurrent " features a top-notch cast of wonderful actors who might ' ve been assembled for the perfect drawing-room comedy . alas , they are pretty much wasted on a ' woman ' s view ' potboiler--and a paper-thin one at that . katharine hepburn is indeed radiant as a tomboy / old maid who finally marries , but her husband is deeply disturbed and harboring dark family secrets . director vincente minnelli has absolutely no idea how to mount this outlandish plot , concocted by edward chodorov from a story by thelma strabel , and the friendly , first-rate cast ( including robert taylor , robert mitchum and edmund gwenn ) is left treading in murky waters . * * from * * * *  you belong to me ( 1941 ) is a example of the ' screwball comedy ' which started in the mid 1930s and ended postwar ( wwii ) . some of these films maintained their status . others have earned undeserved praise when originally were critical and box office flops . like bringing up baby ( 1938 ) or mr . & mrs . smith ( 1941 ) . then there is this one which value just keeps sinking . 

why can be rooted in the screenplay / story . it strains credibility from the get go , betraying a superior cast . barbara stanwyck is married to millionaire henry fonda who is insanely jealous . he would be content to sit back with his million $ and love her , she wishes to maintain her profession as a doctor . she wants him to become in what her eyes is a useful member of society . this conflict is supposed to amuse us . it cannot be salvaged by either the principals or the supporting cast . 

the faults in this scenario can clearly be laid at the feet of dalton trumbo . henry fondas ' character is written in such broad strokes that any viewer has a instant dislike for him . barbara stanwyck just has nothing to do but react to each idiotic situation of jealousy . trumbo must have been spending to much time outside the studio being a " useful idiot " then being on the job . columbia obviously did not get their moneys worth from him , maybe robert riskin should taken over .  it ' s really a shame to see so many talented people involved in what ' s happen to be a very waste of talents . the plot is clichÃ© . the directing is too self conscious and the characters are almost caricatures . one of the most disappointing aspect of this film is gerard depardieu ' s performance in the english version ( this movie was shot in french and english at the same time ) . although he is one of the best actor in the film , he gives the worst performance of them all . i must say that bianca gervais come very close though . . . 

on a more positive note i must say that the newcomer juliette gosselin gives an amazing performance in both version . unfortunately that the only good thing i remember about this film . . . 

by the way i must apologize for my not very good english . . .  

summary : not worth the film

as an avid gone with the wind fan , i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters . luckily , the film on its own was a wonderful piece . when the book scarlett came out , i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together . while the book lacks any true quality , it remains a good story , and , as long as i was able to separate it from the original , was and still is enjoyable . however , i consider the six hours i spent watching the " scarlett " miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life . discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in margaret mitchell ' s book , this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape , mistrust , murder , and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from . the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film , and even carried through in the second book , and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character . in the novel , scarlett o ' hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family . after coming to an " arrangement " with rhett , she agrees to leave , and proceeds to reconnect with her o ' hara relatives in savannah . eventually , she accompanies her cousin colum , a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood , to ireland , to further explore her family ' s " roots that go deep , " and is eventually named " the o ' hara , " the head of the family . while her duties as the o ' hara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara , scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners , and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties . she , having been scorned by rhett time and time again , eventually agrees to marry luke , the earl of fenton , until rhett comes along in a clichÃ©d " night-on-white-horse " - type of a rescue . the " scarlett " miniseries fails even to do this justice . raped by her fiancÃ© and scorned by her family , the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed . 

i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision . 

 eugene o ' neill ' s 4 and a half hour 1927 play brought to the screen in less than two hours . the play ' s combination of symbolic dialogue and gothic melodrama hasn ' t aged very well and the cast has some difficulty with it , especially norma shearer ' s nina and ralph morgan ' s marsden . clark gable as ned darrell comes off better but mostly because his is a gruff character not given to the philosophical musings of the others which better fits gable ' s range . once the plot settles down to the love quadrangle and the audience adjusts to the voiceover asides the film does become more enjoyable . the technique used here for the asides is another problem . on stage the action froze while the actors spoke their thoughts to the audience . here they ' re done as voiceovers . you ' d think that would work better but since the action no longer freezes the actors are forced to pause speaking and grimace at the camera to match the emotions in their thoughts . plus it ' s difficult for any movie buff to watch this film and not think of groucho marx ' s hilarious parody version in " animal crackers . " added to these drawbacks are some cuts made for censorship reasons ( nina ' s promiscuity is soft-peddled and there is no mention of her getting the abortion that is more central in the play ) and a wretched score ( uncredited ) that sounds like background music to a turn-of-the-century weepie . o ' neill called this film " a dreadful hash of attempted condensation and idiotic censorship , " and although " strange interlude " is nowhere near as great as his later " the iceman cometh " and " long day ' s journey into night , " it certainly deserved better than this .  thunderball and never are two of the biggest box office misses and never is a surprise farce from empire strikes back hero irvin kershner . klaus maria brandauer seems to steal the show , when , in the midst of the unfolding plot , bond ' s mission turns more to hollywood romp ( sometime around when basinger comes in ) . how about klaus kinski ? i still think that the casting of largo makes or , as is evident in both films , breaks the story . worst of all is the attempt to pass off the aging and very hairy connery off as the sex symbol he indeed was in the ' 60s . the ' 80s was a barren time for bond flicks mostly , though for your eyes only is a great title . at times , when i happen to need to waste some time over the holidays by watching this film in the often string of bond re-run festivals , i think the best attribute of the film is its score , and i ' m not into soft ' 80s ' jazz ' .  this film is strange , even for a silent movie . essentially , it follows the adventures about a engineer in post-revolutionary russia who daydreams about going to mars . in this movie , it seems like the producers know the communists have truly screwed up the country , but also seems to want to make it look like they ' ve accomplished something good . 

then we get to the " martian " scenes , where everyone on mars wears goofy hats . they have a revolution after being inspired by the earth men , but are quickly betrayed by the queen who sides with them . except it ' s all a dream , or is it . ( and given that the russian revolution eventually lead to the stalin dictatorship , it makes you wonder if it was all allegory . ) 

now , i ' ve seen good russian cinema . for instance , eisenstein ' s battleship potemkin is a good movie . this is just , well , silly .  james marsh ' s the king is a film that mystifies me . i can ' t think what its meant to be for . it ' s a story about a young man called elvis played by gael garcia bernal who gets an honourable discharge after 3 years navy service and then goes off to find his biological father and behaves dishonourably with him and his family . it ' s all rather sick really . elvis worms his way into the family by seducing his 16 year old sister malerie ( pell james ) . it ' s rather impossible to identify with anyone in this film from here in middle england . preacher father and bouncy joyful christian congregation ; i couldn ' t work out whether the film is meant to be deriding them for their mindless beliefs . or is the target the happy family and we are meant to think that ' s unviable . or is it just saying that some people are lost and just hell bent on destruction . it ' s shallow . we all know that bad things happen ; the interesting bit is to learn why but this film just gratuitously depicts a violence without ever unravelling the thinking that has led to it . " the king " is such a lost opportunity . there are some really interesting questions about honour ; the warrior code ; the changing concepts of valour ; honour killings in indian families and so on . honour is a very varied concept . but this film just adds nothing to the notion . however , paul the projectionist did more than his meagre role suggests . the dvd projector showed all films in a green-only hue and the only way to repair this was to get it sent to belgium . he did this through christmas . i think those postal workers and repairers and paul went far beyond the call of duty and our reward was this dismal film . but you might see it differently ?  this is a bottom of the barrel type of b-film from one of the poverty row studios , monogram , in the mid- ' 40s , the kind that filled out a double bill . 

only reason i watched was to see what jackie moran was like in a leading role as a page boy at a radio station who attempts to solve a murder . he played phil meade in gone with the wind only two years earlier and this was one of his last teen-aged roles . he ' s no mickey rooney . 

the script is as hapless as the production values and is full of clichÃ© ridden situations with a cast of uniformly untalented individuals . wanda mckay is the switchboard girl who is " discovered " by a radio producer and sidney miller is the nerdy friend of the hero who ' s afraid of his own shadow . 

mercifully , it ' s over in an hour when the murder is solved after a round-up of all the suspects . terribly overacted , the only quiet performance of any interest is given by jon gilbreath as tex , the cowboy , but he bites the dust after too brief an appearance . 

there are several songs , but all of them are forgettable , as are the lame jokes and dialog .  sadly a great opportunity to utilise a superb cast to bring king lear up to date . however , instead , we got a contrived family drama that appeared to dip into lear when the writer had run out of ideas , the cast worked hard but it just didn ' t gel . recently stephen harrigan showed how to adapt and update the classics with his screenplay for the magnificent tv movie " king of texas " .  while walking to buy cigarettes , the professional dancer daniel ( tom long ) is abducted and forced to have kinky sex along many days by three hooded women . when he is released , the director of his company isabel ( greta scacchi ) has already replaced him in the play and his girlfriend gives a cold reception to him . the disturbed and humiliated daniel leaves the dance company and travels obsessed to seek out the abductors . daniel has sex with many women that he suspects that might be the kidnappers . 

 " the book of revelation " is a weird movie with a promising beginning that loses the initial power and becomes a sort of too long erotic soap- opera or soft-porn chic . the production is classy , the cover of the dvd is awesome but the characters are not well-developed and the trauma of daniel seems to be excessive since most of the men would fantasize with the dream-situation that he was submitted Â to become sexual object of three sexy women . the melodramatic development with the illness of isabel does not add any value to the plot ; the open conclusion is very disappointing and there are no explanations for the motive of the women or the title . it is very clear that the screenplay about a man ' s feelings was written by a woman . it was good to see the still beautiful greta scacchi again and her make-up in the end is impressive . there is a saying in portuguese that could be translated to english as follows : " if the rape is inevitable , relax and come . " daniel should have done this and spared me of watching almost two hours of a pointless story . my vote is four . 

title ( brazil ) : " o livro das revelaÃ§Ãµes " ( " the book of revelations " )  while it was nice to see a film about older people finding each other and falling in love and the performances by andrews and garner were not bad , this picture poured on the sapp and schmaltz at every turn . every curve in the plot was in view from a mile away !  this was a very nice concert by the one and only mj . the choreography was excellent and the costumes were decent . the vocals were okay . i have to admit that his vocals were crap on human nature and billie jean . you couldn ' t hear him half the time . the other songs make up for the singing . the highlights of the show are : jam smooth criminal i just can ' t stop loving you she ' s out of my life thriller billie jean ( the dancing not the singing ) black or white man in the mirror the concert was almost perfect . if it was anybody but mj it would have been a 9 . it is a must see . i wish i was born then so i could have gotten a ticket to the best concert of 1992 .  with the plethora of repetitive and derivative sitcoms jamming fall , summer , winter and spring line-ups , it ' s nice to see a show that sets itself from the lot in more than one area . 

 ' earl ' takes an unusual approach . it ' s not about the " daily musings of an eccentric family " ( zzzz . . ) nor about the other boring stuff you see everywhere in sitcoms . the show is about this small-time white trash thief ( earl ) who scratches off a lottery card and scores big time . right at that moment , ' karma ' took it away from him . overtime , he learns that that unusual incident was probably because of all the bad things he ' s been doing , so he sets off on a mission to right every wrong he ever did and he ' s got all his deeds on a paper . 

this is a brilliant premise for a sitcom . thankfully , it landed in the right hands . the execution of the show produces extremely satisfactory results : you get an innovative comedy that is genuinely funny and really touching at many times . you can ' t help but fall in love with earl ' s sincerity and steadfastness , randy ' s simple mind , good heart and observations on life , joy ' s wild , flamboyant personality and darnell ' s mellow , chillin ' demeanor that really endears him to you very easily . 

when you combine the show ' s innovation with its genuine humor , good heart , interesting characters and well-written dialogue , you really have a keeper . with shows like this ( and the incomparable " the office " ) , nbc is obviously on to something . did they finally free a cubicle or two for quality assurance ? let ' s hope so . and let ' s hope for more quality shows like these will occupy the line-ups ; shows that ' ll make both us tv viewers and nbc executives stop crying over the long gone days of nbc ' s golden days ( frasier , seinfeld , friends )  pretty lousy made-for-tv sequel to the roman polanski classic . rosemary ' s son adrian has grown up and is embodied by creepy stephen mchattie . after eliminating rosemary ( here played by patty duke ) a coven of witches , again led by minnie & roman castevets , preps satan ' s son for world domination . it ' s not really scary and light years less macabre than its predecessor . instead , writer anthony wilson and director sam o ' steen opt for a satan-worshiping thriller full of a lot of chanting , plenty of candles , and ruth gordon trying to act daffy and nasty at the same time . gordon ' s the sole holdover from the original . george maharis replaces john cassavetes as guy and a very hammy ray milland plays roman castevets , subbing for the late sidney blackmer . newcomer mchattie is the film ' s only real saving grace . he ' s very off-kilter and looks really sinister without even doing anything . the music by charles bernstein is suitably creepy , but so over-used , it ' s ends up being intrusive rather than effective . o ' steen , who edited the earlier polanski masterpiece , shows no flair or subtlety whatsoever .  i enjoy science-fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that ? apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film , ' nana ( 1926 ) , ' this jean renoir short is a bewildering futuristic satire , produced on a budget that couldn ' t have been much more than zero . in the year 2028 , following a great war , africa has become the most civilised region on earth , and what was formerly europe has been designated " terres inconnues ( unknown land ) . " an african explorer Â played by johnny huggins , a black man dressed up as a white man dressed up as a black man , if you follow me Â travels to the ruins of paris in his spherical aircraft , and lands outside the lair of a parisian savage ( catherine hessling , then the director ' s wife ) and her primate companion , perhaps the creepiest ape-man costume i ' ve ever seen . the savage , as part of some bizarre sexual initiation ritual , starts showing the explorer the charleston dance , which he is delighted to learn himself . 

it doesn ' t help the film that hessling , who was wonderful the following year in renoir ' s ' the little match girl ( 1928 ) , ' isn ' t much of a dancer , though the extensive use of slow-motion adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony . furthermore , i ' m quite shocked that renoir would exploit his own wife as such a blatant sexual object Â it doesn ' t come as a surprise to learn of their divorce just three years later ! on the plus side , i did like the general sci-fi concept behind the film , and the slyly satiric touch of the reversing the racial roles usually typical in such stories as this . however , why renoir decided to dress up his black actor as a minstrel will remain a mystery for all of time . silly , crude and quite pointless , ' charleston parade ( 1927 ) ' is a cinematic oddity from one of cinema ' s most respected directors , and is perhaps an effort that he would have liked to forget . the dvd version came without a musical soundtrack , but i compromised with a selection of pieces from dmitri shostakovich .  i agree with most of the critics above . more yet , i was shocked by the presentation of the love scenes with the homosexual couple . why ? because while they --the director , the producers ? -- didn ' t have any compulsion whatsoever in presenting the different heterosexual couples in the most passionate embraces including nudity and super close-ups of french kissing and all sorts of nude contortions in bed , completely unnecessary in their length and in the story , when the moment came to show the same experiences with the homosexual couple , they only dare to go as far as an excruciatingly painful hug , almost among scholarly giggles , with two very nervous actors . so , in reality , the makers of this film found homosexuality to be unnatural , as one of the characters says in some scene . what a difference with the spanish cinema ! ! i remember being at the projection of an almodovar film in an italian cinema in rome , and being completely amazed at the total lack of reaction from the italian audience , they were afraid to have a reaction ! ! when in spain people would fall down from their seats laughing at all the risquÃ¨ situations and fabulous almodovar wit and flair . obviously in italy there are dark forces in its history that impedes the free manifestation of some very normal and natural emotions . pity . i must add that i was quite surprised to find that this same comment was censured by another correspondent . it ' s very bad and dangerous when we cannot be allowed by the narrowness of others to express our opinions about certain matters . where is freedom of speech ? i don ' t know if that censor will approve of the changes i was forced to make in this comment , and i hope he won ' t receive the same treatment from some other narrow minded judge . pity again .  this is by far the worst british comedy ever , how it made it past the first episode let alone the pilot is beyond me . the acting is weak from the main character played by ben miller to sarah alexander ( from the fantastic coupling ) right through the cast . the plot / story lines were unfunny and very very predictable using many worn out ideas . a very painful series to endure but sadly put in a slot between two excellent shows . describing it as britain ' s answer to ' meet the parents ' does a disservice to ' meet the parents ' and is as about as fresh as an old shoe that has a run around with the family dog . britain should have learned that rip offs from other countries never work from looking at america ' s sad attempts at doing so .  opulent sets and sumptuous costumes well photographed by theodor sparkuhl , and a good ( not great ) performance by jannings as henry cannot overcome poor writing and static camera-work . henny porten chews the scenery as anne . 

it ' s all very beautiful ; but it ' s all surface and no depth . the melodramatic tale of a woman wronged made it a hit in america where the expressionistic " the cabinet of dr . caligari " flopped in the same year ( 1920 ) , proving that what is popular is not what endures . lubitsch would be remembered for his lively comedies , not sterile spectacles like this .  having watched all of the star trek tv series episodes many times each since the 1960s , most being quite good to superb , and only very few being mediocre , my opinion is that this one is the worst of all . 

in fact , i think it ' s so poorly executed as to be an embarrassment to the series . it ' s not that the story is so bad , although it ' s not particularly outstanding in any way , but the acting is just abysmal on the part of the two lead characters , meaning those other than the regulars in this case . barbara anderson gives her weakest performance ever as the daughter of a mass killer , and who is on a mission of a sort . she practically calls in the role from a phone , and shows no real emotive abilities here . although usually she ' s never used as more than a pretty face in most of her film / tv roles , usually small parts , she has done much better . 

arnold moss as her father gives new meaning to the term ' ham ' and is the only actor ever on a 1960s star trek episode that outdid william shatner in this area , and actually makes shatner look superb by comparison . and he gets to play a shakespearian actor no less , which gives him more impetus to overact , and he does so . 

other than these two leads being so weak , the story is such that anybody with any sense at all can tell who the killer is within the first 15 minutes . i say this because i told my brother the whole plot ending at the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast as pre-teens . his reply was , yeah , you ' re right . 

skip this one and watch the much superior menagerie episodes which were originally televised right before .  despite decades of tax incentives , in terms of international visibility the canadian film industry still lags behind most central african and islamic states ( surprisingly few canadian films are released outside their native shores ) , and nouvelle-france aka battle of the brave is another example of why . more than any other country , commercial canadian cinema seems unable to develop an identity of its own and is stuck in pale imitation of other countries ' failures . on paper this historical drama could look vaguely promising . there ' s certainly a rich vein of untapped material in canada ' s history as the french and english warred over and bought and sold the colony , though none of it makes the cut here unless you count the odd blink-and-you ' ll-miss-it scene of characters saying " wolfe is dead " or " nouvelle-france is no more " before getting back to the soap operatics . but while this isn ' t a history lesson , it isn ' t a drama or the epic adventure the new title promises either : there is no battle in the film unless you count 10 seconds of shelling by a half-dozen re-enactors and one collapsed shed . the town square that is all we ever see of quebec is a rather obvious flatly lit studio interior , giving many scenes an old tv miniseries look , as does director jean beaudin ' s reluctance to offer much in the way of long shots or even exteriors . what you do get for your money is a simple but drawn-out harlequin romance about doomed lovers constantly separated by events beyond their control where the biggest surprise is that fabio doesn ' t turn up in the cast . it ' s the kind of film where whenever two characters are about to make the beast with two backs the camera pans over to a convenient raging fireplace or waterfall . 

an anglo-canadian-french co-production that doesn ' t so much unite once-warring nations as throw any country with a decent tax break into the stew , this massive box-office disaster was clearly intended to be canada ' s titanic - though someone neglected to tell the producers they meant the film , not the ship - but turns out more like revolution done on the cheap without the battle scenes , crowds or the few moments that threaten to briefly work in the face of overwhelming odds . the montreal mirror described it as " so bad that one can ' t even find the strength to mock it . " that ' s rather unfair , because while for most of its running time the film looks like a below-par 80s miniseries , the last half hour suddenly becomes very funny , with characters accidentally putting their legs in bear traps , dastardly husbands declaring " you ' ll never see your handsome lover again , cuckold ' s honor ! you ' ll pay for this , both of you ! " and our heroine accused of murder and - gasp ! - witchcraft in a trial funny enough to have been in demi moore ' s version of the scarlet letter . throw in caddish british governors , devious slaves and celine dion singing at the end and you ' ve got something that at times almost feels like the kind of film that timbo hines was aspiring to ( and still managed to miss wildly ) with his legendarily inept period version of war of the worlds , albeit without the staggering technical incompetence . 

leading man david la haye ' s versatility seems limited to the number of other actors he can look like throughout the course of the film : he starts out looking like andy garcia , briefly adopts the al pacino revolution look , flirts with the clean-shaven tchÃ©ky karyo style before turning into a younger ted danson as his character ages . while his opening scene where he reacts to news of his father ' s death with an expression that looks like he ' s waiting for the director to tell him he can go home now promises a feast of bad acting , in reality he gives the impression more of a mediocre supporting actor who ' s lucked into a lead at the last minute when whoever was originally cast finally read the script and bailed . he shows willing and gives it a go but the grace and charisma the part needs just isn ' t there . billie piper lookalike noemie godin-vigneau ' s leading lady doesn ' t exactly set the screen alight either despite occupying center-stage as the peasant girl who is the prey of giggly vincent perez ' s corrupt and perverted intendant le bigot ( that really is the character ' s name ) , the duplicitous goateed drunken lackey sebastien huberdeau and , saddest of all , gerard depardieu ' s bedridden revolutionary dirty old priest in a manky grey-haired wig . it ' s a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he shuffles through the motions looking like he ' s not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it . he clearly couldn ' t be bothered to stick around for the english dubbing sessions ( or even a couple of long shots where he is very noticeably doubled ) . small wonder he talked of retiring around the time of the film ' s brief release . 

some brief comic relief is provided by jason isaacs in his default patriot mode who overplays wolfe of quebec rather like an asthmatic alf garnett / archie bunker played by timothy dalton on speed while tim roth ' s william pitt stands on the sidelines with the occasional bemused smile of one who ' s being put up in a rather nice hotel with excellent room service and plenty of days off , though like colm meaney ' s benjamin franklin they ' re both in the film for less than three minutes . ( voltaire and madame pompadour pop their heads around the door for a couple of minutes as well but fail to make any impression , comic or otherwise . ) the supporting actresses are generally better : juliette gosselin and bianca gervais as the heroine ' s real and adopted daughters and a strikingly beautiful irene jacob looking for all the world like a young fanny ardant are all refreshingly good and deserve much better .  this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies in the history of cinema . the screenplay is really well done ( which is not often the case for this type of movies ) and you can see that chuck ( in one of his first role ) is a great actor . the final fight with the sherif deputy in the bullring is a masterpiece !  i had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing , but i just found it annoying . it ' s been a while since i ' ve seen it ( and hopefully i won ' t find out all my memories are wrong and i ' m unjustly condemning this movie ) , but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to portray leopold and loeb as victimized by an anti-gay society , and that this somehow caused their horrible crime . i totally disagree with this point of view , and think it ' s unfair both to homosexuals and to bobby franks , the real victim of the story . i can ' t imagine why anyone would want to claim those two as martyrs . i also thought l & l were portrayed as a bit more sophisticated than they actually were--after all , they were teenagers who lived at home . the film places them in a kind of fantasy world that seems like it should be scored by morrissey . 

i just read an interview with one of the filmmakers that implied the film ' s anachronisms , such as the push-button phones that characters used , were meant " to add brechtian distance " . they certainly do that , but i happened to find it highly irksome . 

apparently a number of people found this movie interesting , but i would have preferred a less " stylish " and more realistic examination of the part homosexuality may have played in the leopold & loeb case .  in terms of historical accuracy , this is the absolute worst roman film i have ever seen . the list not only of errors but of plot ideas that are flat impossible would run longer than the three-hour film , but just to give you an idea . . . 

julius caesar and augustus are presented as liberal democrats , taking the side of " the people " against " the nobles . " this is patently absurd . the caesars were as noble as you could get . their interest was in consolidating power and stabilizing a country that had been wrecked by 150 years of civil war . there had been reformers , notably the gracchi brothers , who lived about 100 years earlier , and to some extent advocated for the rights of ordinary citizens . 

there are several scenes that are utterly ridiculous , if you know anything about the period . " cleopatra " , with richard burton , will give you a much better idea of how events unfolded , fanciful though it is . 

historical accuracy is one thing . acting and dialogue are something else , and here this film veers perilously close to being a bad junior high school production . i burst out laughing several times , especially when julia , the daughter of augustus , meets a lover . they clutch passionately , as she breathes : " my father . . . " " ah , your father , your father . . . . your father would disapprove . " peter o ' toole is at his worst , forced to gnaw his way through some very pompous and silly lines . the actor who plays augustus as a young man is such a nebbish --- and the character is written as such --- it ' s impossible to envision him as the cunning , crafty , machiavellian politician who created the roman empire . here , he ' s just a whiner who has to be told what to do most of the time . 

charlotte rampling does manage to emerge from an underwritten role as livia , augustus ' s wife , with dignity . had she been given a fuller role to play , she might have rescued this production from absurdity . 

there is some nice photography and battle footage , helped by plenty of standard issue cgi . oddly , this was made for british tv ( and appears to be a british-italian co-production ) but is labeled with an " r " rating . 

the dvd picture is excellent and the dolby digital soundtrack is very nice , although you only notice it during the few action sequences , as the movie is mostly talk . 

almost any roman movie , even " cleopatra " or " the fall of the roman empire " , has more historicity --- to say nothing of compelling drama --- than this bizarre classics illustrated , jr . adaptation . this one gives new meaning to the much-abused phrase , " based on a true story . " in this case they could have said , " suggested by real events . "  jack higgins ' straightforward thriller about a guilt-ridden ira bomber forced into " one last job " ( where have i heard that plot before ? ) gets a snarky treatment from cult director mike hodges . mickey rourke , with alarming red hair , confesses all to the priest ( bob hoskins , of all people ) who accidentally witnessed the shooting . the rules of the church keep father bob from talking , but then rourke goes and falls in love with the priest ' s blind niece . they bond at the church organ . what ? really , that ' s the plot . alan bates is around as the top dog mobster who ' s calling the shots ( literally ) and he seems to be the only actor who ' s on to the jokey tone hodges is aiming at . bates is all set to do a sort of u . k . prizzi ' s honor , but no one else , including an effortlessly charismatic liam neeson in a supporting role , has been informed .  the incomparable paul naschy , horror film icon of spain , lends his talents to this entertaining if not scattershot film . what begins as an action flick ends up a horror story . all i can say is just sit back and enjoy the ride . 

paul naschy plays a cold-hearted hit-man hired by some shady japanese diamond hunters ( one of which is his flame who is carrying his child ) to swipe a cache of diamonds from a belgian businessman . when the deed is done , the allure of the diamonds is too tempting for paul to dismiss so he kills his japanese cohorts . his girlfriend , whose brother paul killed , vows revenge and chases paul through the forest , shooting him up and leaving him for dead . however , paul is found by an egghead with two horny daughters and brought to his estate to recuperate . 

at the estate , the two daughters , silvia aguilar and azucena hernandez , fight for paul in his weakened state , with the busty silvia aguilar determined not to lose out to the sweet and prim azucena . but things get hairy for mr . naschy who begins to see the ghost of the daughter ' s long dead mother on the estate grounds . couple this with the japanese lass looking to finish the job of killing paul and he gets pulled from two sides . 

story : $ $ ( the story goes a number of ways and doesn ' t fully satisfy . the script builds up a fight for paul between the daughters but silvia , whose character seems assertive and volatile , simply lets azucena win in the paul naschy sweepstakes without putting up a fight . personally , i would have preferred the ghostly apparition story to the revenge seeking of the japanese woman ) 

violence : $ $ $ ( you get gunplay , a blown-up babe and pigs eating some poor schmuck alive . gore hounds will not be letdown with this naschy flick ) . 

acting : $ $ $ ( paul naschy , as always , is fun to watch but he does spend a bit too much time in bed recovering from his wounds . starring with him again are the luscious silvia aguilar and the beautiful azucena hernandez , who teamed with mr . naschy in the little gem " the craving . " both girls do a fine job ) . 

nudity : $ $ $ ( you get very brief glimpses of both aguilar and hernandez but they are strategically placed , keeping the naught bits covered . full nudity is supplied by the two lesser appealing actresses : the japanese woman chasing paul and the african maid that works for silvia and azucena ) .  once again woody allen seems to be completely devoid of any inspiration other than recycling himself . here we have a mock documentary ( like zelig ) , the structure of the film is a series of anecdotes ( radio days , broadway danny rose ) set in the 30 ' s ( zelig , purple rose , bullets over broadway ) about a low-life ( deconstructing harry ) who believes being a genius absolves him from being a jerk ( ditto ) . given this film and deconstructing harry , one wonders if this is allen ' s justification for his own actions with mia farrow ' s adopted daughter ; yes , i was a jerk , but i ' m a genius so you gotta love me . 

 allen has only produced two good movies in the past ten years ; the fine but overpraised bullets over broadway , and the excellent but largely ignored manhattan murder mystery . his other efforts range from trifles ( new york stories , mighty aphrodite ) , to edgy yet experimental ( husbands and wives ) , to pure drek ( alice , scenes from a mall , shadows and fog , celebrity , deconstructing harry ) . his films no longer even try to have a narrative arc , and his humor seems to aim at wryly amusing , not funny . after deconstructing harry i stopped seeing his films in theaters ; after sweet and lowdown i may stop renting them as well .  as powerful as the true story of phoolan is , this book this film is based on came out before she herself was released from prison and had the chance to tell it . 

it is allegedly based on her diaries but she is illiterate . how does that work ? 

that said , some areas of he film are accurate and the acting isn ' t bad , with some sensitivity being shown . 

really though this story needs to be old in a tv series . far to much happens to cram into a couple of hours . 

read her autobiography . highly recommended . it is a fantastic story .  having watched this movie several times , i have come to the conclusion that milos forman made a very daring decision to manufacture a muse for goya , when the artist led what most would consider a tempestuous , passionate life while the french revolution and the napoleonic era raged across europe , surely one that would have sufficient drama upon which to draw . while i do understand that mr . forman was relating in the microcosm of the tragedy of ines ' life the devastation of the world at that time , i was left feeling that there was just so much of goya left out , so much of his humanity . the strongest and most eloquent point this film made was that because of man ' s fallen nature each of us is a potential villain in the stream of life , each of us has evil within us that we must fight with the help of god . how eloquent when goya says he should have helped ines more , how true for all of us ! we must defend and protect the innocent . the superbly ironic scene in which the once imprisoned priest sentenced to die pronounces the death sentence on lorenzo who condemned him originally is the stuff of genius . i was left wanting something more when the credits rolled . maybe less of the unreal coincidences , and more of the inner life of the characters .  tart is the worst movie i ' ve seen this year , and that includes both the affleck / j . lo bomb gigli and the rob zombie borefest house of 1000 corpses . i don ' t know if that ' s a fair comparison seeing that tart was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half that of even the low-budget 1000 corpses . regardless , all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings : horrible script , horrible acting , horrible direction . 

 * * * spoilers * * * ( although i honestly don ' t think there ' s anything to spoil ) 

tart is about a group of super-spoiled private school kids . most of them reside in super-sized apartments along new york ' s hyper-expensive park avenue , thanks to the finances of their neglectful parents . the film showcases the aimless life of one of the students ( cat ) as she discards her only true friend ( as frivolous a person as she was ) in the pursuit of the " good life " with the in-crowd . that , of course , leads to sex , drugs , and music that is substantially worse than rock & roll . everything is overly dramaticized in the way that truly bad movies usually are . cat ' s first sexual experience leads to her being branded a tramp and ostracized by her newly acquired circle of friends ; her first encounter with drugs leads to her nearly being dumped down a garbage chute after her cohorts believe her to be dead from an overdose . no heavy-handed messages there , he said sarcastically . 

that ' s mainly what the " seen it before 100 times " plot entails . other minor , and even less interesting , plot details include one friend who steals jewelry and trinkets from all the others , a wild child who lives life on the edge ( and finally falls off of it one night in the east hamptons ) , an anti-semitic british chick who ends her close friendship with cat the moment she finds out cat has a jewish father , and cat ' s strained relationship with her single mother who tries unsuccessfully to get cat to appreciate the privileged life she has . the thief turns out to be an irredeemable lowlife . the " wild child " is played as a toned down version of one of the hilton sisters . the british girl disappears from the film after the break-up . the mother / daughter relationship is seen as totally inconsequential until the film ' s final schmaltzy scene , where she and her beleaguered mother have a reconciliation of sorts . * yawn * 

 * * * end spoilers * * * 

about the cast and crew . . . . dominique swain came on the scene strong with her role as the underaged seductress in 1997 ' s highly watchable lolita and face / off . her performances were strong enough to land her on quite a few " ones-to-watch " lists at the time . she was 17 at the time and i hope that they will not be the best roles of her career . if she takes a few more roles like the one she takes in tart , it very well may be . 

i ' ve only seen bijou phillips in one other film ( bully ) and i swear her performance in that one was nearly identical to the one she gave here . i ' m not sure if she ' s incapable of giving varied performances or if it was just a coincidence her roles in the two were so very similar . my guess is that the former is true . i sense this woman possesses very little talent as far as acting is concerned . here , she is the actress tapped to portray the watered-down hilton sister . that she gives such a weak performance is amazing considering that she grew up with , and remains friends with , the real-life hilton sisters . she ' s essentially playing a version of herself in this film , and doing a damn poor job of it . 

as for writer / director christina wayne . . . i know nothing of her other than tart was her first , and only , film project to date . with a first effort like this it is no wonder her career in show business was short-lived .  the 33 percent of the nations nitwits that still support w . bush would do well to see this movie , which shows the aftermath of the french revolution and the terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post 9 / 11 socio-political landscape . maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and take the a * * -whupping they deserve . it ' s really a shame that when a politician ruins the country , those who voted for him can ' t be denied the right to ever vote again . they ' ve clearly shown they have no sense of character . 

what really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as robespierre ; a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology can ' t help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism . execution and murder . self-defense and patriotism . his legalistic litmus tests aggravate the hopeless situation he ' s helped create . sound like any belligerent , overprivileged , retarded yale cheerleaders you know of ? 

wojciech pszoniak blows the slovenly deparidieu off the screen . as sympathetic as robespierres plight is , it ' s comforting to know that shortly after the film ends he ' ll have his jaw shot off and be sent to the guillotine .  this movie is poorly written , hard-to-follow , and features bad performances and dialog from leads jason patric and jennifer jason leigh . the premise , believable but weak ( undercover narcotics agent succumbs to the drug underworld ) deserved better than this lili fini zanuck flop . the competent supporting cast ( sam elliott , william sadler , others ) was not enough to save this film . 

in addition , this movie also contains the absolute worst " love " scene in cinema . 

moreover , the soundtrack is vastly overrated ; specifically the revolting , sappy-without-substance " tears in heaven " by the otherwise legendary eric clapton . 

 " rush " is wholly unenjoyable from beginning to end . 

2 of 10 angel-a is a change of pace for besson ; monochrome , mawkish and rather mediocre . it is well photographed on location in paris , although subtitle-readers should note : quick-fire dialogue and good cinematography may make for frustrating viewing . 

this film is no " wings of desire " or " wonderful life " . despite its shared themes ( heavenly intervention averts suicide , angel / mortal relationships ensue ) , besson does nothing to enlighten or inspire us . even the well acted , teary moments , rapidly descend into toe-curling sentimentality . 

the film ' s flawed ideology irritates ; an angel whose message of love and respect for self is constantly undermined by her own violent and promiscuous behaviour ; a " happy ending " which negates the hero ' s supposed journey from helplessness to self-esteem and independence . 

verdict : quite nice to look at but confused moral and philosophical messages tarnish the film precisely where it should shine . 4 / 10 as a massive fan of dm , it goes without saying that i have seen this film numerous times . however , i watch it purely for the concert footage . . . the rest of the film is , um , pretty dreadful , sad to say . 

famed rock music film director da pennebaker followed mode around on their late 80s music for the masses tour , which promoted the superb album of the same name . the title 101 derives mostly from the fact that the concert material included is from the 101st and final concert of the tour at the pasadena bowl , but is also a reference to the movie being a ' beginners course ' on the band and how it ticks ie depeche mode 101 . amidst footage of the quartet playing live and exploring america is a second story thread covering a group of dm fans who ' ve won a competition to meet the band , go on the tour in their own coach bus and attend the finale gig . 

now , as i said above , the concert footage is great . mode are here on top of their form as stadium rock gods , which was a somewhat unusual achievement for an electrorock band back in the late 80s . though the film catches the band before they recorded their 1990 masterpiece " violator " , there are still countless excellent tracks seen and heard here eg behind the wheel , the majestic never let me down again , everything counts , just can ' t get enough from the vince clarke years , shake the disease and many more . 

when mode are onstage , they are brilliant . when they are not , they ' re , well , very boring . nothing even vaguely of interest happens to the lads as they check out the us in the dying days of the reagan administration . as an example , the probable " highlight " of the material is a visit to a country music store to buy cassettes . not exactly thrilling stuff . i know all bands don ' t have to be wild and reckless idiots , but these guys make the mormon tabernacle choir look like rammstein . 

the only real excitement comes from various clips centring on the band ' s lead singer dave gahan . gahan comes across in 101 as being mildly psychotic , talking about a violent power inside himself he can ' t control , recalling a bizarre rage attack involving a taxi driver and so on . there ' s one point in the film where he throws a prima donna tantrum at some poor guy backstage - truly embarrassing . the man clearly had issues back then , which thankfully have been resolved . songwriter martin gore and keyboardist andy fletcher are presented as very articulate , clearly massively talented , but also utterly colourless men ; while the somewhat enigmatic fourth member alan wilder is the only one of the quartet who pulls off the rock star persona with any sort of aplomb . 

and as for the ' fan tour ' thread , well it ' s unwatchable dross . let ' s not kid ourselves . maybe it ' s just because it ' s all so * very * late 80s , but the gaggle of young devotees do little for me but raise a feeling of irritation . they are , to a person , singularly shallow and vapid people , whose antics are banal when they aren ' t hide-your-face cringeworthy . let me reiterate . . . . * nothing * happens in the footage that isn ' t onstage that is of any interest . nothing . endless scenes of kids spraying their hair , arguing pointlessly , changing their clothes , getting lost in cities on the way to gigs and finding their partners in bed with another competition winner makes me wonder just one thing - if cure fans were this mind bendingly dull back in ' 88 / 89 . the love the youngsters have for the band is something i can definitely relate to , and is at times infectiously joyous , but if what we see was the most interesting stuff out of what was filmed of them , then i ' d hate to see the outtakes . 

but the music is all that matters , and in this regard 101 excels . the pasadena concert , one of their all time best gigs , makes the film worth seeing . the recent dvd edition of the movie comes with a bonus disc containing what remains of the unedited concert footage ( a good 80 % of the performance ) , and thus makes the dvd an absolute must for fans . the audio commentary by the band ( minus wilder , who left mode in the mid-90s ) on the first disc is also , oddly , far more interesting than the film itself . 

as a document of the boys from basildon during their amphitheatre idol period , depeche mode 101 is invaluable . but if you ' re looking for excitement , you ' re better off getting the accompanying double live album ( now available in super audio cd format ) .  i watched this film with a group of friends at the 1999 melbourne international film festival and no-one had a good word for it . 

i happen to love bluegrass and country music so it ' s not as if i ' m unsympathetic to the subject matter . but the problem is that at heart it ' s a very conservative movie- little more than a filmed mills and boon story . a bodice-ripper of the most simple-minded and soppy kind . 

it ' s not just that the love story at its heart , that between reece and dr . lily penleric is more than a tad unbelievable . ( why any male would be attracted to the nostril-flaring man-devouring lily is beyond me , and frankly , mike harding as reece seems to be just going through the motions ) . 

it ' s simply that the whole movie is too tame and well-mannered for its own good . there is precious little danger , dirt or drama . sure there ' s a moment of " excitement " involving a school run by lily ' s younger sister , but this whole episode is funnier than it is dramatic ( it ' s just so poorly written and acted ) . and the movie betrays its conservative agenda in the manner in which this subplot is resolved . 

as for good old reece kinkaid ( now , what ' s wrong with a name like eberneezer bumpass ? ) i ask you ! is the ending of this film believable ? fitting in with the character this film had earlier constructed ? i think not . . .  cimarron was painful to sit through . although irene dunn does a good job with the heavy-handed script , richard dix ' pompous and overacted role is brutal . the passage of time has not treated the character of isaiah , as well as other racial and religious notions , well , although the movie is somewhat progressive on the roles of women and the mistreatment of native americans . the editing is especially weak . this is , without a doubt , the worst of all the " best " pictures .  this cosy middle class sitcom became the subject of much hatred by the new breed of talented comedians in the 1980s , such as ben elton . did it deserve such malice ? well terry and june was never clever , it was never a well-written tale with different threads which intersect at the conclusion . it was the show your mother and father and probably grandparents watched . they chuckled rather than laughed , but they were never likely to be offended by the show , so the fact that it never challenged them was immaterial . 

one foot in the grave suffered initially because it appeared at first sight to be just another terry and june . 

a few days after the death of terry scott an episode was broadcast on terrestrial tv , and that has been its final outing . there have been few repeats of the show on any tv channel . 

thankfully tv comedy has advanced since terry and june . it ' s hard to find kind words for it - terry scott did make the best of weak scripts .  sit in your basement with the light out for an hour and a half . that ' s about the same as watching this subterranean search for the devil ' s door . an american researcher owen ( vincent gallo ) travels to moscow and gathers a rescue team to search for his friend sergei ( rade serbedzia ) , an archaeologist who has disappeared in the catacombs beneath russia ' s capital city . they will be shocked to discover subterranean dwellers thriving in the dank and dark complex system of caves and tunnels . the searchers will come upon the gatekeeper of hell , andrey ( val kilmer ) , and will strike a deal to continue their venture ; only to succeed in being scared almost witless when realizing they are among walking dead . also in the cast : joaquin de almedia , oksana akinshina , sage stallone , joss ackland and julio perillan .   " black dragons " is a second feature wwii propaganda film popular at the time . it ' s not as bad as some would have you believe . 

 a secret meeting hosted by the respected dr . william saunders ( george pembroke ) is interrupted by a mysterious stranger names monsieur colomb ( bela lugosi ) . shortly thereafter the participants at the meeting begin to turn up murdered , their bodies being placed on the steps of the japanese embassy in washington . colomb is suspected . federal agent dick martin ( clayton moore ) is assigned to the case and meets saunders niece alice saunders ( joan barclay ) who tries to assist him . the reasons behind colomb ' s actions are not explained until the final reel . until all is explained at the end , the story is hard to comprehend . 

 lugosi who had by this time been reduced to appearing in a string of low budget quickies , is actually quite good in this one . he is not allowed to over act as much as he ususlly did and credit for this has to go to director william nigh . lugosi ' s character slinks through the shadows and is reminiscent of his dracula even to the point of the full close ups of his piercing eyes . 

 clayton moore , a one dimensional actor at best , would become tv ' s lone ranger in a few years . joan barclay makes a good heroine . 

 although a little dated now , " black dragons " is not a bad way to spend an hour .  blind date ( columbia pictures , 1934 ) , was a decent film , but i have a few issues with this film . first of all , i don ' t fault the actors in this film at all , but more or less , i have a problem with the script . also , i understand that this film was made in the 1930 ' s and people were looking to escape reality , but the script made ann sothern ' s character look weak . she kept going back and forth between suitors and i felt as though she should have stayed with paul kelly ' s character in the end . he truly did care about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did by giving her up in the end to fickle neil hamilton who in my opinion was only out for a good time . paul kelly ' s character , although a workaholic was a man of integrity and truly loved kitty ( ann sothern ) as opposed to neil hamilton , while he did like her a lot , i didn ' t see the depth of love that he had for her character . the production values were great , but the script could have used a little work .   " julia kerbridge ( catherine mary stewart ) is working hard to become a doctor . suddenly , julia finds herself the guardian of her young niece , amanda , after her parents are found murdered . julia has a new neighbor , the mysterious kevin finney ( rob lowe ) . her hectic life comes crashing down when it becomes apparent that the young amanda holds the key to a terrible secret . for she too is now the target of the killers . julia must discover whether kevin is friend or foe , and unlock the sinister mystery before the murderer strikes again , " according to the dvd sleeve synopsis . 

this thriller quietly falls apart at the seams , but it is interesting some of the time . stalker sean devine ' s background telephone scene ( outside the police station ) and mr . lowe ' s violin ( restaurant ) are tensely played . but , early on , it ' s difficult not to miss the fact that one of the supposedly sophisticated killers purposely twists his foot in some red paint at the murder scene . unfortunately , this is not an intricate plot point ; and , there are worse story stumbles afoot . overall " dead silent " is not a bad way to spend some time , if there is nothing better on , or you ' re into lowe and his co-stars . 

 * * * * dead silent ( 1999 ) roger cardinal ~ catherine mary stewart , rob lowe , arlen aguayo-stewart , larry day i can ' t believe it ! were they crazy in filming a movie about connecticut in southern california ? for god ' s sake , there ' s palm tree ' s everywhere . in one of the opening scenes a guy says " welcome to connecticut " and throws down a newspaper , the newspaper says something like " greenwich herald " . greenwich connecticut doesn ' t have a " herald " it has a " times " as in " stamford advocate and the greenwich times . " ( refering to the stamford , connecticut newspaper ) . maybe the film makers should have done a little research , i mean my god , at least get the name of the newspaper right , or film in locations that look at least remotely like connecticut .  this is one of those road movies that would like to tell you a lotta things about women , the universe , the better life , the terrible solitude of the brilliant architect from manhattan who severs all links with everyone , including his three years old child -which may seem irresponsible to some-actually the hero wins hands down when it comes to selfishness and the scene with his old school pal , which begins as some kind of good old days conversation and ends on a threatening note is the oasis in a desert movie . 

the scene with-the-father-who-left-home-when -i-was-a child has been told and told and told . of course it did not prevent the offspring from making his way of life . and when you see the hero ' s wife ' s attitude , you may think she must never have heard about woman ' s lib . 

the best is the soundtrack which includes superb songs by willie nelson , tom waits or bonnie raitt . . . but you can enjoy them without this tedious pretentious work .  the casting ( and direction ) in undercurrent is more insipid than inspired in this noir clunker that fails from the outset to get off the ground . robert taylor ' s wooden style poses a roadblock almost immediately for the highly affected kate hepburn and it ' s bad chemistry from the outset . 

naive and innocent ann hamilton ( hepburn ) falls for handsome airplane manufacturer alan garroway ( taylor ) and rushes to the altar with him . she soon finds out there is a lot she does not know about him . as alan becomes more remote she delves further into the murky past and ann soon finds herself living a nightmare instead of the american dream . 

undercurrent resembles a few hitchcock plots but vincent minnelli rapidly establishes he is no master of suspense . hepburn is no shrinking violet and she is a hard sell for a character more suited to the reticent styles of teresa wright or joan fontaine . minnelli never really succeeds in getting kate to defer in desperate fashion to taylor ' s limited abilities as an actor . her attempts come across as silent gish while taylor ' s wide descent into madness takes on restrained bela lugosi . robert mitchum completes the miscasting as the sensitive brother . talk about piling on . 

cinematographer karl freund provides some highly stylized noir interiors but minnelli and cast utilize the atmospherics meekly and the tension remains tepid . with minnelli far from his forte ( musicals ) and hepburn ' s victim role fitting her like a bad suit undercurrent drowns all involved .  i can ' t understand why many seem to hate this . 

this movie ties together many of the overlapping settings of the historical and biblical epics of the fifties , using set pieces , props , and costumes similar to those seen in other movies . here , however , the story attempts to run through all of human history , with a frame story about the human race being on trial , with a guilty verdict meaning h-bombs will go off all over the world . the prosecutor is the devil , played with fiendish glee by vincent price . ok , so it ' s a little hokey calling the defender " the spirit of all men , " but i think that ' s one of the things that gives this movie a sense of period charm . the spririt of man is incidentally played quite well by ronald coleman , in his last film . it is also the last movie in which groucho , harpo , and chico marx all appear , but not together . groucho plays peiter minuet buying manhattan from the indians , in a scene played purely for campy humor . chico isn ' t funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat , and harpo , we are told , is meant to be isaac newton , discovering gravity . most of the other performances are well done , though . 

other hokey things are that the trial is supposedly taking place in outer space , which is depicted as a region of clouds and blueness . there is something called " the great clock of outer space , " which , when striking midnight , may signal the end of the world . 

but at its heart , the movie addresses the problems of wmds and the eternal question of whether man is basically good , or basically evil ; and poses it in what i think is an interesting way . also , anyone who likes the look of costume epics of the fifties should like the look of this movie .  i was looking for a documentary of the same journalistic quality as frontline or " fog of war " ( by errol morris ) . instead i was appalled by this shallow and naive account of a very complex and disturbing man and his regime : alberto fujimori . this movie should be called " the return of fujimori " . the director presumes she made a " perfect " movie because alienates both pro and anti-fujimori factions when in fact it is a very biased and unprofessional piece of work . 

the movie has few crucial facts wrong : 

1 ) she uses the so called " landslide " election of 1995 in which fujimori was re-elected with 65 % of the vote , as an example of the massive popular support of fujimori . but we all now know to be the fruit of a very organized electoral fraud . 

2 ) the movie states that sendero luminoso ( shining path ) killed 60 , 000 people . in fact , the truth commission ' s final report states that there were 69 , 280 deaths due to political violence in peru . 33 % of those were caused by sl . that leaves the other 67 % in the hands of the police , military and other groups . the fact that she uses the same misleading information that fujimori has been using for 10 years it is another example of how terrible this movie is . 

for any person with some education on peruvian politics and history , fujimori is clearly a consummated manipulator , a delusional character and remorseless egomaniac . his regime was very far from being democratic . he is still a menace to peruvians . despite these facts the director lets fujimori tell the story . not only on how he wants the camera to be positioned but the narrative and direction of the film seem to be part of his political agenda . he always seems to have the last word . there are no journalistic " cojones " , just soft questions and unchallenged remarks . where is oriana fallaci when we need her ? the director , when questioned after the screening , didn ' t hide the fact that she was deeply impressed by fujimori , his charm and intelligence . yes , she has been definitely charmed by him , and you can tell by looking at this film . it ' s obvious she has a very hard time to digest the multitude of facts that point towards his responsibility on the corruption , murder and deception that took place . she assured the gasping audience that fujimori was really a " patriot " when few moments earlier , one of the leading peruvian journalists was very adamant in telling us that fujimori was , above all , a " traitor " . she went on to say that despite all the accusations not " a single dollar " was found on any bank account on his name , etc , etc . it was like hearing again the same gang of ruthless thugs that ruled the country for 10 years defending their master . it was a sad moment for journalism . 

this film makes injustice to history . it is an insult to hundreds of dead people , disappeared or unjustly incarcerated by fujimori ' s regime . no wonder she later confessed that all the peruvian intellectuals she befriended while making the movie felt betrayed by it . unbiased ? the words " oportunistic " , " naÃ¯ve " and " denial " come to my mind instead .  i loved this movie when it first came out ( but i was just 12 years old then - and i had forgotten this film existed until one day i found a used copy for sale at a gas station . i bought it and i couldn ' t wait to watch this film that had i loved as a kid , and then as i saw this film again many years later , it hit me . . . . why in the world did i like this film as a kid , watching it again as an adult i realized that this film is terrible . the saddest part about this film is that they had everything in place to make the greatest western ever and they blew it ! ! ! the costumes are perfect , good actors , there are 2 music scores the orchestrail score is wonderful , and keeps with the classic spirit of the old timey lone ranger alive , the second score is a series of songs by country music artest like merle haggerd , and the statler brothers and those songs like " the man in the mask " are so bad that they are funny . this movies strongest point is that it had a briliant storyline , and one of the best western plots ever , and for a while its fun to watch as john reid is nursed back to health , after he and his fellow rangers are ambushed . its fun to see him grow into his new life and identity as the lone ranger , as he concels his identity , and goes on a revenge run to get the gang responsible for killing his brother and all his fellow rangers to whom he rode with . but unfortunatly , as good as the storyline is , its all ruined by merle haggard narrating everything as you are watching it happen ( for the love of god why did they do that ? ) between merle haggard ' s narration and the statler brothers singing corny ( stupid ) songs like " ride little cowboy " being playing in the backgound make this movie impossible to take serious . i would love to see a really good producer take this same script and story and re-do this film right , because at the heart of this silly film is a great western . ---i would descibe this film as a beautiful woman dress in the ugliest clothing . i give it 4 stars out of 10 --if your 12 years old , and dont know better , then you might love it .   " kicked in the head " is all about the corrigan character , a twenty something man on a quest to find himself , and his involvements with a handful of quirky characters . this thin and ambiguous story , which was written by corrigan , has a make-it-up-as-you-go feel and a screenplay which smells like an uninspired low budget indie . in spite of that and some annoying hindenburg scene interjections , the film has an off beat , quirky kind of charm which may appeal , in some small way , to people with a similar sense of humor . not for everyone , not for most , but maybe fun for some . ( d+ )  i enjoyed carax ' s " les amants du pont neuf " and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard . well , the first 10 minutes were ok , but then it disintegrates into a rather pretentious journey of a young man looking for the essence of life . a sad disappointment .  definitely not a good film but nowhere as bad as some would paint it to be . nightmare in wax tells the story of a man , having had his face disfigured in a typical flashback scene , wreak his vengeance on those directly responsible and those indirectly for the losses in his life - most notably the love and companionship of a beautiful young actress . cameron mitchell plays the artist with his typical flair , albeit limited flair . actually , i thought he gave one of his better performances . what exactly does that mean ? mitchell wears an eye patch , endlessly smokes cigarettes , wears a motley tunic , and talks to his creations in wax . they are not your ordinary wax dummies , but rather people still alive controlled by some serum that makes them lose control of all neurological function . they become zombies in effect . i thought the premise here was inventive if nothing else . it has some ludicrous explanation , but does serve the plot . this is a film of the 60s to be sure with some psychedelic camera-work by bud townsend and company . the acting is mediocre but mitchell , scott brady , and barry kroeger give interesting turns . the wax figures of hollywood ' s bygone era are done very effectively and most of the location shooting was very credible . the end of the film dissipates into something not quite real - either another example of 60s cultural cinema or the end of the scriptwriter ' s creativity . i ' m banking on the latter . despite its many flaws , i enjoyed the film . the opening scene showing an actor being needled was effectively done as was a police chase on the waterfront .  young spinster , who doesn ' t associate with women her own age and is eyed by gentleman from the retirement set , invites an apparently mute young man into her apartment on a rainy day . nervous and overly-polite to hide her own sexual insecurities , she is most pleased when the boy makes himself to home in her guest bedroom . . . but not so happy when he begins sneaking out the window at night . sandy dennis is not a hapless actress , but why she was attracted to these sad-sack roles i guess we ' ll never know . based on a book by richard miles , and about as far removed from a commercial drama as one could get , this lurid material not only attracted dennis but also director robert altman ( whose work is static , at best ) . the narrative seems almost a sex-reversal of " the collector " , a tag which may have sold the film-rights but which doesn ' t turn out to be a good idea cinematically . even the film ' s best sequence ( dennis shopping for a prostitute to satisfy her prisoner ) doesn ' t quite come off , with sandy acting both ill and indignant ( whose idea was this plan ? ) . michael burns is quite good as the kid who uses this frumpy , pasty-sick woman just for her comfy digs , but he ' s handled too bashfully by altman , with lots of strategically-placed towels and flesh-colored undies ( altman clearly wasn ' t ready for a mature picture with adult themes at this point ) . sandy dennis has a handful of very good scenes ; she doesn ' t chatter away mindlessly here , she thinks before she speaks and she ' s alarmingly careful in her actions . unfortunately , the role itself is a bummer , with an apparent slide into mental deterioration which seems to happen off-screen . as such , the abrupt finale is maddening , and the overall results tepid . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  a wonderful semi-humorous homage to expressionistic black and white films of folks like fw murnau , fritz lang , carl dreyer , marcel carnÃ© and others . allen plays a character caught in a kafkaesque nightmare , at first thinking he is part of a vigilante group trying to catch a killer and slowly realizing that he might be a suspect . the writing is a little forced ( this is , after all , woody allen trying to be a coy kafka ) , but the point is made , and no harm done . the cinematography is interesting , about 100 shades of gray , but make sure you watch in a very dark room with a good screen , or details will get swallowed in the fog . this is an amusing little movie with a few laughs that are actually snorts of " uh-huh " . the acting is fine , considering the odd vehicle , and it ' s worth watching if you are big woody allen fan . also of interest to those knowledgeable about expressionistic films . i ' d give this a 6 . 5 out of 10 .  this is supposedly a story in which a grown man tells a story about his youth . yet , you see things like personal computers , e-mails , faxes , etc , which are items used in the late 20th century and early 21st . 

so when is this guy supposed to be telling this story - in 2020 . gee , i wonder how advanced we are then . how about telling us that . 

also , there are several legal issues which also make no sense . in the courtroom scene , the story falls into the usual pratfalls of surprise evidence , which is inadmissible in any real court of law in this country . also , grandma would have to be missing at least seven years in most states before to be declared officially dead . 

congratulations elmo shropshire . you are now officially a sellout .  special sneak previews are always a good time . no matter what movie it is you are seeing , the theatre will always be packed by people who have been awaiting the film , like free stuff , thought it ' d be something to do , or just got lost . either way , no matter how good or bad the film , the audience alone will make it enjoyable . now when said movie is a pg-13 pseudo- horror film ( can you really delve into horror when the mpaa is on your back censoring everything ? ) you know there will be chatter , laughing , and breath holding . with the messengers , the crowd did not disappoint giving numerous outbursts and warnings to the characters on screen . as for the actual movie , i feel sorry for those involved because it really could have been much better had it been paced right and allowed to stretch its legs beyond the scare / fade-to-black / show aftermath progression these films have . in the end we are shown a boring , plodding story with no surprises and few moments of actual suspense . 

the story is a common one . a family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try and rebuild their relationship with each other . once settled in , the spirits of the house come out to the reformed troublemaker child whose past makes it even easier for the parents to disbelieve everything told to them . of course the child is not crying wolf and those around only find out when it is too late . i will credit the pang brothers , ( directors of the acclaimed the eye that i would like to watch more than before to see what they can do without hollywood interferenceÂsupposedly reshoots on the messengers were done by someone else , but the brothers retained credit ; it ' s a shame what our studio system does to foreigners especially when it was creative independence which made the films that brings them in and not bottomline interference ) , for really having a fitting style and for keeping the tired plot line somewhat fresh . unfortunately , though , i also must give them credit for the almost unbearable slowness . similar to why i disliked what lies beneath , i couldn ' t stand the drawn out suspense , which goes so far as to make it laughable . when our heroine and her brother stand in a hallway with a ghost behind them , the scene lasts about eight minutes with just static , oddly composed close-ups and depth of field focus changes to end up culminating to absolutely nothing . for being only 84 minutes , i almost think it would have worked better even shorter . 

besides a very effective opening sequence , featuring the fantastic jodelle ferland , ( strangely playing a boy ) , and a great atmospheric credit sequence , the only thing that saves the film from utter garbage is the acting . except for penelope ann miller , who first made me wonder what ever happened to her and then , after a few scenes , made me understand why i never asked that question in the years she was absent , and dustin milligan , completely lacking in credibility , the acting is very strong . dyan mcdermott does a nice job as the father trying to keep his family together through all the tough times . he has many little moments of light comedy to counteract his serious , dramatic role . william b . davis ( everyone ' s favorite cancerman ) is used effectively as an almost foreboding character , sadly not utilized more . our true stars are kristen stewart and john corbett . stewart plays the emotion very well and shows some promise as an actress with this and panic room on her resume . as for corbett , if he didn ' t pull off his role , the entire movie would have unraveled completely . i do wish he would be given more work as i ' ve enjoyed him since the under-appreciated series " the visitor " Âi still need to check out his first role in " northern exposure , " a show i haven ' t yet been able to catch up on . it ' s a shame he will probably be most recognizable for the overrated my big fat greek wedding . 

if anything , the messengers gave me a nice introduction to the pang brothers ' work and reinvigorated my desire to check out their chinese horror catalog . the mood and performances were there ; it was just the simple and vacant story that needed way too much padding to make a feature film . if they delved more into other characters , rather than just stewart ' s , it could have been more effective while also having something more to show then ten minute scenes of nothing . if our protagonist is the only one being attacked , there is no suspense as to how far the creatures will go to harm her . the moments of danger had no gravity to them and until the ending really just stood in as filler . i am excited , however , for the free comic book given away after the special screening , as hopefully the medium will allow for a faster paced story that engrosses before it tries to surprise .  this world war ii film , set in borneo , tries so hard to work on so many levels , it is a shame it fails on all of them . 

nick nolte is an escaping american who witnesses the executions of his comrades by the japanese . he wanders deep into the jungles of borneo , lost . cue nigel havers , who finds nolte ' s adopted tribe . nolte , now looking like robert plant , has become his tribe ' s new king . he defeated a staunch warrior in a bloody battle , and had a telling tattoo on his chest ( a dragon ) . now before you go out and get a painful tattoo and a one-way ticket to borneo , things are not going well in nolteland . havers wants the tribe ' s help in fighting the japanese , who are invading the island . he teaches the natives how to use machine guns , and a whole lot o shooting begins . as the tribe becomes more successful , they run up against a new squadron of japanese who are not like the others . this squad cannibalizes the villages they conquer in order to keep their strength up ( talk about your sushi ) , and they move through the jungles even quicker than the tribe . since we know the outcome of the war , we know eventually the tribe triumphs , but with heavy casualties . here come the spoilers : havers is injured and returned to " civilization . " he gives the location of the kingdom and nolte is captured . havers then goes through the trouble of releasing nolte , and the end credits roll . 

milius ' direction is certainly adequate , but the screenplay here is rather vague in its motivations . it presents story ideas , then abandons them in order to get to the next story idea . nolte is awful as the soldier turned king , desperately trying to channel the spirit of marlon brando ' s colonel kurtz . he talks about freedom , and the beauty of the jungle , and the richness of his people , and you will not believe for one second the words he utters . he is often unintentionally funny , especially his initial bug out in the jungle , and he spends the rest of the film sounding like a hippie . nigel havers spends the movie looking at nolte like he was raquel welch . the vague homosexual undercurrent between the two goes beyond friendship , not quite to sex , and settles into an unspoken relationship that must have had the natives talking . 

havers often stands around and has an internal conflict , repulsed at the tribe ' s headhunting , but basking in nolte ' s attention . his fellow straight laced british servicemen go native faster than the bounty landing party in tahiti , but all i saw concerning borneo is that it is very humid and has lots of green . 

the climactic betrayal , where havers gives away nolte ' s location , is completely devoid of any reason . there is not one thought given as to why havers does this , except to keep the film going . i was angry , when by chance , havers and nolte end up on the same ship going to the philippines , the ship happens to run aground , and havers runs to the hold to free the freshly shorn nolte . no goodbye kiss , but havers says farewell to the king , explaining the title . 

if you were fighting a war , and an enemy squadron was eating your allies , would that not freak you out ? this elite japanese squad is not shown enough , although their eating habits are so horrific i would become a conscientious objector right away . the same type of ghostly enemy was handled much better in " the 13th warrior . " 

other types of interesting ideas are dropped . what about the fact that then modern technology brings about the deaths of so many backward people ? why did king nolte let the brits use his subjects without too much hesitation ? why can ' t hollywood find a decent actor to play general douglas macarthur ? 

in the end , " farewell to the king " is a letdown , not anchored by a strong lead , and trying to be too many things without thinking and exploring its options . i cannot recommend this one . 

this film is rated ( pg13 ) for strong physical violence , strong gun violence , some gore , some profanity , some sexual references , and adult situations .  in reality that happened : the royal mother in law and father in law lunched with the couple the day after the wedding and gave her the money in public . this troubled young elisabeth so much that she never forgot the issue . we must remember she was only 16 . she was so embarrassed that she kept a fear for sex all her life . perhaps this began to appear as a trauma . also the constant meddling of her aunt and mother in law . as you say , she kept all her children away from her , critiqued her teeth and manners ( which she considered inappropriate for an empress ) , and when sissi finally went to venice with her husband and children , her eldest daughter died , and the mother in law blamed her for that unfortunate and premature death . she never recovered .   " atoll k " aka " utopia " is one of hollywood ' s saddest swan songs . filmed in france , " the land that loves lewis ( jerry ) " in 1950 and released the following year after a five-year layoff , the boys are in truly terrible shape physically . however , they aren ' t in nearly as bad a shape as the script . 

this movie is one of the un-funniest " comedies " ever filmed . 

it ' s painful to see this legendary team , the funniest duo in the history of motion pictures , the twosome that made " the devil ' s brother " ( 1933 ) , " the music box , " ( 1932 ) , " pack up your troubles " ( also 1932 ) , " babes in toyland " ( 1934 ) , " bonnie scotland " ( 1935 ) , " flying deuces " ( 1939 ) and so many more gut-wrenching , laugh-til-you-choke classic comedies , in a film such as this . 

but fighters and ballplayers do it all the time . they stay in the game one season or one fight too many . in this case , while is morbidly fascinating to see laurel & hardy at this late stage in their legendary careers , they , too , stuck around for one too many .  this is a slick little movie well worth your time to find and see . 

it really speaks to all those mundane choices we all make every day and ( like an h . g . welles story i can ' t quite recall ) may live to want back . 

keep in mind that this is a short ( very short ) . it starts out slowly but just as you begin to think it has become boring =bang= it ' s over . and , believe me , the ' punch line ' is one you will remember . 

i ' m not sure if the producers are going to make it available for purchase - or available on the web but either way you ' d be happy you took the time to get hold of a copy - of that i am sure .  at least if you ' re a disney fanatic ( well , of the variety who loves their live-action films as well as the animated stuff ) , if you ' re a kid , if you ' re a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize you ' re an adult , if you love absolutely any film that features animals , especially when they ' re doing tricks , or if you ' re just not too demanding , air bud : world pup is somewhat enjoyable to watch . i ' m a disney fanatic . i enjoyed this film enough , and i ' ll gladly watch it again . 

but boy does it have a lot of problems . the main flaw arises from a combination of too many characters , too many plot threads and not enough time to take care of them all . in the space of 82 minutes , we ' ve got adults getting married , teens falling in love and trying not to be awkward at it , teen competition for love and jealousy , preteens playing spy games , dogs falling in love , dogs playing soccer , dogs having puppies , manipulative parents who ' ll do anything to make their kids win being taught a lesson by their kids , housekeeper dilemmas , and crooks cooking up and executing elaborate plots . i ' m probably forgetting something , but that ' s 10 big plot issues to be dealt with , with less than 10 minutes per thread to deal with them , and presumably weave them into a coherent whole that ' s both not too complicated--this is a kids ' film , after all--and that ' s also humorous and heartwarming . not surprisingly , director bill bannerman , on his first turn being completely in charge ( he has a lot of previous second unit experience ) , wasn ' t quite up to the task . i ' m sure it didn ' t help that there were at least three screenwriters involved , and probably dictating producers , as well . 

the end result is that air bud : world pup is extremely choppy . events occur with little justification , and worse , often little explanation . people figure out and do things primarily because they need to--and fast--so that everything can arrive where it needs to arrive in less than 90 minutes . from one cut to the next , time might jump ahead six months or so . we have both adults who seem like maybe they ' re mentally disabled and kids who just intuitively figure out what a dog is thinking and rush into some unexpected action . some of the threads should have simply been removed , because it ' s difficult to become too engaged in the film when as soon as you ' re introduced to an idea , it ' s already passed you by . 

also not helping is the fact that one of the threads is basically a rip-off of one hundred and one dalmatians ( 1961 ) , minus a cruella de vil character . and another problem is that given the way the film is edited , i have to assume that the dog , air bud , probably couldn ' t do much with the soccer ball . unlike the first two films , a dog playing a sport is almost an afterthought here , and when we see him , it ' s in very quick glimpses ; every once in a while , these snippets appear to be even aided by computer animation . 

yet , for someone like me , there ' s a cheesy charm to air bud : world pup . the script and performances often teeter between ridiculous , hokey and kinda clichÃ©d . i tend to like that combination . it makes the film both a bit predictable and subtly bizarre . and at times , like the ending , when the film completely abandons consistency and basically becomes a commercial for the u . s . women ' s soccer team , air bud : world pup is so blatantly tacky that you can ' t help but love it .  i feel terribly sorry ! where the lubitsch-pic was enchanting , marvelous , full of spirit and elegance , this one here is only - colored ! lana looks like 51 ( in fact she was 31 at that time , but obviously depressive ) and tries to play a shy and dull girlie . think of jeanette mcdonald , who gave the role of the widow a double-faced depth by " playing " with count danilo . that lana had to play an operetta although unable to sing - crazy ! she only sings one song - the title role of an lehar-operetta , that is really funny ! the only really good thing is the great waltz scene at the end : glamorous ! and - after watching this scene - have a look at the introducing waltz scene in " gentlemen prefer blondes " ! any similarities ?   . . . but not this one ! i always wanted to know " what happened " next . we will never know for sure what happened because gwtw was margaret ' s baby . i am a lifelong fan of gone with the wind and i could not have been more repulsed by the movie . i did compare " scarlett " to the original gwtw because any film worth following gwtw needed to be on the same quality level as the first . rhett was cast beautifully , although no one will ever compare to mr . gable . i am also a strict vivien leigh fan ! ! she was scarlett . she fit the bill . not another actress in this lifetime or another will ever fit the same shoes but with " scarlett " the job could have been done better . not enough thought went into finding the proper scarlett , that was evident . 

overall , something to look to but if you want to know the what happened to scarlett and rhett , i suggest writing it yourself or finding fan fiction . this movie is not worth the time .  miles o ' keefe stars as ator , a loin-clothed hero who resembles a chippendale ' s dancer . the conan-wannabe must do battle with an evil guy in a cher wig , and protect the earth from the geometric nucleus , a sort of primitive atomic bomb . watch closely for visible sunglasses and tire-tracks . mystery science theater 3000 made fun of it under the title cave dwellers .  the plot for black mama white mama , revolves around two female inmates , at a women ' s prison in the phillipines . one black , and one white . these two women , are thrown together in the prison . pam grier is lee daniels lee is incarcerated in the hellish women ' s prison , for dancing as a harem girl . 

lee ' s boyfriend owes her part of his profits , from his drug-dealing activities . lee is mainly interested in breaking out of the prison to get hold of her beau ' s drug money , so that she can leave the phillipines and assume a better life . margaret markov plays karen brent , a white women from a privileged background , who is also a revolutionary . karen has joined a group of revolutionaries , determined to change the corrupt phillipino political system . she ' s captured by phillipino authorities , and held as a political prisoner . 

the story-line takes-off , when karen and lee break out of the prison they were in together . the two of them also happened to be chained together at the wrist . as they flee , they also fight with each other , because they have different goals to pursue . naturally , they hate being chained together . but they also realize that they must put aside their differences , to help each other survive while they evade capture . 

if this film seems very similar to the big bird cage , it ' s because much of the cast in the two films is the same , as well as their location in the phillipines . roger corman , has always had a consistent stable of actors , that he used in all of his 70s b movies . besides pam grier , sid haig , roberta collins , claudia jennings , betty anne rees , and william smith , were also among the many actors that were frequently cast , in corman ' s aip films . 

like the big bird cage , black mama white mama , relies on too much gory violence to be palatable . pam grier conveys her usual tough chick persona in this film , and shows her competence as a female action heroine . margaret markov is less effect , in her portrayal of the revolutionary karen . she just seems to fragile and well-coiffed , to be a dedicated political guerrilla . except for sid haig , as the colorful ruben , the rest of the cast is forgettable . 

this film has little entertainment value , unless excessive , heinous acts of violence are your thing . only the performances by pam grier and sig haig , make this film worth watching .  half a mystical thriller and half the fractured fantasies of a fragile mind , " guardian of the frontier " is an engaging trip that soon derails . strong imagery and a compelling premise is soon overwhelmed by incoherent plotting , hackneyed dialogue , amateurish acting , and the most outlandish and over-the-top phallic imagery in recent memory ( here , a fish is most definitely not just a fish ! ) . evidently , this is the first slovenian feature film to be directed by a woman -- ms . weiss must have been determined to prove that she could be as lurid and gratuitously explicit as any man .  i loved the first " american graffiti " with all my heart and soul that i considered it to be the best movie about rock n ' roll along with being the best teenager flick i ' ve ever seen . the first film spawned the careers of george lucas who would later do the blockbuster epic " star wars " before doing the prequels two decades later while making richard dreyfuss a star in jaws , close encounters of the third kind and other films as well . 

somehow without those two , the magic died off . 

 " more american graffiti " shows audiences what happened to the rest of the characters later on in the sixties where steve ( ron howard ) and laurie ( cindy williams ) are protesting against the vietnam war while their friend terry " the toad " fields ( charles martin smith ) is in the war himself and trying to get out . john milner ( paul le mat ) is still the hot drag racer in california where he never quite left home . the rest of the supporting actors in the film from candy clark ' s debbie ( terry ' s girlfriend ) , to the pharaoh ' s gang members , along with harrison ford and others really don ' t do much . the original film showed teenagers cruising the streets without any bloodshed with the early music of rock n ' roll from buddy holly , the fleetwoods , chuck berry , fats domino , bill haley and the comets , buddy knox and more that brought back the nostalgia bug in classic music . the soundtrack for " more american graffiti " is a mixture of rock , soul , country , hippie music , and whatever fitted the mood during the late 60 ' s of protesting , drugs , sacrifices and more . 

after watching " more american graffiti " it looked like it wanted to show audience members what happened after the title epilogue of the four main characters in the first film ( with the exception of dreyfuss ' s character ) where it wasn ' t necessary . this film wasn ' t necessary either as i was glad to see that neither lucas or dreyfuss moved on to bigger and better projects .  i was disappointed in this documentary . i thought it would be about the second chess match between grandmaster garry kasporov and deep blue the supercomputer designed by ibm computer experts to beat any human chess player . kasparov was and still is , considered the greatest chess player ever . the movie takes us back to 1997 where kasporov had agreed to have a rematch with " deep blue " after defeating it 1 year earlier . but instead of focusing on the game , it focuses more on what happens before and after . there are snippets of the game , but not very many . much of the film centers around kasporov ' s paranoid obsession that the match was rigged as part of some conspiracy theory and that he lost the match unfairly . the movie also includes interviews with people who are not interesting in any way . they even chat with the manager of the building where the match took place . who cares ? i also found it very dry and slow . ultimately this movie was unsatisfying . this is just my opinion , of course . if you like conspiracy theories , this movie might interest you . for people not into chess or conspiracy theories , this movie would probably have no value . i am a chess fan , and i only stuck it out because of that . i give " game over : kasparov and the machine " 4 / 10 let me first just say that in the past , i have been a huge carlin fan . i think george is one of the smartest people and best comedians on the planet . what made george so great in the past was his ability to look at things in his own twisted way , and give us his unique perspective on those things . it wasn ' t always meant to be funny , but you always respected his opinions , because they were presented in such a clever way . but you are all diseased is just a long rant . he doesn ' t give us any unique perspective on anything , he just gives us a long list of stuff that he ' s p . o . ' d at . there is no insight , no cleverness , just an old man complaining for one hour straight about things that we have all complained about . and on top of that , it wasn ' t even funny . you are all diseased appeals to dumb people who can ' t handle anything more advanced than something simple and direct . i don ' t mind anger fueled comedy , but george could have done so much better . i really hope that george carlin ' s next show will live up to the quality that george has shown in the past .  it opens - and for half an hour , runs - like an educational programme on the old testament , although not without humour . the movie finally begins to grow wings when the biblical cant gets dropped . in a scene of mixed success martin donovan ( jesus ) decides to renege on kicking off the apocalypse and the final quarter of an hour is a sort of humanist ' what ' s all the fuss about ? ' play-out , gilded with optimistic conjecture against a ( retrospectively , miserably ironic ) long shot of the wtc twin towers . 

apart from donovan ' s authority , the acting is split . there ' s the thespian melodrama of the rest of the cast : this , though formally contrived for biblical presentation , is appropriate for the modern , paranoid comedy that hartley ' s aiming at . but i was also pleasantly surprised at the contribution of pj harvey ( credited thus , and in danger of existing within the film solely as the pop star entity she is , not least in a set piece scene in a record store and a perilously patchy soundtrack to which contributes ) . she remained cool - a sort of disingenuous lack of focus - in the manner of many pop icons who have taken to film ( i ' m thinking the jagger of performance here ) but nonetheless maintained a convincing integration with both cast and project . 

ultimately affirmative , but this bittersweet essay is a bit too much like one and relies more on the perseverance than the imagination of its audience . 4 / 10 mgm tried pairing up and coming young men with the divine one to give them exposure and try them out as leading men . gable and garbo had chemistry in susan lenox but it was a lousy film . here in inspiration there is no chemistry whatsoever between garbo and robert montgomery and the script is poor as well . what were they thinking ? the modern , fast-talking , wise-crack-snapping montgomery and the long-suffering garbo ? it is a tale like camille . young student falls for woman of the world and is repelled by learning of her past , rejects her , takes her back , rejects her . . . . you get the picture . garbo is completely believable as a top parisian artist ' s model and completely at home , although bored , with her life at the top of society amidst her artistic friends and their loose morals . suddenly she is fascinated by this innocent . she finally gives up her life for him and sinks into poverty , only to be rescued by him and set up in a house of her own . ironically , he intends to marry and keep her on the side - so much for his pure moral ethic of earlier . 

the scenes are incredibly dull and boring and nothing much happens . only marjorie rambeau as lulu is able to inject life into the proceedings with such lines as " unfortunately weak women have strong appetites " and " odette , where is thy sting ? " 

only for garbo fans .  edge vs . michaels-boring in general ( loved the sweet chin music into the chair ) 4 / 10 taker vs . heidenreich-one of the worst matches i ' ve seen , predictable as hell 1 / 10 tripe threat wwe match-why do i watch them , nobody ever wins a championship at the rumble , its not the main event . liked it when show drove jbl through the wall . 3 / 10 world heavyweight championship-pretty ok match , kind of more a beat-down by tripe h than a match , but i was happy to see it after watching crap . 5 / 10 royal rumble-good rumble , liked the brand showdown , the hassan thing , and the end . 7 / 10 overall still crap . why does anyone watch the rumble ? ? ?  corridors of blood

 ( black and white ) 

london , 1840 : whilst attempting to formulate an anaesthetic solution , a dedicated surgeon ( boris karloff ) becomes addicted to narcotics and is blackmailed by local bodysnatchers . 

riding the coat-tails of a gothic revival occasioned by the recent success of hammer ' s the curse of frankenstein ( 1957 ) , robert day ' s corridors of blood is an odd mixture of historical drama and grand guignol theatrics . producer richard gordon lured karloff away from hollywood - where his movie career had become stalled in a b-movie rut ( voodoo island , frankenstein 1970 , etc . ) - for a couple of lurid shockers in which good men are thwarted by circumstances beyond their control . in grip of the strangler ( 1958 ) , he played a novelist who stumbles onto a horrific secret whilst researching a series of murders from recent history , while in corridors of blood , he ' s a drug-addicted surgeon who falls prey to a gang of criminals masterminded by east end pub landlord francis de wolff . less a horror film than a melodrama with ghoulish trimmings , the movie hedges its commercial bets by including a number of gory thrills ( a leg sliced open , a face destroyed by acid , etc . ) , but the narrative is motivated chiefly by karloff ' s altruistic pursuit of an anaesthetic formula that will alleviate the terrible suffering of patients during surgery . 

produced under the title ' the doctor from seven dials ' , the finished movie went unreleased until 1962 due to indifference by distributors mgm , by which time co-star christopher lee had earned a prominent screen credit , despite playing a small - but significant - role as ' resurrection joe ' , a sinister cockney thug who murders carefully selected patrons of de wolff ' s squalid pub and sells the remains to local doctors . lee filmed this glorified cameo before the curse of frankenstein catapulted him to international stardom , which accounts for his limited screen time , though his intense performance is one of the film ' s highlights . adrienne corri ( vampire circus ) distinguishes herself as de wolff ' s partner in crime , and there ' s a feast of familiar faces in supporting roles , including francis matthews ( dracula : prince of darkness ) , betta st . john ( the city of the dead ) , finlay currie and nigel green . superb art direction ( by anthony masters ) and cinematography ( geoffrey faithful ) .  the first film was quite hip and had amusing moments , this film doesn ' t exactly have the same standard . calvin palmer ( ice cube ) is still trying to keep his barbershop going , but this isn ' t just against stylist gina ( queen latifah ) with a beauty shop next door , but soon enough a big barbershop chain called nappy cutz opening across the street . calvin , along with co-workers and friends eddie ( cedric the entertainer ) , jimmy ( sean patrick thomas ) , terri ( eve ) and isaac rosenberg ( troy garity ) , they are doing everything they can to keep regular customers coming , and ultimately their business running against the competition . also starring michael ealy as ricky nash , leonard earl howze as dinka , harry lennix as quentin leroux , robert wisdom as alderman brown , jazsmin lewis as jennifer , kenan thompson as kenard and bad company ' s garcelle beauvais-nilon as loretta . i didn ' t like this film as much as the first because of the unnecessary flashbacks about eddie , and it isn ' t as witty , i just got bored of it . okay !  i have been collecting iron man comics since the early 70s and always enjoyed the character who is far far from the average clean cut hero and his many and varied enemies . there have been no less than three attempts at an animated series for iron man and only the original and part of the second have ever done the character justice . so i was somewhat hopeful that this newest version would be good . boy was i wrong ! the dvd art is very misleading and presents an image that is not the movie . fist off the good , what little there is . . . the art and animation are well drawn and the writing and dialog are generally good , though with notable exceptions . character voices are very well selected and each character is distinctive and well acted . now for the bad . . . unfortunately the writers opted to totally screw around with both iron man ' s origin and especially the mandarin ' s . on top of that they decided to do iron man and his opponents all in cgi . bad cgi . this makes them stand out almost as badly as live actors would in a cartoon . the cg work is often repetitive and glaring shortcuts are taken at times . the cg battles are clumsy as well , further enhancing the fact that cg and line animation do not mix well . the movie would certainly have fared better had they opted to actually draw all the characters . another problem is that iron man is in his traditional red and gold suit for all of one battle ! and its not even the big fight at the end . all this drags the movie down and it never picks up . 

 * * * * * * * * * * * * spoilers ( or warnings ) may follow * * * * * * * * * * * * 

the movie starts off with an interestingly unusual stop motion credit sequence of machinery , welding and gears . then we are introduced to what looks like a chinese temple in the process of being restored , and prominent is a statue of what fans will recognize as the mandarin . things go strangely , impeding progress in restoring the temple . overseeing it is james rhodes , tony stark ' s long time friend . seems they plan to actually raise the temple up from the earth , despite opposition by a group who insist that raising the temple will bring about a terrible disaster . rhodes is captured in a raid . stark , shown in a hot tub with a lovely lady , is informed of the problems and sets out to personally oversee the project and rescue his friend while in the background his father deals with board executives who are pushing to have tony removed . tony arrives only to have his armored escort ambushed and blown to pieces . tony later awakens mortally wounded in the heart and a prisoner of the rebels . he is saved only by quick action from rhodes and a scientist . eventually stark must build the prototype gray iron armor and makes good an escape , but only after some loss of life . while with the rebels he meets a troubled girl named li mei , and the two fall in love . the temple is raised and four elemental beings ( all done in cg ) appear and proceed to start collecting hidden rings of power . stark and rhody find trouble back home but manage to confront the elementals without success in really stopping them , first using the aquatic armor , then the more classic red and gold armor and finally everything returns to the temple and stark is back in the bulky gray armor for a final showdown and a run in with what may be fin fang foom ( also in cg . ) here the story takes a major twist as it turns out that the mandarin needs a host body to manifest . this leads to a somewhat tragic final battle marred by the fact that the mandarin is little more than a ghost and isn ' t seen till the last 5 minutes of the movie . ugh . . . 

if you are an iron man fan then you will likely not enjoy this outing . and even non-fans may well find the movie somewhat lacking or not .  hollywood had a long love affair with bogus arabian nights tales but few of these products have stood the test of time . the most memorable were the jon hall , maria montez films which have long since become camp . this one is filled with dubbed songs , anachronistic slang , and slapstick . it ' s a truly bounteous crop of mesopotamian corn , and pretty near intolerable today . it was nominated for its imaginative special effects which are almost unnoticeable in this day and age , consisting mainly of trick photography . the only outstanding , positive feature which survives is its beautiful color and clarity . sad to say , of the many films made in this genre , few of them come up to alexander korda ' s original " thief of baghdad " . almost any other arabian nights film is superior to this one , though . it ' s a loser .  pepe le moko , played by charles boyer , is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout europe , and to stay free he holes himself up in the casbah , a mysterious part of algiers where even the police are reluctant to go , until a senior officer is sent from paris to capture le moko once and for all . for le moko , although the casbah allows him to remain out of police custody , it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time - a place he can ' t leave , because the moment he does , he knows he ' ll be arrested . 

boyer ' s performance was good , and i can understand why he was nominated for an oscar . he captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time . the movie itself , unfortunately , was quite a letdown . a number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent , of which i ' ll mention two . first was the idea that the police wouldn ' t enter the casbah . that was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander , and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the casbah fairly regularly . so , neither the suggestion by commissioner janvier that the police wouldn ' t enter , nor the statement by inspector slimane ( also a decent performance by joseph calleia ) that they could get into the casbah but not out seemed to make much sense . i also found it difficult to believe that le moko - hardened criminal mastermind that he was - could be so quickly swept off his feet by gaby ( hedy lamarr ) to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the casbah to find her , essentially giving himself up . i understand the irony of the final few scenes , of course , as pepe leaves the freedom of his prison ( the casbah ) only to find real freedom in his capture ( because he ' s shot and killed by the police . ) i just found it impossible to believe that someone like le moko would fall into such a trap . 

this is worth watching for boyer , and to a lesser extent calleia , but the story is disappointing and inconsistent . 3 / 10 if jacqueline mckenzie and john lynch weren ' t such talented actors this film would probably be even worse than it actually is . the story of two mentally disturbed people who fall in love and have a baby is an interesting one , and well worth exploring . however on the negative side , the plot becomes increasingly over the top as the story progresses , and the music choices more and more bizarre , so that by the end i found myself laughing when i know the director intended for me to be crying .  shirley temple ' s films for twentieth century fox aren ' t negligible because they ' re poorly-made ( darryl f . zanuck supervised most of them , after all ) ; they don ' t retain much of a " classic " stature among cinema aficionados mainly because they ' re weighed down with the syrupy optimism of depression-era hollywood . 1930s audiences were placated by the delight of seeing a dimply , often orphaned sunshine girl making the grown-ups look foolish by comparison ( they fretted and wrung their hands while she danced her troubles away ) . seen these many years later , temple ' s vehicles barely get by on story ( aided always by musical sequences to bolster the content ) , and her timing ( always too-perfect ) and exaggerated reactions might leave most modern viewers rolling their eyes . no one could possibly be blamed for their exasperation over temple ' s performance here ( shouting lines at the top of her lungs ) or the perverseness of her dance steps , sashaying with a crowd of sailors to " at the codfish ball " . still , the fantasy aspect of this particular story , previously filmed in 1924 from the book by laura e . richard , is enough to captivate those in the proper saccharine spirit . seems shirl was pulled from a shipwreck by a government-appointed lighthouse keeper , but when a truant officer from the state board finds out the tyke isn ' t in school , she threatens to take the kid away . it doesn ' t really matter if the prune-faced officer has a point that temple isn ' t being raised properly ( the woman is turned into the proverbial villainess almost immediately ) ; one can see right away that temple can hold her own , taking care of herself and her elderly guardian in the bargain ( as well as the local widow who has her hooks in for the captain ) . temple isn ' t the only one overly-rehearsed ; guy kibbee ' s january is cued for wide-eyed reactions so often you wonder if maybe if he didn ' t film them all in one day . the dialogue is steeped in waterfront metaphors ( " you can ' t rush a trout ! " . . . " well , don ' t give up the ship ! ) , and something about the whole enterprise seems strangely pixilated . * * from * * * *  i was expecting a documentary covering the 1950 to 1965 era of sci-fi and received a big ol ' commercial laced with leftist political innuendo by james cameron and movie mogul baby boomer ' s pushing the own works . ' watch the skies ' has in the past referred to the ' giant bug ' and ' space exploration ' movies from the 1950 ' s including such favorites as " earth vs . the flying saucers , " thing from another world " and " forbidden planet " as well as " them " , " deadly mantis " and " tarantula " . there are lower budget examples that rarely get mentioned like " space monster " , " 12 to the moon " and " cosmic man " . 

this would have been a much better documentary had the few remaining actors , directors , stunt men and collectors plus the non-hollywood ' boomer ' s from the era been interviewed . i only wish there was a " 0 " rating available since a " 1 " is much to generous .  i went to see this 3 nights ago here in cork , ireland . it was the world premiere of it , in the tiny cinema in the triskel arts centre as part of the cork film festival . 

i found " strange fruit " to be an excellent movie . it is a bit rough around the edges , but for a low-budget movie that is to be expected ! in general the acting ( particularly from the main lead kent faulcon ) is wonderful , the cinematography and direction excellent , and the script hugely entertaining and thought-provoking , with some nice set-ups and witty dialogue . 

the ending was a bit sudden , with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end . . . but perhaps that ' s what the filmmakers were going for ? it certainly did make the movie more unsettling . i did like the fact that the main character never came to terms with his mother on screen : it leaves you wondering whether or not he ever will , as in real-life sometimes these things are never settled . this was a good choice , to leave it unresolved rather than sentimentally wrapping it up ! 

taut and suspenseful throughout , " strange fruit " is a hugely ambitious debut and i have high hopes for what the writer / director kyle schickner will unleash next . he - and his colleagues - are a talent worth watching . 

i hope " strange fruit " gets a wider release soon , as more people deserve to see this movie , an above-average thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in america ' s deep south . 

highly recommended : 7 / 10 when at the very start of the film paleontologist donald sutherland arrives at the argyle family ' s house and it comes out he is the undeniable alibi for one of the members executed for murdering his mother two years ago your sensation is that you are about to watch a top thriller ; an innocent man has been convicted and a killer is still around . but as the film runs along your disappointment increases inevitably . 

 " ordeal by innocence " is a dull and at times even boring film that doesn ' t raise at any moment . nothing interesting happens all along and even the final revealing of the facts lacks surprise and intensity ( wether you guessed or not ) . 

donald sutherland , cristopher plummer , faye dunaway and sarah miles ( far from her good performance in " ryan ' s daughter " ) just pass through their roles and not very enthusiastically either . 

you won ' t miss much if you skip this one .  well , i must say , i initially found this short to be quite average , but having watched it nearly 5 times since ( its constantly shown on ifc ) , i ' ve developed an enjoyment of the simple plot elements and reality of the situations presented . sofia coppola contributes a solid addition to the category .  i can only guess that this movie was an experiment that misfired . years earlier , it would have been moving images accompanied by music . later , it would have been sound added to silents . eventually it would have been technicolor , cinemascope or imax . this movie must have been a misguided attempt to introduce a new element to the talking picture . during all the emotional scenes , the character stops in mid dialogue and their inner thoughts are narrated while they gaze off into the distance or appeal to the camera . this interruption is painful at it ' s very least . imagine these top tier actors trying to look busy while the narration drones on . painful . i have no idea who came up with this gimmick , but it was the only time i ever saw it used - and for good reason . in every scene the actors were forced to roll their eyes , wring their hands , or overact to such a degree , i actually wondered if this was really a comedy . 

the story is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over a couple of generations . norma shearer , disappointed in love , searches for a reason to live . she has a friend , played by ralph morgan , who worships her - but she takes him for granted . she is attracted to a doctor , played by clark gable , but he is self absorbed and isn ' t interested in her . she settles for a weakling that needs her desperately . she marries him only to find that there is insanity in his family and she can never have a child with him . along comes the doctor who selfishly pops a bun in her oven , only to find out later that he loves her after all . the child builds confidence in her husband who becomes a success , but she realizes that it ' s really clark she loves after all . confused yet ? forget the rest , just watch a couple of episodes of " as the world turns " and it ' ll all become clear . 

if your are ever forced to watch this movie , hold out for the final scene . the gyrations of the actors put harold lloyd to shame . it is not to be missed .  carole lombard and james stewart gamely try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarrely constructed film about the tribulations of a newlywed couple . the scenes play as if they were parceled out among various directors , each with a different goal . some are capra-cute , some screwball , some melodramatic , and some surprisingly noir . there ' s even an extended adventure sequence , when the plot suddenly focuses on a small plane flying through a blizzard . it ' s hard to say which scenes are the most incongruous , when the film as a whole is so erratic in tone , and the storyline not exactly believable . only worth watching for film students or fans of the actors--some smaller parts , such as judge doolittle and the intrepid pilot , are also very well played .

an artist ( marta becket ) and her husband many decades ago left the hustle and bustle and culture of new york and moved to a god-forsaken town with a population of 10 in death valley . there , they renovated a theater--painting it is a very home-spun / folk art manner . and , once finished , she bega putting on dancing performances for practically no one . in many ways , it ' s highly reminiscent of the werner herzog film fitzcarraldo or field of dreams--though amargosa is a documentary of a real person--not a mythical crazy man like klaus kinski or kevin costner . her husband eventually leaves--much of it apparently because of the lifestyle she chose . so , today she lives on with her ten cats and a sanctuary for burros eventually along with her new male companion , tom . 

what you think about this documentary depends on your perspectives . if you are into new age ideas and open to these sensibilities , then you ' ll more likely appreciate the film . her talking about how she remembers her birth , ghosts , vision quests and psychics frankly made the psychology teacher in me cringe and this would definitely be the case for many people . in addition , her burro sanctuary and trying to preserve horses in the desert will most likely appeal to peta and many other animal lovers , though with my background in environmental concerns and biology , i see the burros and horses as a blight that would destroy the native plants and animals . so on two different accounts , i tend to think quite the opposite of marta--who is more of a " feeler " and " sensing " individual . depending on how you feel about all this will definitely color your opinions--and i am pretty sure most people will either think she ' s a genius or a nut ! you ' ll just have to guess what i think . 

now despite all this , the film is interesting and marta ' s life is definitely not dull--particularly since in recent years , people have actually begun taking trips to the desert to see her perform . there is a definite following for her and her unusual little world . while i would not be nearly as positive as most reviews , i also can ' t be as negative as the one review , as there is definite merit to this odd documentary . i like films about unusual people and marta certainly is unusual ! i also appreciate her love of her art and happy life--that is a rare gift . 

i teach psychology at an arts school and it sure would be interesting to show this to the staff--where i am pretty sure we ' d get a strong positive and negative reaction to the film--probably depending on whether the teachers taught the arts classes or core curriculum ! it sure would be interesting . 

by the way , and i am not trying to be sarcastic , but when marta ' s husband was having affairs , with whom did this occur ? ! after all , they lived in the middle of no where and i was left wondering where he ' d find partners . 

by the way , if you ' d like to see her perform and / or stay at her hotel , it can be found at www . amargosaoperahouse . com / . the site is in english , french and german and hotel rates are pretty reasonable as are ticket prices .  hypothetical situations abound , one-time director harry ralston gives us the ultimate post-apocalyptic glimpse with the world dead , left in the streets , in the stores , and throughout the landscape , sans in the middle of a forgotten desert . one lone survivor , attempting to rekindle his sanity , takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert . all alone , he hopes for more , but with nobody around , he is left with white underwear , and a passion for a local indian tribe Â until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and breaks the barriers of human co-existence . alan , a man of the book , is left on earth after an unknown disaster . thinking he is alone , he begins living life his way Â until , jeri ryan , appears ( like she would in any dream ) out of the woods , disheveled , and unhappy to find the final man alive to be . . . well . . . like alan . anyway , they try to co-exist , fail , get drunk , and before creating the ultimate dystopia , they run into redneck raphael ( played by newcomer Â dan montgomery jr ) . bonds are torn , confusion sets in , a couple becomes a third wheel , and the battle between physically inept nerd vs . brainless jock . even with nobody left on the planet , it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arise . 

using a variable film technique , ralston gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled " the quiet earth " ( which i will be viewing next ) oddly which he never gives any credit towards . with a borrowed story , i guess he does a decent job of reinterpreting it . his punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while ralston tries to find his stride , borrowing yet again from other film director ' s techniques to attempt to find his own . he opens the film interestingly enough , but fails to answer any direct answers . sure , the final days have arrived , but could there be a concise answer as to " how " or better yet " why " these select few survived . a spookier beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film . the juxtaposition would have been like " shawn of the dead " , but instead left us feeling like we were watching a " made-for-tv " program . listening to the audio commentary , i have respect for ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made , and his passion nearly sells the film , but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasn ' t as happy with his overall final product . there were mistakes , ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out . while this does make for decent independent film-making , it sometimes feels cheap , and in ralston ' s case , it was the latter . 

i must admit , david arnott ' s portrayal of alan hooked me . he played that wimpy , school nerd , adult role very well . he was funny to both watch and listen to , and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer . he was a key player in keeping the film together , alas , i cannot say the same for the rest . this was dan montgomery ' s first film , and it was obvious Â i mean Â really really obvious . there were scenes in which i thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him , perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance , but alas , it wasn ' t the case . then there was jeri ryan . she pulled into her character near the end of the film , which to me , was the culmination of the entire piece of art . she goes from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end . confused ? again , she fell into her character by the end , giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting matured . even as the commentary progressed , all that she contributed was a laugh , giggle , or " ohhh , look at that color " moment . while her beauty may sell tickets , one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful . this was her first film , so can i be too harsh ? 

overall , this film felt like it was missing something . i though the idea was strong Â the premise that even with only a peppering of people remaining on the earth the evil of human nature still exists . jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs ( maybe because it is consumed by zinc ? ) and we as a race will always want what we cannot have . ralston is not a surprising director , his techniques are flawed and pre-used , but he does know how to make a low-budget comedy . i think our idea of " funny " is different , so that is why i couldn ' t find myself laughing at many of the bits he found " hysterical " . his actors provided the level of acting needed for this film , which was lower than average . his film was loose , meaning that there were elements never quite explained or tackled ( i . e . anything with wings survived ? ! ? ) , which overall harmed the intensity of the film . this was a comedy , but it could have been much darker and much much funnier . for those thinking that roger avery was a huge element to this film , as we learn from their commentary , all he was there for was money Â the was in essence , the bank for " the last man " . don ' t get your hopes up for any classic avery moments . 

don ' t expect more from ralston Â and that is how i will end it . 

grade : * * out of * * * * *  the film is somewhat entertaining , but the greatest feature is shalom harlow ' s laughable performance . it has been 4 years since this movie was released and hopefully harlow has gone through more training . perhaps she should stick to the more worldly , somewhat corruptive characters that she has generated in other performances .  i saw bogard when it was released in the 70s . it was one of those pictures that received an x rating for violence . we snuck into our local grindhouse , and saw it anyway . pretty good picture . lots of blood from the street fights , although the cheap sound effects for the punches took something away from it . and lots of sex . i remember one of the early scenes when bogard meets this pretty brunette in an apartment she is showing him . without saying a word , he picks her up , puts her in the windowsill and nails her . from what i remember the picture sailed from that point on . so , when i found out bogart is also called black fist and was available on vhs , i ordered it online . i was very disappointed . black fist is bogard edited for television . so many of the scenes i remember were missing , i wondered if indeed , this was the same picture .  the use of " astral projection " ( wandering soul ) , to exist outside of body , with the result inflicting horrible death ( . . crushing the insides of victims leading to broken spine and ruptured organs ) on those close to the one with such ability , is the threat of eternal evil , providing karen black ( . . as janus ) with another " unique " character to fool around with as a woman who influences a commercial director , paul sharpe ( winston rekert ) tired of his waning marriage and dull career . in actuality , she ' s dying and needs his body , her spirit potentially harmful to his wife and son ( . . his son has a " special friend " who talks him into things , even poisoning himself at one point ) . a detective , kauffman ( john novak ) investigating the unusual homicides concerning those killed by the benevolent spirit , links paul to the deaths and through him uncovers janus . soon both realize that janus must be stopped or she ' ll simply move to another human host . what paul doesn ' t know is that his new secretary is janus ' lover , both were actually older intellectuals featured in his documentary of astral projection called wandering soul . 

director george mihalka ( my bloody valentine ) certainly creates a weird atmosphere with this movie which contains a rather bizarre premise . it seems that paul ' s boy can see the spirit moving in the shape of a " blue man " , manipulating the kid into disorderly conduct . black , despite the star treatment , rarely is shot close up taking advantage of her face which can produce the type of malevolent evil her character warrants . instead , she ' s shot from afar , her voice dubbed , and she never quite establishes herself with the proper menace which is an opportunity lost , in my opinion . for some reason , despite the intriguing ( . . if oddball ) idea of astral projection causing a spirit to kill folks from within , the film just never takes off . the soundtrack is very " yanni-ish " and the lighting ( . . and sound ) , while at times moody and effective , often is quite murky . the pacing is a problem , also , as the story mules along . the cast is rather limp , especially rekert in the lead , his performance erratic , at best . it doesn ' t help that there are few characters ( . . except paul ' s wife ) we could care less about , and what really hurts is that paul himself isn ' t exactly the most lovable person in the world . . he can be quite difficult and moody , his unfulfilled career a reason for such behavior . black should ' ve been a more prominent figure in the film , yet remains mostly in the background , talked about in dialogue between paul and kauffman , but rarely does she get a chance to amuse us with her histrionics , which is a shame .  what a disaster ! normally , when one critiques a historical movie , it ' s always fun to point out the inaccuracies that slip in , usually added by the writers to create more " dramatic " situations . however , " imperium : nerone " is a whole ' nuther kind of animal . in this movie you strain to find anything at all that is confirmed by the historical record amidst the farrago of nonsense and fiction presented as the life of rome ' s bad-boy artist-emperor . 

and it ' s a pity , because nero is one of the most fascinating of all the roman emperors . his life was filled with enough tumultuous events and interesting people to make a really good movie . the producers of this mess chose another route , which leads only to head-scratching on the part of any informed viewer . 

just a few examples : 

1 . nero is depicted as an 6-8 year old boy when caligula has his father killed for treason , exiles his mother agrippina , and sends the boy to be raised by slaves in the countryside . " ten years later , " the story resumes just before the assassination of caligula . facts : nero was born about six months after caligula began his four year reign , and was only three when he was assassinated ; nero ' s father died of natural causes ; agrippina was briefly exiled for bad behavior , not treason ; and nero was not raised among slaves , but had the typical upbringing of a young member of the imperial family . 

2 . okay , according to the writers , nero is now about 16 when his great uncle claudius becomes emperor ( in fact he was about to turn 4 ) ; agrippina engineers the downfall of the empress messalina and marries claudius , who adopts nero . then he goes off to conquer britain , and is poisoned by agrippina soon after his victorious return . nero is declared emperor , although he ' s still perhaps only 18 or 19 years old . fact : claudius conquered britain in 43 a . d . , two years after beginning his reign . he lived until 54 a . d . nero should have been 31 years old by then by any normal chronology , but in fact succeeded to the throne at age 16 . 

history tells us that there then followed the " five good years , " where nero ruled wisely and well under the tutelage of the philosopher seneca and the praetorian commander burrus . this is shown -- sort of -- except that portraying the roman senate as opposing nero ' s good measures is false . senatorial opposition to nero only commenced when he started to show signs of insanity and began killing senators for real or imagined treason . 

3 . nero ' s mother agrippina is the controlling sort , who murdered her uncle-husband to make her son emperor . after a while , nero tires of her meddling and decides to kill her . in the movie , he sends his henchman tigellinus to stab her to death . all true enough , but the reality was so much better ! agrippina was a survivor , and didn ' t go easily . nero tried three times to poison her , but as an old poisoner herself she was savvy to all that , and he failed . then he tried to crush her to death by collapsing the ceiling of her bedchamber , but that also failed . next , he sent her on a voyage on a ship that was deliberately constructed to fall apart and sink ; as it went down , she jumped into the sea and swam to shore . finally , he had her stabbed to death . now showing all that would have definitely improved this movie ! 

other errors abound : nero ' s lover acte was not a childhood slave-friend , she never repudiated him , and there is no evidence that she became a christian . nero did not commit suicide by slitting his wrists while sitting beside a lake . etc . etc . etc . 

the sources for nero ' s life are primarily the roman historians tacitus and suetonius , both of whom were of the senatorial class hostile to him and his memory . but the evidence indicates that he remained very popular with the common people , unlike one of the final scenes where he is pelted by the mob with vegetables as he leaves the city to commit suicide . 

why did the writers and producers take an inherently interesting story with plenty of good stuff for any movie , and make this piece of crap ? oh , and did i mention how cheesy the sets and costumes were ? lol . 

one star , because there ' s no way to rate it lower .  for me this movie was a disappointment . somehow i expected that it would explain the reason for general rommel ' s popularity and his success as a military strategist in ww ii . but there is none of that , it deals with the last year or two of his life and tries , in a way , to whitewash him . so i just have to suppose that rommel was primarily an amoral and apolitical technocrat in the conquering and killing business , without any particular charm or notoriety in behaviour . such real life people just do not make good movie material . i almost feel sorry for james mason , really one of my favorite actors , who had to impersonate a pretty wooden character . actually , a good director and a lot of great acting talent was wasted on this movie Â with the exception of luther adler who gives a really memorable and weirdly naturalistic portrayal of adolf hitler . 

there might also be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the german speaking world . famous british actors impersonating germans are just not credible . rommel , for example , is perceived here not just as a german but as a typical Âsoutherner " from baden-wÃ¼rttemberg . you immediately think of a certain dialect , a certain kind of wit , a certain way of seeing the world ( the total opposite of eg a prussian Âjunker " ) . i also think that there are now mixed feelings about the assassination attempt of july 20th , many of those who were in on the conspiracy were not democrats and just wanted the german troops to join the western allies against the advancing bolsheviks ( thus prolonging the war forever ) . 

the best movie portrayal of an intellectual , intelligent military mind is in my opinion still patton ( 1970 ) . incidentally , general patton can be glimpsed for a short moment in the ample documentary footing used for this movie , a low angle shot while he is inspecting passing vehicles . the open holster and the revolver with the mother of pearl grips are clearly visible !  i was thrilled by the fresh ( pun intended ) synopsis of this film and looking forward to watch it . the first few shots introduce some of the characters as well as the main location where the stories take place ; the gardening allotments . the movie looks fantastic . colorful yet simple . magical yet genuine . unfortunately , it only takes a few minutes to figure out where the movie will go . we quickly figure out this will be a manipulative , sappy tale illustrating a bunch of jaded people set in their ways confronted by " nice victimized " refugees and that it will have a happy ending where the jaded people realize the error of their ways and accept these people . 

the characters , particularly the prejudiced ones , are very " comic-booky " in nature . the story focuses mainly on two refugee families . one of them is headed by a single mom played atrociously by diveen henry . i am saddened to say that any emotion that might have been felt toward her struggles were defused by what was memorably bad acting . 

the other story is much more interesting and focuses on a father and his two children . all are scarred by their journey to this country by way of containers , where the wife and mother died but it is the husband who suffers the most . benedict wong gives a mind-blowing performance here . at first , his emotions are very subdued but as the story develops , he subtly makes us aware of the inner-struggles of his character . 

unfortunately , the rest of the movie is just extremely boring . there were so many possibilities with this movie . there are several characters to keep track of , many of which might have potential but none of it is realized . even worse , despite this movie being very much not hollywoodian , some of the main plot threads are solved cheaply in a hollywood b-grade way . example : 

character a likes character b character b rejects his advances no problem ! let ' s have character c declare her love for character a so we can all have a happy ending . yawn . 

i liked very much the plot thread of the asian family . that was well done . unfortunately , the whole allotment business , the communal aspect of it , the dynamic involving a large cast are all under exploited . 

what you ' re left with is a movie that has very little worth .  as a young lass , beautiful joan woodbury ( as rita adams ) was orphaned , after her " stool pigeon " father was shot to death . as a young woman , ms . woodbury finds herself struggling to keep a job , as her murdered father ' s ex-convict status makes woodbury a bad business risk . woodbury rooms with understanding songstress linda ware ( as donna andrews ) , who advises woodbury to get in touch with old orphanage friends john archer ( as bob elliott ) and jack la rue ( as mickey roman ) . but , none of her friends can help when woodbury is the victim of a scam , which lands her in prison . upon release , woodbury decides to give the male mobsters a run for their money 

re-titled " gangs , inc . " , this is an obviously weak , cheap mobster melodrama . still , it ' s a lot of fun to watch woodbury work wonders with inferior material . she plays the innocent growing more sophisticated " rita " quite convincingly ; and , she tosses in a great bit as a blonde hooker . woodbury must be added to the list of unfortunately underutilized hollywood actresses of the past . " paper bullets " also features an early alan ladd ( as jimmy kelly aka bill dugan ) . ms . ware , who sang the hit " an apple for the teacher " with bing crosby , sings a couple of fair ' 40s numbers nicely . but , mainly , it ' s woodbury ' s show . 

 * * * * paper bullets ( 1941 ) phil rosen ~ joan woodbury , linda ware , alan ladd what a disappointment ! i ' ve enjoyed the jon cleary books about scobie malone , but there ' s little resemblance between him and the cinematic malone . in the books he ' s a city detective , who is devoted to his wife and doesn ' t get involved in fisticuffs . for the film the character has been spiced up , into an outback copper who uses his fists and isn ' t averse to jumping into bed with a gorgeous girl , though quite what she and the film ' s other sex interest see in him i don ' t know ; taylor was 39 at the time and his face was getting puffy . 

but his character ' s stamina is remarkable ; he flies in from australia , apparently goes straight to the commissioner ' s house ( rather unwisely seeking to arrest him during a black-tie reception ) , saves him from assassination ( getting into a fight in the process ) , goes to a casino with one girl , leaves with another and takes her to bed . so much for jet lag ! on the way back to the commissioner ' s house ( showing a good knowledge of london back streets ) , he gets beaten up by the baddies , but is still first down to breakfast ! it ' s also remarkable that the commissioner ' s limo has its windscreen and headlights miraculously repaired within minutes of the assassination attempt and that one character has a touching faith in the precise timekeeping of a clock-activated bomb . 

the best thing is joseph the butler ' s disdain for the uncouth malone . and at least the film avoids being a london travelogue , though some scenes take place during the wimbledon tennis week .  i was out-of-town , visiting an old friend . after dinner , talking , he expressed some reservations about his daughter ' s boy friend . she ' s 15 , beautiful , smart , athletic , and the young man is also from an excellent family , nice , also athletic ( if not as smart ) . i told him he might just be feeling the normal fatherly concerns ; however , a few minutes later the young man arrived , with his dvd of this flick , which he had apparently been anxious for some time to share with the others . 

these folks have a bona fide home theater set-up , with a screen something in excess of 4 feet , and the two young folks preceded to view it , while the young swain proceeded to extol its virtues almost frame-by-frame . 

i saw enough in a few moments ( and with some fascination in its awfulness ) to endorse all of the most critical comments i ' ve seen in scanning some here . 

i told my friend i wouldn ' t go so far as to disqualify the young suitor solely on the basis of his liking this opus -- but it certainly seems to warrant his bearing close watch . 

some flicks are so-bad-they ' re-good : the classic " plan 9 from outer space ; " and , in my opinion , the wonderfully awful bruce jenner / village people work , " can ' t stop the music . " 

however , this one remains firmly simply in the awful category . 

second / third / fourth " bananas " -- even the best of these ( e . g . tim conway , don knotts , everybody with seinfeld ) have great difficulty in carrying a later starring series ( or , as here , film ) . and these were great supporting characters in their original situations . 

the " eddie " character , really at about the 5th- or 6th-banana level in the prior griswald movies , and never added a whole lot to these , in my opinion . randy quaid is a capable actor who has delivered some good performances . his contribution to the prior " vacation " pic ' s was average , at best . both he and the other cast members , many of whom have done some good work in the past , accomplished nothing for their efforts here , except to derive a few years ' house payments or some ira contributions . 

this whole presentation --- story , performances ( from lead to support ) couldn ' t be worse .   " the thomas crown affair " is a terrible remake of a not-very-good movie , redeemable only for the topless shots of former supermodel renee russo . 

that ' s it . the plot is negligible , pierce brosnan phoned in his part , and dennis leary ( as usual ) plays an annoying irish cop , but i couldn ' t take my eyes off the beautiful ms . russo . there ' s an okay love-making scene on a stairway , a terrifically sexy ballroom dance , a topless beach scene , and a roll in the sack . oh , and there ' s a painting stolen from a museum and a catamaran gets sunk . 

but let ' s hope other directors recognize ms . russo ' s perky attributes and cast her in more , highly-visible roles .  german emigree and uber-hambone actor paul muni who never saw a scene he didn ' t want to chew up goes " blackface " to play a humble mexican immigrant living in los angeles and working his way up in the world . if this creaky vehicle reminds anyone of al pacino ' s minstrel performance as an uncultured cuban in the remake of scarface , don ' t be too surprised . the characters are quite similar , and both get wildly pop-eyed when the script calls for it . hispanics everywhere should be greatly offended by muni ' s over-the-top performance as this giddy mexican living the american dream , consequences be damned . i guess benicio deltoro ' s grandfather wasn ' t available . a young , bleached-blonde bette davis plays one of muni ' s love interests ; she eventually goes insane for love of mr . meh-hee-can muni . an absolute hoot , davis is the sole reason to watch this racially offensive claptrap . there is an absolutely delirious near the end when muni asks the gal of his dreams to marry him -- a white gal of breeding with one of those stilted , stage-like ' 30s accents that hollywood loved so much -- and she calls him a savage and a brute , of " a different tribe . " muni immediately transforms into mr . hyde and chases her to an untimely death . in the final scene , a repentant muni tells his sober-faced priest that he is going back to his own people , his own kind . end of movie . finis . that ' s all she wrote . muni was said to have hired a gen-oo-ine mexican as a chauffeur in order to study this exotic creature ' s speech pattern and physical habits . yowza !   ( some spoilers ) prc quickie that has j . carrol naish playing dr . igor markoff who ' s not really dr . karkoff but an impostor who took over his identity back in europe . 

the real dr . karkoff had a affair with dr . markoff ' s wife that lead to him to murder the real dr . markoff and then having his wife lenore infected with acromegaly that made her look like the " elephant man ' s " sister . this was done so that no one would ever want to look at her and he could keep lenore all to himself ; but the disturbed lenore later got even with her insane husband by killing herself . 

this nut , the fake dr . markoff , then spots patricia lawrence , wanda mckay , one evening at the theater where her father tony lawernce , ralph morgan , a world famous pianist is giving a concert . enchanted by the lovely patricia who ' s a dead ringer for his dead wife lenore dr . markoff becomes obsessed with her and goes to extreme lengths to marry her even though she ' s want ' s nothing to do with him . 

after getting ridicules in his efforts to get patricia to fall in love with him , by sending her flowers with syrupy love notes attached to then as much as five times a day , tony goes to see the crazed dr . mankoff to tell him to stop annoying his daughter . it ' s then that tony ends up getting knocked out by the good doctor who has him injected with a dose of acromegaly that turns him into a somewhat unsightly fellow . with his hands and body swelling up and not being able to play his beloved piano tony is told by his doctor dr . adams , sam flint , that the only one who can cure him of that dreadful disease is non other then dr . markoff ! the person who gave it to him . 

the movie has the usual sub-plots with dr . markoff ' s assistant maxine , tala birell , who ' s also in love with him jealous of the phony doctor making a play for patricia . there ' s also dr . markoff ' s hulking butler glenn strange who , like his pet gorilla , is just a big clumsy oaf who can ' t even subdue maxine who ' s less the half the size . strange ends up getting bopped on the head and knocked out cold by patricia ' s boyfriend bobby blake , terry frost . as for the gorilla he turns out to be but a big hairy wimp when he also tries to do in maxine and is chased away , and locks himself back up in his cage , by the pet dog ace . dr . markoff in his desperation to get patricia to marry him promises her to cure her dad only to have her father break out of his chains and in the ensuing struggle with him ends up shooting markoff dead with his own gun . 

there is a happy ending to this whole mess with maxine , who knew as much about markoff ' s cure for acromegaly as he did , injecting tony with a secret serum that made him as good as new . the movie ends , like it started , with tony playing the piano to a packed and cheering house at the local theater .  with hong kong heart-throb andy lau and veteran star ching wan lau , " aau chin " has everything going for it for the beginning part of the movie , unfortunately , the movie falls apart at the end . 

andy lau plays a sophisticated thief who only has 4 weeks to live , but still has one thing unfinished . . . he pulls an elaborated scheme tricking the police into helping him . . . however , the police is hot on his tail . . . . can he pull it off before being caught ? 

the build up of the movie is good . bits of pieces of clues are left behind for the audiences to try to guess at the real intention . unfortunately , the build up leads to a disappointed final showdown . it feels as if in the middle of the script , the writer has changed and that all the build-up becomes disconnected . 

a 3 / 10 . . . .  the 1977 animated-live action hybrid version of gulliver ' s travels ( or rather ' travel , ' since he only gets as far as lilliput ) didn ' t get much of a release , and it ' s not too difficult to see why . michel legrand comes up with some catchy tunes , but they merely inspire lyricist don black to the likes of " one simple fact remains / no-one here suffers from growing pains . ' richard harris once again over-indulges in his passion for excessive makeup , toning down the eyeliner for far too much foundation this time in an effort to hide the fact he ' s at least 25 years too old for the role , but at least he ( perhaps inappropriately ) reduces his larger-than-life tendencies for a performance made up mainly of patronising whispering . the belgian animation looks only slightly better than early morning french children ' s tv , but peter hunt ' s film is not nearly as bad as it sounds Â the use of real model sets for the animated characters harks back to max and dave fleischer ' s 1939 version while a couple of moments of swiftian satire do remain - although it ' s definitely aimed at the youngest of children .  one of the most pleasant surprises of this early 3-strip technicolor short was that a ballet dancer that appears here was named maria gambarelli ! i half wondered if blake edwards was naming the character played by elke sommer in a shot in the dark after this now-forgotten performer ( though the spelling of the sommer character ' s surname was actually gambrelli ) . i watched this on youtube mainly to see an early judy garland appearance as we watch her in profile with her two older sisters singing " la cucaracha " . that was the highlight for me which otherwise showed some dances ( like that of ms . gambarelli ) that were enjoyable and some lame comedy between andy devine as a great bull-fighter ( yeah , right ! ) and buster keaton as a bull owner who provides one that is obviously a man in animal costume . only funny part of those two is when they cry-with buster providing handkerchief to " bull " -during the sad part of " la cucaracha " . also lame was seeing ted healy without his stooges dealing with a crasher who keeps mistaking healy for other movie stars . ( healy himself didn ' t know zeppo had left the marx brothers since he puts " four " between " the " and " marx " ! ) speaking of a marx , it was interesting seeing harpo without his wig though he is wearing a hat to hide his bald head . also interesting was seeing ida lupino among the cowgirls in the beginning though i also recognized toby wing from her part in murder at the vanities last year ( at least when announcer pete smith identified her ) . oh , and smith himself wasn ' t funny with his wise-guy narration . other famous stars you may or may not recognize are also in cameos and not all are m-g-m contract players either ! so with all that said , la fiesta de santa barbara is worth a look for anyone curious about judy garland ' s early film appearances or the early use of 3-strip technicolor .  i ' m a boorman fan , but this is arguably his least successful film . comedy has never been his strong suit , and here his attempts at screwball farce are clumsily done . still , it ' s almost worth seeing for boorman ' s eye for talent : this is one of uma thurman ' s first starring roles , and as always she is ravishing to watch . ( on a sad side note , boorman wrote the script with his daughter , telsche , who died a couple years ago . )   " ghost son " is lamberto bava ' s best film and , at the same time , also his worst . i suppose that statement requires some slight clarification . it ' s his best because it ' s well directed , ambitious , accessible and very stylish , but his worst because it ' s a dull , unoriginal movie and undeniably a huge letdown to all the real fans of bava ' s past efforts . let ' s face it : many fans , myself certainly included , wouldn ' t have been interested in this film judging by the plot , the famous names attached to it and even the boring sounding title . the only motivation here was lamberto bava , who brought us large amounts of convoluted gialli and fun splatter films in the past . " ghost son " is a bit of his comeback film , alongside " the torturer " , and although the latter definitely isn ' t a good film , it at least lives up to his fans ' lines of expectations , with excessive amounts of sleaze , blood and sadism . " ghost son " is a weak and intolerably soft horror film , even talking in terms of mainstream ghost stories . the emphasis lies too much on sentimentality , and this badly affects the already limited number of horrific & creepily atmospheric moments . the basic premise might feature one or two potentially good ideas , but the film is overall dull and far too clichÃ©d . john hannah and laura harring star as a happy couple , living on a remote ranch in south africa and breeding horses for a living . the joy and happiness couldn ' t possibly improve , so naturally something tragic is bound to happen , and it does . mark dies in a car accident , but the inconsolable stacey remains at the ranch where she ' s in constant contact with mark ' s spirit . she even gets pregnant with his child , but shortly after baby martin ' s birth mysterious events begin to occur . it seems as if mark ' s restless and selfish ghost ' possessed ' the baby and uses him to encourage stacy into committing suicide . with all the focus on the couple ' s relationship , many of the events and sub plots are underdeveloped and / or remains unexplained , like the whole background of the youthful maid thandi . there ' s too little action and the only real fright-moments are too obviously borrowed from classic films such as " the exorcist " and " rosemary ' s baby " ( vomiting green goo , self moving furniture ) . purely talking in terms of horrific entertainment " ghost son " is a painful misfire , but it has to be said , it ' s a beautiful and enchanting looking failure . the cinematography is extremely elegant and many camera angles are truly inventive and suggestive . the moody score sometimes even manages to create an ominous atmosphere even though there ' s nothing of any significance happening on screen . there are several beautiful images of the south african wildlife to admire but , if that interests you , i suppose you ' re better off watching national geographic instead . not much to recommend here . fans of atmosphere-driven ghost stories have much better options to choose from and die-hard bava fanatics are advised to ( re- ) watch " demons " , " macabre " or " blade in the dark " .  written by , directed by and starring the champ of camp bruce campbell . easy on its easy to tell this is a budget on a shoestring affair ; filmed independently in bulgaria . all i can really say for sure is that silly is not always funny . campbell plays an affluent american business man with a cheating wife ( antoinette byron ) and trying to close a business transaction before he is murdered . he hires a cabbie to drive him around a strange little town ; not knowing that his wife is ' carrying on ' with the taxi driver . within moments of campbell being bludgeoned ; the cabbie is killed in the same location . a mad scientist ( stacy keach ) proceeds with an experiment putting the cabbie ' s brain inside the american ' s head . with massive stitches on his forehead , campbell breaks free and roams the streets looking for his wife ; all the while he is arguing with a strange voice inside his over-sized head . campbell contorts his rubbery face making silly expressions as he argues with himself . thus , bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased . i get the impression this must have been written as a straight comedy . rounding out the cast are ted raimi , tamara gorski , and vladmir kolev . watch for this on the sci-fi channel .  brooke shields -- in a departure from her " suddenly susan " duties -- plays a bitter divorcee who embroils three girlfriends in a " girls only " weekend in palm springs . the problem : brooke is " unattached " and on the prowl , while her friends are all involved . hence the title implications and emotional backlash their " amoral " weekend causes . 

despite a few laughs generated by dan cortese ( " victoria ' s closet " ) and mtv " relationship authorities " adam corolla and dr . drew pinsky , this is somber stuff for women only . d . b . sweeney , virginia madsen and jon polito co-star .  an american family moves to the countryside of spain to live in an isolated house . regina ( anna paquin ) , the teenager daughter of mark ( iain glen ) , who is sick and has some mental problems , and the nurse maria ( lena olin ) , notes that weird things is happening in the house and with her young brother paul ( stephan enquist ) , but her mother does not believe on her . reggie decides to investigate with her boyfriend carlos ( fele martÃ­nez ) the origins of the house , and they find that forty years ago , the place was the stage of the death of six children . reggie decides to ask for support to her grandfather albert ( giancarlo giannini ) to protect her brother against the house and her father . 

i bought this dvd expecting to see a good horror movie of haunted house mainly because of the names of anna paquin , lena olin , fele martÃ­nez ( from " thesis " and " abre los ojos " ) and giancarlo giannini . further , i like very much spanish cinema . in spite of , i found a terrible screenplay , an awful direction and a deplorable acting of excellent actors and actresses . the intention of the story is good , slightly recalling " the shinning " in some moments , but unfortunately it is badly developed , never being clear , for example , the reasons and motives why the american family moved to spain or the horrible relationship between the members of the family , mainly the situation between maria and reggie . the direction is confused , poorly trying to use dark and shadows to give scary effects to the story . i love anna paquin , but her expressionless face never works in this flick . lena olin is a caricature of the great actress she is ; and stephan enquist is too much weak for such important role . only fele martÃ­nez has a good performance in his support character . i liked the open end of the story . my vote is four . 

title ( brazil ) : " a sÃ©tima vÃ­tima " ( " the seventh victim " )  on humphrey bogart ' s first trip to hollywood , he got his first leading man role in this b picture love affair . the first thing you ought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic love affair later in the decade with charles boyer and irene dunne or the two remakes that followed . it ' s not half as good any of those films . 

in fact bogey is second billed to dorothy mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she ' s been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father ' s best friend and financial adviser hale hamilton . it comes as quite a shock to mackaill . she considers a show business career as a way for an income . 

bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and he ' s designing an ultimate airplane motor and is looking for investors . mackaill is willing to do it , besides she likes what she sees in bogey . 

considering the cynical roles that bogart later made a specialty , it ' s a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in love affair . the part doesn ' t wear well on him . 

love affair is your average b program second feature , nothing terribly special about it .   " disappointing " is the best word i could think for this film , especially considering the glowing reviews it receives from some other users . 

one thing that really spoils the film is that it is unabashedly partial ( in both senses of the word ) . not only does it present a very selective description of the games ( focussing as it does on the us athletics team ) but it also contains several inaccuracies , most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties the us team faced . 

what is even more disturbing is that all the omissions and mistakes ( ? ) , appear to glorify us sportsmanship to the exclusion of other athletes ( with a few celebrated exceptions ) . for example , the viewer is led to believe that the us won the majority of medals in the games , when in fact they won only one out of four gold medals and one out of 6 total . similarly , many athletes are portrayed as caricatures of their respective countrymen ( thus we have an arrogant brit , and a wine-swilling french ) . this attitude does very little service to the olympic ideals that the film is supposed to celebrate . 

in conclusion , i believe that this film would appeal to that part of the us audience that is looking for a quick boost of national self-esteem . those looking for a detailed and historically correct description of the games are advised to look elsewhere .  no way out 2007 was a really bad and if it is the road to wrestlemania they choose the wrong road .

overall this was bulls * it id give it a 3 / 10 i ' ve read the book ' scarlett ' and was expecting a good movie the first time i saw it . i ' m afraid to say that i was disappointed . the movie did not follow the book and made many changes that i did not like . 

one of the changes that i did not like the way that lord fenton was portrayed . it made no sense to make him out to be a bad man . the way that things ended between lord fenton and scarlett was a lot different and their whole relationship was too intimate . 

there was also a lot less confrontation between scarlett and rhett in the movie than was originally written in the book . the movie sent the two in two completely opposite ways and they did not seem to cross paths often enough to make it seem like there still could be love between the two . a fine movie , but i believe that it certainly could ' ve been better than it was , had it more true to alexandra rippley ' s book .  i am a huge shirley temple fan . when i saw this movie , it made me appreciate what a talented child shirley actually was . ashley rose orr made possibly the worst on-screen shirley . imagine an 11 year old playing shirley temple from the age of 5 . that in itself is wrong . but getting her to ' mimick ' shirley ' s voice ? and her singing is woeful . the dancing was good , i ' ll say that . as previous users have said , there was little dramatic scenes , nothing to make the story interesting . not even amelia earhart . . . i would have liked to have seen more of the world wide phenomenon that shirley temple created . there was too much focus on the wizard of oz , when in reality , shirley was just considered for dorothy . the film portrays it as though it is the end of the world when she does not get the role . shirley herself said that she is glad judy garland got to play her . for me the star of the show was the lady who played gertrude temple . otherwise , stay away ! for great shirley temple films , watch heidi , poor little rich girl and little miss broadway .  a sprawling , overambitious , plotless comedy that has no dramatic center . it was probably intended to have an epic vision and a surrealistic flair ( at least in some episodes ) , but the separate stories are never elevated into a meaningful whole , and the laughs are few and far between . amusing ending , though . ( * 1 / 2 )  alfred hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of : he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him . 

the main subject of this bullock vehicle , all the ideas , almost everything was already in hitchcock ' s classic " rope " : the two students who commit a gratuitous crime , nietsche ' s philosophy , and the clues that the boys disseminate , the master was the first to transfer them to the screen . and with an eighty-minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force . 

 " murder by numbers " does not take place in a single room , like " the rope " , mind you . and , what a supreme originality , it pits two cops against the evil youngsters ; and , you would never guess it , these two cops are very different : actually , bullock plays the part of woman living like a man , and her partner ( chaplin ) is as shy as a clueless girlie . the two boys ' performances are not really mind-boggling , not as good , as , say , that of edward norton in " primal fear " . 

well , you know , " rope " was so good . . . .  g & m started a the odd couple downstairs in man about the house and went on to amusing the nation in their own sitcom . 

what was the typical small-scale personal charm of the couples chemistry on the small screen , g & m ' s transferral to the big screen was as appalling as genuis ' s morcombe and wise , and countless fine tv shows . 

unfunny . unsatisfying and featuring an ill yootha joyce who died before the film was released .   " caligula " shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 " fellini satyricon " with bizarre sights , freakishness , and depictions of sexual excesses all set in the " glory " of ancient rome . but fellini it ain ' t . . . first of all it is not as entertaining . far too much screen time is devoted to bug-eyed , rubber-faced mcdowell in the titular role . his performance is far too fey and campy to be convincing . the portrayals by jay robinson in " the robe " ( 1953 ) and david cain-haughton in " emperor caligula " ( 1983 ) are far more persuasive and believable , with the latter being the most nuanced . relief could have been judiciously provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully . as it is , they are little more than cyphers . one example is the role of macro , played by guido mannari who has tremendous screen presence in an important role , but is mostly left in the background . the only positive features to credit are the adroit use of some prokofiev and stravinsky themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the distasteful but nevertheless accurate actions of the despot . these two factors are far less than what is needed to relieve the prevailing tedium , however .  olivier assayas ' film stars asia argento as a woman who had a relationship with michael madsen . madsen is a business man who ' s in financial trouble . in desperation he is going to sell his share of a business to a company called golden eagle , a company from the far east . as madsen begins his moves away from his company asia argento returns to his life . the pair had a torrid love affair that included her doing business favors for madsen ( with said golden eagle ) . once argento enters the film the film follows her as we see the tangled web she ' s woven and how the complications spin dangerously and violently out of control . 

i ' m not a fan . actually i was quite bored as the film seems to go from pillar to post for much of the first hour during which i kept wondering what the point was other than to provide a meaty role for argento . argento , daughter of director dario argento and a director in her own right , is a unique actress . at times stunningly good , she is more often then not going to give you a quirky off beat portrayal of a damaged human being . sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ' t . i don ' t think it completely works here mostly because the script is too " complicated " to support it . i didn ' t care what was going on so her wounded girl just rubbed me the wrong way ( she seemed more nut job than anything else ) . i ' m not blaming the actors but writer / director assayas who has once again constructed a complicated tale with the sort of parts actors love to tackle , but which leave audiences scratching their heads because they they don ' t really work . 

if you must try it on cable this movie serves up every imaginable greek stereotype . in one particularly galling scene the tycoon says " i ' m just an ignorant peasant . " as the grandson of greek peasant immigrants who passed on a legacy of wisdom and love to their children and grandchildren , i found this movie contemptible and odious .  the abc gears up it ' s repertory company for another unrealistic representation of rural australia . yes folks , it ' s all there baca bourke ( jeremy sims , an actor of little talent ) fire hero , lill ( libby tanner plays bronwyn craig in the bush ) , fifi ( nadia townsend ) town slut , preggers by baca ' s brother joe ( i think ) . then there ' s uncle geoff the , big daddy of lost springs . uncle geoff ' s scenes are like tennessee williams on speed . only saving grace is russian actress natalia novikova as baca ' s loony missus . she is great . i can ' t understand why john waters took the gig as lilly ' s psychologist husband . must have needed the money i expect ! still , he won ' t last long as lill and baca will be having it off toute suit . just watch this lemon to see how bad an aussie show can be . frankly , i ' m ashamed .  i remember watching this mini-series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation . having read the comments on this title , i must agree with those from the people in greece . this was produced to coincide with the 1984 los angeles olympic games and , to me , it seemed like nothing more than an exercise in jingoistic , flag-waving american nationalism in which the american athletes are glorified at everyone else ' s expense . some other nationalities would have every right to feel deeply insulted at the way they were portrayed in this series . it may , however , help to explain the way in which many american spectators behaved at the 1984 los angeles olympics and the tv coverage which seemed only interested in events that americans were likely to win .  this is a standard action flick as we have seen them many times before . not much action in this one though . again it ' s about the guy protecting the president . he ' s macho - as usual , and at the same time soft and melancholic - as usual . does he have the guts to take a bullet for the president ? ! and then there ' s the girl and the usual conservative flirting around . stereotypical and predictable to the last toe-crumbling minute .  two page boys working at a radio network go from trying to solve murders to performing in black-face in between work shifts . jack moran and sidney miller star in this whodunnit from 1945 . lots of fast talking , everybody yells at everybody , and the two page boys call the police detective " marty " ( played by ralph sanford ) . it ' s a real " shortie " at 59 minutes , and it has the feel of being adapted from a play , since it mostly takes place in a radio station soundstage . we don ' t really care about any of the characters , which is probably why its hardly ever shown . no big deal . this was phil karlson ' s second film as director . we ' re not given any clues as to who might be knocking people off , so we just kind of follow the police detective and the page boys as they all try to solve the mystery first . i ' ll say no more so as not to give away any spoilers .  john madden ' s cinematic interpretation of edith wharton ' s ethan frome falls short of doing justice to a great literary piece . while the story is maintained the elements that give the novella its soul are skewered and all in all lost in the film . madden fails to convey the innocence , and overall tragedy of ethan and mattie ' s relationship instead transforming it into a morality tale . the mark is missed and the point lost in added details and poor dialog . zeena ( zenobia ) in the book is almost completely the antagonist , the books least sympathetic figure , where in the movie she can be almost pitied though it ' s a stretch you kind of feel bad for this sick woman who is being cheated on . the book more accurately describes zeena ' s tyrannical control of the house and of ethan . the movie just ticked me off . the addition of the fox was pointless , as well as the scene with mattie trying to kill herself . it was just poorly interpreted and done . film mistakes : ethan ' s elusiveness in the church dance scene , interactions with denis eady , addition of love scene , fox scene , store scene , saying his plans allowed , lack of displays of ethan ' s inner emotions and thoughts , introduction of the priest instead of nameless engineer , let on to much that zeena knows about the growing relationship where in novel reader never knows what zeena is thinking or aware of . just too many flaws and poor directing decisions .   " black vengeance " is an alternate title for " ying hung ho hon " aka " tragic hero " ( 1987 ) . i have just seen this on vhs , together with the first part of the story , " gong woo ching " ( " rich and famous " ) , also 1987 . ( the poster and 2 stills featured on the page are for a 4-dvd set of movies starring rod perry ( the black gestapo ) , fred williamson ( black cobra 2 ) , richard lawson ( black fist ) . the fourth movie is called " the black six " ) . strangely , while the characters retain their original names in " rich and famous " , in " black vengeance " chow yun-fat ' s character is named eddie shaw , alex man ( man tze leung ) is harry , and andy lau is called johnny . also confusing is the fact that 1994 is given as the copyright dates on both films . perhaps that was the year they were american-dubbed . according to the release dates given on imdb " tragic hero " was released before " rich and famous " . was there any reason for releasing the sequel first ? despite some users ' comments , i enjoyed these films , although they aren ' t among cyf ' s best such as " the killer " and " hard-boiled " which are truly astonishing . however , if one day i come across a 2-dvd set of " rich and famous " and " tragic hero " i won ' t hesitate to buy it . hopefully , these comments about " black vengeance " clear up , which was also for me , a mystery as to where it belonged in chow yun-fat ' s filmography .  the 1998 version of " psycho " needed to be set back in the 60 ' s , rather than present day . the headliners would have done a good job with the setting . there were two scenes that just stuck out like a sore thumb . the first one was at the beginning of the movie when marian crane ( anne heche ) was sitting at her desk . her boss took his client into his office because " it was air conditioning . " i imagine that the majority of arizona businesses have air conditioning . the other was the meeting of lila crane ( julianne moore ) & sam loomis ( viggo mortensen ) . lila sporting the walkman seemed like an exaggeration to update the movie . the movie did spook a number of the viewers in the theater .  here is a film which clearly banks on being marketed as exotica to audiences unfamiliar with its subject matter . 

an attempted hybrid of fiction and document , " kadosh " clumsily falls in between the chairs . as a documentary , on the one hand , it is neither accurate nor insightful . to realize its sloppy handling of detail , one needs to go no further than the opening scene where it is quite obvious that the ultra-orthodox protagonist does not know even so much as how to properly put on his t ' filin . more generally , the tedious rote-style presentation of details ( in this case of jewish ultra-orthodox ritual ) is the role of a manual , not of a good documentary ; the latter should provide an organizing principle ( a gestalt , if you will ) for the viewer , so that she may emerge with a better understanding of the viewed . this clearly does not happen here , as ultra-orthodox ritual is being made even more enigmatic . the director seems to have done a decent job explaining it all verbally during the film ' s release campaign ; cinematically , however , this is a severe case of stuttering . as a fiction-feature , on the other hand , it suffers from flatness of character , simplicity of plot and bluntness of message . at some points i felt i was watching a cartoon . ( e . g . the wedding night consummation scene - without going in detail into angles , positions and dimensions . . . well , technically this could not possibly be a realistic portrayal of human sex , savage as it may be . ) 

there are no subtleties in this film . the clever manipulation of hints , stimulating the viewer ' s imagination and thought into taking an active part in the cinematic text , which i believe is a mark of a good feature , is completely absent . on the contrary : watching the movie i felt , at times , as being force-fed again and again with the same already chewed-up and way-too-obvious content . it is , indeed , as director gitai himself put it in an interview , an architectural " shifting objects in space " , and then coloring the scenes with the appropriate emotions when called for and advancing the plot on its appropriate and predictable track ; but the spark , that creative , duende-like dark , inarticulable spark ( let ' s not forget " kadosh " is supposedly a tragedy ) , that which casts on a two-dimensional screen the spell which turns it into an extension of the viewers world , is missing without a trace . perhaps a work of a visual-engineer , perhaps of an unsophisticated ideologue ; definitely not of a true filmmaker . what i saw was a passion-play for animated issues rather than flesh-blood-and-complexities real people . the acting , by and large , failed to transcend this directorial flatness of an idea forced ( at times even tortured ) into film . one notable , though relatively minor , exception was that of the mikve-lady and the mother , both played by the excellent and seasoned lea koenig . 

it takes more than strict adherence to a winning formula ( namely , a serving of exotica , plus heart wrenching yet simple melodrama , plus a popular agenda , preferably politically correct ) to tantalize my interest buds . the bottom line here , all being said , is that for a considerable portion of the movie i was simply bored . in spite of the novel , perhaps even pioneering achievement of using an ultra-orthodox neighborhood as a movie set , for which mr . gitai and his crew deserve all praise , i found " kadosh " way too nadosh ( hebrew for " trite " ) .  river queen attempts to pack a complicated , sweeping , historical narrative into just under two hours . there are some breathtaking battle scenes and the wanganui scenery is beautifully captured . however , the film did suffer from some poor leads - samantha morton ( sarah ) especially came across as unconvincing . there seemed to be an indecisiveness about how the role should be played - as a helpless waif tossed by fate or as a strong , determined character with a clear view of her destiny . kiefer sutherland ' s character - private doyle - seemed to be pointless and for the most part - unintelligible . keifer ' s irish brogue needs a little polishing . on the other hand , cliff curtis , temuera morrison and rawiri pene ( as sarah ' s son " boy " ) were well rounded and believable . 

the last 20 minutes of river queen came across as particularly compressed and rushed . it seemed as if they decided they had to tie up all the loose ends before 120 minutes were up . e . g . how on earth did wiremu know how to find sarah and doyle ? no explanation and very unsatisfying . 

i did go to this movie with an open mind . i hadn ' t read or heard anything much apart from its troubled production . what i experienced was a mish mash of new zealand history , beautifully photographed but ultimately disappointing .  this well-meant film falls just a bit short , and unfortunately in too many areas . 

the scenery is gorgeous , with vistas of north-central vermont providing the setting for this mid-century tale . quebec bill endeavors to go back to his whiskey-running past in order to save his farm . 

going back and forth between scenes of magical realism and straight-forward action , this film rarely hits its stride . 

kris kristofferson as quebec bill seems pretty stilted , or else it ' s his lines ; or else his cross of yankee and quebecois accents . anyway , he just comes off as a low-key blow-hard . his dialogs with gary farmer ' s coville character do sparkle , though . william sanderson ' s rat kinneson is solid . charlie mcdermott shows some real potential as young wild bill ; but his part ' s not large enough to carry a scene and he never steals one . luis guzman shows up on lake memphramagog ( with a fine stand-in performance by lake willoughby ) as a monk with a boys ' n ' the hood accent : who knows ? and then there ' s bujold ' s cordelia : an oracle like her namesake , she channels yoda as she intones lines like " you will marry a quebec woman ! " ? ! ? just too weird and nowhere near enigmatic enough . 

the end gets really choppy . again a bad mix of magical realism and the concrete . and yoda never provides an answer we can understand .  this is said to be the first polish western and is written and directed by piotr uklanski . known in the u . s . as dead man ' s bounty , this film uses some strange visuals to tell a story that is short on dialog . val kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes . some awkward visual situations are actually comical in a sick way . my favorite is a young man building a gallows chops off one of his own fingers and actually hangs himself testing the strength of the rope . a cowboy known only as ' the stranger ' ( karel roden ) finds a dead man ( kilmer ) that he thinks is a wanted man . he takes him to the nearest town to collect the bounty . he ends up losing the corpse and the potential bounty in a gambling game with the town ' s drunken sheriff ( boguslaw linda ) and has the few townsmen turned against him when he has a dalliance with the barmaid ( katarzyna figura ) . he manages to escape sure death and leads the small posse on a dangerous ' wild goose chase ' . one scene has the stranger tending to a scalp wound by cauterizing with gunpowder and a match . the corpse rots chained to a hitching post as the sheriff finds out that there is no bounty to be had . this movie also known as summer love has a haunting theme song sung by john davidson . nevertheless this western is like watching a train wreck . there is just something that tells you not to look . . . but you do .  well , this latest version of mansfield park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version ( outright copied some of the ideas from it in fact ) , but tone things down a bit to bring it more in line with the original story . unfortunately , the result is a rather lackluster , and schizophrenic , production . and , as with all the other versions of mansfield park out there , the character of fanny price is no where to be found . instead there is a strangely child-like , bleached-blond woman running around who never really fully develops as a character . at least in the 1999 movie the character they call " fanny price " is firmly established as rebellious tomboy who is too clever for her own good . this " fanny price " is a complete enigma . someday , i would really like to see a dramatization of mansfield park that actually includes a depiction of the character of fanny as she was written by jane austen . a sweet , kind , compassionate girl with a timid personality and frail constitution . she is reserved in manner and painfully honest , but also strong in her convictions , unfailingly loyal , extremely intelligent , and remarkably astute . a bit of a late bloomer , it is not until her eighteenth year that she finally begins to make the transition from awkward adolescent to self-possessed young woman . and she wants nothing more in life than to be of some real use to those she loves most . it ' s a wonderfully complex character that i look forward to one day seeing faithfully portrayed .  linda arvidson ( as jennie ) and harry solter ( as frank ) are enjoying a romantic tryst , when in walks her father charles inslee ; furious , he chases mr . solter out of the house . undaunted , he goes to her balcony and begs her to elope . ms . arvidson is agreeable , and goes to pack . then , burglar george gebhardt arrives to rob the place . though he doesn ' t get much in the way of booty , thieving gebhardt manages to use arvidson ' s trunk to escape from the police 

a contrived comedy . note , during the balcony scene , solter goes off-camera , so burglar gebhardt can enter the house undetected . and , arvidson travels very light , since there appears to be nothing in her heavy trunk ; perhaps she just wanted to buff up beau solter ? director d . w . griffith , robert harron , and florence lawrence are illustrious extras . 

 * * a calamitous elopement ( 8 / 7 / 08 ) d . w . griffith ~ george gebhardt , linda arvidson , harry solter if you haven ' t read tolkien ' s masterpiece ; prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever ! if you have however . . . after having read the books several times , over many years , i have come to love the characters and story , and feel i know it intimately . i have my own personal vision of the shire , hobbiton and the character-gallery . thus for me the movie was a disappointment . why ? it dictates the appearance of the characters ( unavoidably ) , it changes events , it removes important storyline , it removes not-so-important storyline . great chunks of what makes the lord of the rings what it is , is simply ignored . even 2001 special effects can ' t do tolkien ' s ( and your own ) imagination justice . peter jackson has made an honest attempt at the impossible , and i don ' t think anyone else could have done it better ! but the fact remains , i regret seeing the movie . the next time i read the lord of the rings , peter jackson ' s limited vision will leap forward , not my own .  when the word " presents " finds its way into a title , preceded by a famous name , the work is usually immediately dismissible . for some reason , people who are capable of creating good art don ' t seem to be able to see it in others . however , i ' ve always been willing to give the second installment of the demons trilogy a try . for one thing , the soundtracks are absolutely to die for . most american directors would have sacrificed small animals to line up the kind of talent on the soundtrack of demons 2 . for another , well , two words : asia argento . ( of course , she was eleven when this film was made , and a number of years away from her seeming decision that she would style her acting after early helen mirren : steamy looks and little clothing . ) as well , lamberto bava comes from one of italy ' s finest dynasties in that odd horror sub genre known as giallo ( he ' s the son of mario bava , who may well have invented the genre in the sixties ) . and the original demons is an absolute must-see for fans of eighties b-horror films . so how bad can this be , right ? well , bad . the demons continue their assault on italian media , as the movie opens in a modern italian high-rise where many people going about their lives have their televisions on in the background . they ' re all watching a kind of combination news report / mater video of some investigative reporter types trying to get proof of the events of the first film ( which would seem to put the time frame of this one no more than a few days after the first film ) . through the usual horror-film extra inability to concentrate , the reporters manage to bring a demon back to life , and he comes through the tv screen to start the plague anew . 

yeah . it ' s that bad . about the only thing good one can say about the film is that the soundtrack ( when you ' re not being buffeted about by the likes of the smiths , the cult , gene loves jezebel , etc . ) is stunning . it comes from the keyboard of simon boswell , who got his start as a part of the argento dynasty and has since gone on to score such films as lord of illusions and hackers . 

makes a half-decent free rental if you ' re planning on drinking heavily , but it ' s certainly nowhere near the fun the original was . cronenberg ' s wonderfully funny high-rise-nasty-creature romp , shivers ( aka they came from within ) , is a whole lot better .  three young movie theater employees are given the task of re-opening a long closed old-time theater at which many years before a shocking series of grisly murders took place . it seems many more murders have occurred since then but all of this remains unknown to these three young upstart employees hoping to finally make it big on their own . as they approach the grand re-opening night , things keep getting stranger and more unsettling with items suddenly starting to move around by themselves without any seen aid and a terrifying old man seemingly haunting the premises . 

oh , this is truly horrible . in fact , if it wasn ' t for mary woronov ' s secretary character being such a fiercely independent outspoken empowered young woman who steals practically every scene in which she appears and the incredibly hot chick who played the unbelievably sleazy yet totally sexy selina , this would be a total loss . the only other good thing i have to say about this film is some of the movie theater murders are done in truly inventive , albeit not overly gory ( a preference for me but not necessarily for others ) , fashion . the rest just wallows in constant sleaze ( so extreme the rare few may actually find humor in it ) and runs through the predictable slasher kills annoying characters off one after the other routine .  strained and humorless ( especially in light of its rather dubious psychology ) , but well-paced and comfortably lurid , this genteel body count movie highlights the unusually hypnotic presence of angharad rees as a young woman periodically possessed by jack the ripper , thus allowing for some nasty gore effects amidst the edwardian propriety . it ' s all pretty standard stuff for hammer , but is handled with a good deal of visual elan , even if the central relationship , between psychoanalyst porter and rees , drives the narrative without ever being satisfactorily explained .  this is one of the best looking films of the past few years . the fact that it was done on a virtual shoestring ( $ 1 . 8 million or so they say on the dvd : they infer that they ended up with even less financing ) makes it all the more impressive . not simply the photography , but the design and particularly the locations ( eastern montana ) which are at once authentically american and otherworldly . 

too bad there isn ' t a coherent movie to go with it . an extremely promising setup of the last 48 hours of clearing out a rural town in 1955 before it will be flooded for a dam is washed away with pretentious mumbo jumbo alluding to angels and a dying child . and what is presented as the " real world " is hopelessly arch . note to the polish brothers : the coen brothers are funny-you are not . 

no doubt many cineastes will find " northfork " ' s abundant symbolism and inscrutability as marks of some sort of profundity , the sort that sophisticated types wrestle the night away with in coffeehouses while the braindead masses watch " charlie ' s angels " or something . ( sigh ) if you insist . . . . 

in the meantime , recommended only as a case study for filmmakers for its ' impeccable technical credits and photographic beauty .  jonathan demme is such a character-oriented director that , to see him pulling a brian de palma ( which is to say , aping hitchcock ) , it is nearly predictable when he fails to work up much suspense within this tepid mystery . working from a screenplay by david shaber , from murray teigh bloom ' s novel , demme attempts to strike a chord somewhere between alan j . pakula ' s paranoia dramas and hitchcock ' s dangling-participle thrillers . roy scheider stars as a retired secret agent mourning the murder of his wife who is now busy dodging bad guys who are out to kill him . takes off right away , but the script is full of flimsy threads and any excitement dies out quickly . there ' s a visually impressive climax at niagra falls , but demme gets little out of his cast , and even less out of this bummer of a story . * * from * * * *  irwin allen ' s first venture into all star spectacle was one all star disaster . the story of mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time . virginia mayo as the blond cleopatra , dennis hopper chewing the scenery with napoleon , peter lorre dining on the scenery for weeks as nero , marie wilson as marie antoinette as a roadshow marilyn monroe , that ' s just some of them . 

the film also is known for being the last film which featured all three of the marx brothers though they all have different roles . chico plays a monk who is christopher columbus ' s confidante , groucho euchres the indians out of manhattan island as peter minuit , and most astonishing of all , harpo marx as sir isaac newton who discovers gravity when an apple conks him on the bean . 

holding all these portrayals together is a story where mankind itself is being judged . a super h bomb is about to be discovered and let loose will do in the world ' s population . it ' s judgement day a coming . 

but mankind has its advocates and detractors . speaking for the prosecution is old scratch who ' s been bringing the worst out in man for centuries in the form of vincent price . but man has his good side as well and who better than ronald colman to demonstrate man at his most civilized best . colman and price plead their case before the judge played by cedric hardwicke . 

in those three individuals you have some of the finest speaking voices the english language ever knew . when the film is on them as they each bring out the exhibits for their case it ' s a pleasure to listen to . then when the focus is on the individual stories , you want to scream in agony . 

what was irwin allen driving at , i ' m still trying to figure it out . was he deliberately camping it up with some of these casting decisions ? if it was satire , it just doesn ' t get off the ground . 

this was ronald colman ' s farewell film and while it ' s hardly something i ' d like to go out on , i can ' t think of any man who could have stated the case for civilization any better . 

so when you see the story of mankind , fast forward through some of the exhibits and treasure every moment the advocates are before the judge .  i ' ll never understand why when a studio like universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it to screen . my first thought when seeing ava gardner and robert walker were starring i would be seeing something from mgm which did musicals best at that time . boy was i wrong and disappointed . 

one touch of venus which starred mary martin , kenny baker , and john boles on broadway ran for 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season and gardner , walker , and tom conway play the roles that martin , baker , and boles did on stage . the kurt weill-ogden nash musical with book by nash and s . j . perelman was a comeback vehicle for mary martin who reestablished herself as the queen of broadway after a disappointing venture in hollywood . 

look at the names that went into this show . given who was responsible for the book i expected to see some sparkling wit in this production . instead i got a rather pedestrian screenplay , it was like all the wit was drained out of it . doing her best to make up for it is eve arden playing her usual girl friday role with tom conway , but it ' s even too much for eve . 

the story concerns department store window dresser robert walker who kisses a very valuable statue of venus who springs to life in the person of ava gardner . of course when the statue goes missing , conway yells for the law and is suspicious of walker , the last person to be with the statue . 

the rest of the film is walker dealing with gardner and what will happen to both of them . for reasons i don ' t understand , ava was of course dubbed by eileen wilson and walker sings only a couple of lines . the singing is carried by dick haymes and olga san juan playing walker ' s friends and coworkers . of course on broadway the songs were done by singers mary martin and kenny baker . you would kind of think that haymes would be playing walker ' s role at least . it was awkward to say the least . 

only three songs survived from the score , don ' t look now , but my heart is showing , that ' s him , and the incomparable speak low . haymes ' s silken baritone is shown to best advantage in speak low which was sung as a duet by martin and baker on broadway . for some reason the lyrics of one of the greatest men of verse of the last century , ogden nash , were done over by ann ronnell . i suspect the infamous code was at work here . 

in lee server ' s biography of ava gardner he makes mention of a brief fling ava had with robert walker when she had had a spat with her current man , howard duff . when duff and gardner reunited , walker took it badly and didn ' t speak at all to gardner off camera . i ' m sure the fact that both of them were not in their best work didn ' t help matters either . 

hopefully some repertoire company will do one touch of venus and you ' ll get to see it the way , weill , nash , and perelman wrote it .  this review is for the uk dvd three-disc box set . disc one is called caught in the act and contains model behavior , chasing jamie and fast and curious . disc two is called bedroom fantasies and contains blue plate special , falling in lust again and love potion no . 10 . the final disc is called anything goes and contains chatroom , she ' s the boss and legally yours . why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material . 

each episode opens with the hotel manager chloe ( lauren hayes ) reading a letter from a satisfied customer . we then get to see the story unfolding as the guests check into the hotel . blue plate special is the exception because this story is from a waitress . the writers should be given credit for coming up with a good variety of story lines . for instance , model behavior is about two models vying for the attention of the photo crew ; falling in lust again is about a man and woman who parted and rekindle their love when they meet up again at the hotel ; she ' s the boss is about a put-upon male secretary / dogsbody who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realised - much to her pleasure . all the episodes lead up to lots of nudity and sex . 

it should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome hunks . even the geeky secretaries get transformed when they remove their spectacles and let their hair down . the sex action is plentiful but to me seems too frantic and false . the camera work could also have done with a bit of moderation , spending too much time close up and so moving about to capture everything , and as usual we get loud music during the sex action . finally , the end credits mention the palm canopy hotel , singer island , florida although my map of florida shows no singer island . the scenery certainly looks more like florida than utah or las vegas that some people have mentioned . this is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a uk dvd release . 4 stars .  heftig og begeistret ( intense and enthusiastic ) is a documentary-like story of a male choir up in berlevÃ¥g in the very northern part of norway , where the weather is cold and hostile , the days are dark during the winter and the towns are faced with young people moving to the more populated parts in the south of norway , where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities . 

the most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves . the people in the choir , who are aged from 30 to 95 , all have unique , colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings . they are characterised by the harsh climate and the recession of the north and have adapted to the way of living required . throughout the movie , we learn a bit about many people in the choir and we follow them through songs , some events in a church and on the harbour , and in the end , a trip to murmansk . 

the outside environment filmed in the movie is very beautiful and characterised by the norwegian nature . the scenography is also natural and taken directly from the choir and from the peoples lives that we meet . thei r livingrooms , the bathroom , the kettle on the oven ; there is nothing artificial about this movie , not the people , not the environment , not their music and not their feelings . everything is as real as can be . 

it all loses out though when it comes to giving a story . it is very beautiful and real , but why do we see it ? is it because of the songs ? is it because of the nature ? or is it simply just to see a story about berlevÃ¥g mens-choir , about their life and some of the trips they have . the message , if there is any , is that this small society copes with life through such social events like the choir . the choir have kept the people together for many many years . 

it is all nice , but being as popular as it has been , seen by almost 200 . 000 in norway , there is something wrong . there is no beginning or end to it . nobody gains or loses anything , nobody reveals any message or tries to convince the audience of that this is good or that life up there is great . why was this movie made ? 

i am sorry . it is a nice movie about good people , but compared to the average european , scandinavian or norwegian movie - this does not deserve a 9 out of 10 . it is closer to 4 out of 10 , and that is what i will give it . 

if you see this movie in a theater , you should expect the average age on the audience to be around 55-60 . it has reported to be consistently high in all theaters . maybe this is also the reason for it receiving such very high praise in the news and good grades also on the imdb : it is a movie about elders , for elders . it is a movie of " i regret nothing in my life " , and a story saying that living in a small town like berlevÃ¥g , might be a nice life too .  for those of us who are part of the real world of ballet - this film is completely ridiculous . ivan kirov was basically a gymnast , not a ballet dancer . viola essen at the time was with ballet theater , now american ballet theater , and a reasonably good dancer , but except for dame judith anderson , the acting is amateurish and checkov is completely over the top . . . . embarrassingly so ! i saw this film at age 14 and at that time , never having seen a ballet , i was very impressed . however , later in life , long after i had completed my own career as a dancer - i purchased the video tape of it , curious as to what it was like after so many years . i couldn ' t believe how naive hollywood could be about the world of ballet . but it was made in the mid 40s , before the red shoes or the turning point , the latter giving a true picture of the ballet world . the entire cast of spectre have now passed away . . . ivan kirov ( not his real name ) dying at age 79 . it was his one and only film , thereafter being kept by a chicago business man . . so the rumor goes .  i really liked the idea of traveling between dimensions , and i even liked the wade / quinn tension in early episodes . some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extremely interesting backdrops for their stories . however , as the show went on there were more silly disputes among the friends and less of a true bond . there was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension . and every world had one of the characters falling in love . the writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top . too bad it would ' ve been nice to have a closely knit band of friends ( a la star wars ) traveling to different dimensions on tv for several years , rather than a tired band of knit pickers .  we ' re in a not so distant future , globalization seems to have reached a high point , languages mixes with each other ( although english prevails over the rest ) , races have merged , human clonation is a fact , and all the territory seems to have been divided in two zones : the one for the valid and the one for the non-valid . . . a brave new world ( in aldous huxley ' s style ) in which people are genetically filed and blood relationships are strictly forbidden ( for health reasons Âthat ' s the code 46 of the title- ) . in such environment two souls that are destined not to meet fall in love with each other . 

winterbottom had an important story , with quite a big potential . a nice recipe that he ruins giving it a so slow rhythm , narrating it in a so weary way , removing any emotions . . . coldness , that ' s all code 46 transmits . coldness and boredom . not even the presence of samantha morton and tim robbins ( both of ' em play their roles wonderfully ) , nor the visual and sound power of some sequences can do anything to save the movie . what a pity . 

code 46 : what could have been and never was . 

 * my rate : 4 / 10 let me state this right from the start . i do not hate this show . i actually quite like some aspects of it . in fact , when i first started to watch it , i quickly became hooked . i was just starting to come out of the whole " anime is for kids " stereotype , and the mature elements of the show had me intrigued . 

unfortunately , after seeing the whole series through and a few of the films , i can say that my overall disposition has changed , and it falls into almost all of the pitfalls that plague " bad " anime . seven or eight friends and myself started watching this series on tv . by the end , only one friend and i were still watching and neither of us liked it . 

allow me to explain the plot for you . you can skip this paragraph if you don ' t want to know . kagome is an average high school student , who one day falls into a magical well near her family run shrine . when kagome comes out of the well again , she has been transported back in time to the feudal era of japan . she meets up with many other characters and they form a group of five or so companions who set off on a journey of revenge / justice / groping in one characters case = ) . overall , they are trying to recover the pieces of the sacred jewel shard which enhances the power of demons who use it . 

while there are many , many side stories and story arcs , there is no were near enough material to occupy 167 episodes . the only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull ( the band of seven ) . after the half way mark in the series or maybe even before , it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes . 

these episodes have little to no impact on the story , and rarely even on the characters . in some cases , some characters who had an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time . many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it . inuyasha shoots wind-scar at enemy . windscar deflects . characters gasp in horror . enemy turns out to have barrier . characters spent three episodes trying to kill enemy before kagome finally fires sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust . 

also * * major spoiler : the conclusion will be revealed * * the lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you have waisted 83 hours . 

 * * major spoiler over * * 

the animation itself is above average , and in some cases excellent . even so , reused animation cells plague most action scenes , and it is very hard to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same boulder has flown past a character five or six times in a row . 

on the brighter side however , all of the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating . also , the character designs ( appearences ) were brilliant and at times among the best i have seen , particularly with the band of seven . there is definitely no shortage of cosplay opportunities here . even so , i found myself hoping that a character would die just so there would be some sort of movement in the plot . and some of the humour in the show between characters is used again and again . one particular joke ( sit boy ) is found within the first five episodes , and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining 162 episodes . 

although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has a huge following , the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls who drool over sesshomiru and inuyasha . 

bottom line : definitely worth checking out , but not worth watching the whole series . the first 30 episodes are very clever , original and enjoyable for anybody . but after that , it simply becomes dull and tedious . watching a tv show should never feel like a chore , but somehow this series accomplishes just that . don ' t expect much from " inuyasha " , because you will only feel let down .  well , " built " doris day ( as ethel s . " dynamite " jackson ) is mistaken for thespian ethel barrymore , and falls in love with dancer ray bolger ( as s . " sam " winthrop putnam ) . older frenchman claude dauphin ( as philippe fouquet ) also digs doris . honestly what were they thinking ? - this wildly inappropriate musical does feature ms . day prettily singing the standard " april in paris " , and others . certainly , there nothing as good as her columbia recordings from the time ; and , nothing approaches day ' s stunning and forthcoming " secret love " . although the material does not serve him well , it ' s nice to see mr . bolger performing . some of the musical numbers are obnoxious . 

 * * * * april in paris ( 12 / 24 / 52 ) david butler ~ doris day , ray bolger , claude dauphin this version is very painful to watch . all of the acting is very stilted but especially that of norma shearer who is still acting as though she were in a silent movie instead of a talkie . check out the 1937 version with joan crawford , robert montgomery and william powell which is much more entertaining .  i saw the movie in original italian . it must be said that the acting and interpretation is most heavily polluted by the tv-generated trend to speak in a severely muffled voice , not moving lips , straining tones , as emerged in the " that ' s real life " -productions and " let ' s-raise-our audience-with-a-few-tears " -screen-playwriting . the late massimo girotti towers upon the other characters for intensity , clarity of expression and intellectual honesty . the movie has some good hints , but ( as in another comment before mine ) it lacks a focal point and dribbles away in many plot-lets of lesser and lesser relevance , another trend dragged in from the tv productions , well known to italians . a few drops in style could be spared to the public , such as the patisserie drag ( charm and aesthetics of cooking plus sensual payload of sweets , see chocolat , babette ' s lunch , vatel etc . ) hammam and the fairies are definitely more truthful , seems that ozpetek has learned the tune of italy in the early 2000s and is humming along . . . i ' ll give him a last chance though . . .  as the title suggests there is a philosophical , meritocratic thread running through this film : if a man has the talent and looks to find his way into society and money what might be the outcome if he is denied it for failing to have the x factor ? this question is unsatisfactorily dealt with in this adaptation of patricia highsmith ' s book and left me rather cold along the way . 

matt damon is the ripley of the title and apart from blagging his way on a funded jaunt to europe falls under the spell of his commissioned target , dickie greenleaf ( law ) . homoeroticism and social insecurity get all tangled up in a violent conflagration which escalated and complicate themselves for the rest of the movie . law , damon and the damningly pleasant paltrow as dickie ' s girlfriend are ok . i liked philip seymour hoffman ' s cameo-ish freddie miles , the bluff society friend that ripley can never be . the problem is that the story is lumpen without arc - or redemption , for that matter - which makes it rather difficult to swallow . 4 / 10 this is one of those " family " movies that i can ' t imagine having much appeal to anyone over about 9 . a group of siblings discovers a " sand fairy " ( yes , really ) conveniently located at the end of a not-so-secret passage at the country home of their eccentric uncle , to which they ' ve been evacuated from the london blitz . . . . and there you have it , all in one sentence . the story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger of getting wishes fulfilled , but neither of these issues is examined in a way that would be interesting to adults or instructive to children ( or vice versa ! ) . the only reason i can think of for watching this is to see how starkly freddie highmore ' s outstanding talent stands out from the rest of the mediocre performances .  empty shortening of john irving ' s novel strives for profundity courageously but ends up being absurd . it ' s a quirky , goofy and bittersweet string of sketches , attempting to explain a man ' s growth from birth to adulthood and how he deals with the vices of lust and fanaticism that surround him . garp is born to a formidable unmarried mother , jenny fields , played by glenn close . ( the various stages of garp ' s childhood are played by three young actors before robin williams takes over as garp reaches adulthood . ) the story follows him through childhood at a boys ' prep school , where jenny is the school nurse , through his high school passions-wrestling , writing , and sex-to marriage with his high school sweetheart , children , marital problems and a writing career . jenny meanwhile has become a famous feminist , espousing an unorthodox cause . the plot details an abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and outlandish adventures . williams gives a cherub-faced performance . this script was not fitting for his wildness and anarchy and thus his talent was wasted . he ' s like an injured bird sputtering out of control . john lithgow ' s role as a father like transsexual , imparting wisdom , also doesn ' t make sense . this movie was able to attract some reasonable attention in 1982 , due to the popularity of robin williams and his new entry into movies . williams had recently shed his mork and mindy pursuits and focused more on stand-up comedy and movies . audiences were confused by this film , especially by its arbitrary and inexplicable ending .  to some of us , director ernst lubitsch , adored for his underlying cheekiness and ironic comic touches , was rather wet when it came to picking material . it isn ' t that lubitsch is overrated--on the contrary , he probably was ahead of his time in terms of a visual narrative--yet the projects he became attached to ( or was assigned to ) are not quite the landmarks of comedy his fans like to label them . with " heaven can wait " , a screen-adaptation of lazlo bus-fekete ' s play " birthday " , lubitsch is saddled with sleepy don ameche in the lead--and the combination of an anemic plot , a colorless star , and a musty flashback-framework stymies the director . a wicked man at the turn of the century " falls asleep without realizing it " , presenting the facts of his life in front of hell ' s entrance . ameche . . . wicked ? that was problem number one . the promising opening sequence ( set in the hades lobby ) quickly gives way to dreary whimsy , and the supporting cast is of little help . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  dorothy provine does the opposite here : she keeps growing and growing . i didn ' t detect any subtext , though . " the incredible shrinking man " and other movies of its ilk during the period were parables about radiation , nuclear war , and other horrors . provine ' s growth is the result of an inept computer / robot . 

and who operates this computer but lou costello ! i like some of his movies with bud abbott . but , though this is a pretty bad movie , he does fine without him . and gale green is an excellent foil . 

green plays the pompous town big shot . he is provine ' s father . he is intent on being elected mayor . so when his beloved daughter starts having issues , he dumps her . he doesn ' t exactly dump her but gives up his battle against her longtime admirer costello . 

this is pretty implausible : costello is the local garbage collector . 

the special effects are minimal . and the subplot involving the military is lame in the extreme .  yes , this bizarre feature was written by john sayles . shot in toronto , it ' s yet another ' 80s era feature about the dangers of the urban jungle , where the police fear to go and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants . into this mix comes the myth of wild thing , a feral young man raised by a bag lady after his parents were murdered by a dirty cop on the take ( maury chaykin ) and chopper , the local crime lord ( robert davi ) . stir in the local do-gooders ( priest sean hewitt and clueless social worker kathleen quinlan ) , and you have a recipe for some rather unexciting action sequences . davi is the standout amongst the cast , and cinematographer rene verzier does a pretty good job . otherwise this is a rather lumpen action pic that won ' t satisfy action fans and will leaves sayles ' admirers slack-jawed .  viewers of independent films know that once or twice a year they are going to see stories about dysfunctional families and they have come to expect them and it ' s becoming more of a challenge to keep them fresh but here despite the good cast it just seems more of the same . story is about the travis family who is trying to recover from the suicide of matt ( kip pardue ) who was a very promising high school swimmer . ben ( jeff daniels ) is the father who withdraws from everyone and has never treated his other son tim ( emile hirsch ) as well as matt but he does communicate ( of some sort ) to his mother sandy ( sigourney weaver ) who finds his stash of pot and starts to smoke it . 

 * * * * * spoiler alert * * * * * sandy also starts to flirt with much younger men like the check-out cashier at the grocery store but when she attempts to buy more marijuana she gets busted and hauled off to jail . she doesn ' t tell anyone what happened but she does discover bruises on tim ' s body and also that ben has taken a leave of absence from work . after all this happens sandy falls ill and lands in the hospital where her life is in danger which forces ben to realize that he may have to come to terms with losing another part of his family . 

this film is written and directed by dan harris who has worked with bryan singer on " x2 " and also the upcoming superman film and while his script allows these characters to have genuine moments of expressing their pain and confusion the story ( for me ) just has too many things thrown in . the script touches on so many different areas that you need a scorecard to keep track of them all including drugs , sex , love , infidelity , abuse , neglect , experimentation with homosexuality , and a life threatening illness . if all those scenarios weren ' t enough for you harris then tacks on a plot twist at the end that ' s supposed to sum up and explain most of everyone ' s feelings towards tim . while i did roll my eyes at least 2 or 3 times with the way the script kept unrolling one thing after another i must admit that i didn ' t hate this film and i have to credit the actors for that . everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the film but i wish the story would have concentrated more on weaver and her character than hirsch . weaver is exceptional and with a sharper script she could have had a role that maybe would have led to an oscar nomination but instead we get endless scenes of hirsch at parties or his shenanigans with the neighbor next door . harris shows he can be a good writer / director but with this effort he just throws so many different things at the audience that the material just becomes labored and contrived .  the filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript by richard williams bell ( son of john and lucy bell and younger brother of betsy bell ) titled " our family trouble . " to knowledge this is the only eyewitness account ever penned . the filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality . the acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor . it appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line . if you must know the story , read about it , its much more gripping and conclusive .  mr . brento wonders if this movie was produced by the same who produced the dragonball z tv series . of course not . 

this is a hong kong real action movie based on the first episodes of the japanese original cartoon ( which was also based on a comic book series ) . and i really don ' t know if it was produced under the license of the dragonball creators . . . 

however , the story of the monkey-boy with special powers is an ancient tale known all over asia ( in japan , the name of the boy in the tale is songoku ; in china , it is sunwukong ; in korea it is sonogong ; etc ) and the story in dragonball has much to do with that tale . 

by the way , as i said , this movie is based on the first episodes of the dragonball series ( which was followed by dragonball z , although i think the us version had a different airing order ) . and all the scenes related to sexuality were also contained in the original cartoon series ( without so much overacting and so much insistence on it ! ) , but because of your comments i may suppose they were completely removed in the american dubbing . 

anyway , i agree with you about the overacting in the film and about how poor this adaptation of the original cartoon is . but maybe because of that nobody can forget it after watching it . . .  not all films made in 1931 are this creaky , and the fact that this was " best picture " must have given even greater impetus to the development of television . 

typical of all ferber novels , it isn ' t possible to bring the entire story to the screen , to say nothing of developing character . dix -- so stolid in the first third of the movie -- does an about face , but no one knows why and it makes no sense . and what is there about dunne that makes makes her so stoical ? edna may oliver ' s scenes are priceless , as usual . 

this film has a role to play in the history of cinema , but it is long and boring .  this is among one of many usa attempts of remaking a old classic british tv show , that ' s more famous than this one . from what i see none of you haven ' t mentioned or even acknowledged that you knew there was a tv 50 ' s-60 ' s called " secret agent man " the original secret agent man starred the great patrick mcgoohan ( the prisoner , braveheart , ice station zebra , the phantom , etc ) a man who was tapped to be the first james bond , but he turned it down because mcgoohan was a very devout man and he considered james bond ' s bed hopping and violent ways to be against his values . 

this show was done in black and white , and it ' s a pity for those who haven ' t seen it , you are missing out on a lot . the character mr . mcgoohan played in " secret agent man " was named drake , and after he finished with that show he went on to the do the very popular though at times bizarre and controversial tv series called " the prisoner " . the character he played in " the prisoner " was that of a agent who ' s identity is not revealed is kidnapped and transported to a island where he does not know where he is or who it was that is responsible for kidnapping him . what he does know is that his captors want to know the reasons behind his resignation from the british secret service , and on this island the populace don ' t have names but they are referred to by numbers and patricks character is assigned a number which is " 6 " it was argued that his prisoner character was in fact the same character he played in secret agent man but mcgoohan himself disputed this . 

ofourse there is the unmistakable famous theme song that the original secret agent man spawned . it was written by johnny rivers a famous 50 ' s and 60 ' s pop musician and from what i read some of you are actually think that the song comes from this version of the show . you ' re very wrong about that . it was johnny ' s and it comes from the original tv series so let me help to set the facts straight . to those of you who complained about the name of the show being stupid , well in england , it was actually called " danger man " and in the us it was retitled " secret agent man " for such a supposedly stupid name the show did well enough when it was first aired . 

granted this current show has little to do with the original , no such main character named drake in this one , and i guess they did their best to make this show their version of " secret agent man " . but it does use the redone version of the original theme song so that does tell you that this show was indeed meant to be a redone albeit however inferior redone version of the original series .  you know , as you get older , you somehow think the movies you did not like when you were younger , might have been because of your youth and inexperience . case in point , when i saw the godfather at age 14 , i thought it was boring . 20 years later , its an incredible movie to me . in other words , i grew up and began to appreciate great movies . 

so i rented dirty dancing with my girlfriend last night on her request , as she loved it at age 14 and i hated it at the same age . but i hoped , because i was young and stupid at age 14 , perhaps this would be a new experience for me . so i sat down with her to watch , hoping to be enlightened . 

well , the night after watching dirty dancing , i feel a violation . i feel like someone reached into my soul and robbed me of 2 hours of my life from watching this cheese fest . 

first , patrick swayze plays a 20 year old , but he looks like he is 35 . and the premise of the movie is him seducing some underage teenager , wooing her with his dance moves . really creepy . 

anyway , the movie is the clichÃ© plot where the " wrong side of the tracks " guy and the " rich smart girl " accidentally fall in love with each other . of course , their romance is fueled by the fact the " rich girl " can ' t dance a lick , so the " poor hero " teaches her in a week to become an expert dancer for the big end of vacation show , or something like that . 

but you guessed it : the disapproving father soon enters and forbids the two to see each other , and the movie progresses to secret meetings of dance lessons and love making . this all culminates into the final scene where the entire resort rallies around the two young lovers while the once antagonistic father accepts the 35 year old dancer as his teen daughter ' s new man . 

even my girlfriend whimpered at the end of the movie as she admitted it was not anything like she remembered . i didn ' t press her , but i did smirk a little , and put the godfather part ii in the dvd player .  based on the true story of two young americans who sold national secrets to the soviet union in the height of the cold war , " falcon and the snowman " wants to be both suspenseful and philosophical , and winds up falling short in both departments . it ' s less le carrÃ© than who cares . 

timothy hutton stars as christopher boyce , a former seminarian who , disgusted by watergate and the middle-class values around him , is probably the wrong guy to be hired by a company running spy satellites for the cia . sean penn plays his drug-dealing pal , daulton lee , who makes himself boyce ' s courier , delivering secret files to the soviet embassy in mexico city . an offbeat synth-jazz score , lack of sympathy or emotional attachment for anyone , and lots of scenes of guys getting angry in rooms all combine to deaden what could have a decent moral-dilemma thriller . 

it ' s really penn ' s movie despite the second billing ; his character gets to talk turkey with the russians while hutton plays with his pet falcon . hutton looks like they woke him up five minutes before they called " action " . with penn , it ' s a crapshoot whether you get a brilliant performance or an over-the-top one . here , it ' s a bit of both , but more the latter , especially in the second half when lee switches from coke to heroin . he screeches . he snorts . he crashes russian embassy parties . he gets pummeled with telephone books . he spits at himself in a mirror , a big goober he must have been saving for a paparazzi . " i don ' t know who my friends are anymore ! " he cries out . it ' s exhausting to just watch him . 

penn seems to have modeled lee somewhat on dustin hoffman ' s ratso rizzo from " midnight cowboy " , complete with overly nasal line readings and constant eye shifting . john schlesinger directed this film as well as " midnight cowboy " , but he seems to have had another hoffman film in mind , " the graduate " , throwing up scene after scene of boyce and lee poolside , trying to decide how to live their lives in their gilded cage . too bad no one suggested plastics . 

from the opening shots , news footage of american decline juxtaposed with boyce and his bird , " falcon " makes clear it is a message movie , though the message itself is far from clear , probably because the characters never come into focus . is boyce supposed to be an idealist ? or is he just a mercenary ? hutton and schlesinger don ' t seem to know , which makes it harder for us . meanwhile , opportunities to establish some suspense , like boyce stealing documents from the top secret " black vault " where he works or lee playing games with the russians , are interrupted by jump cuts to scenes of the pair with their families and friends . it ' s the normalcy of the story that schlesinger finds interesting , but it ' s the least interesting aspect for us . 

good stuff : it ' s interesting to see a film that works the 1970s vibe so early as this one , referencing maria muldaur and tang . dorian harewood , memorable in " full metal jacket " , has a nice turn as boyce ' s paranoid colleague gene , who shows boyce how to make margaritas with a shredder but has some serious ' nam issues beneath his partying exterior . macon mccalman is also fine in a totally different way as the no-nonsense boss who gives boyce his high-security job . david suchet as the russian embassy official who deals with lee makes for a fascinating blend of menace and amiability . 

but " falcon and the snowman " stands or falls on the the question of the two title characters , and neither the actors nor schlesinger are able to mine much in the way of answers . worse , after more than two hours in their alternately feral and catatonic company , you don ' t really want answers . you just want those credits to roll .  totally forgettable movie but an unbelievable soundtrack : i ' d give it ( soundtrack ) a 9 out of 10 . i have the cd and the guitar work ( nils lofgren ) is superb ! i saw the movie years ago and had to check imdb to remember what it was about . i obsessed about getting the soundtrack and have since had to replace it . it ranges from blues / soul / ballad to a dose of gospel . all songs written , arranged , produced and performed by nils lofgren who is the " other " lead guitarist opposite steve van zandt in the e street band . this dude can play ! the vocals are handled by nils ( he can ' t sing very good-too raspy ) , bonnie sheridan ( who is a great singer ) and tom lepson .  this is a comedy / romance movie directed by andy tennant , starring will smith , eva mendes and kevin james . 

it is about a professional dating doctor -will smith - known as ' hitch ' who helps men to land dates with the women they are interested in . he is currently helping a shapely , clumsy albert who is obsessed with a very powerful , famous and rich woman called allegra . at the same time , hitch has become interested in a gossip columnist , sara , - eva mendes - who has been assigned to write about allegra . when the best girlfriend of sara has a love disillusion with a man that sara thinks that is a client of hitch , she plots a revenge against hitch and the misunderstanding leads the two couples to a conflictive situation this film is not one that men should see as it has a lot of male-bashing and both subtle and blatant male-hating . there are also double standards that you would have to be blind not to spot . hitch and sara are both very guarded around the opposite sex , hitch still likes women despite his burns from them in the past and is teaching men to make them happy . but of course sara , is a sexist bigot who makes frequent sexist comments along the lines of " men want to have sex with anything that walks . " shes self-obsessed and knows she looks like a goddess and knows there are no ' real men ' out there . what annoyed me most of all was the ' bad ' guy who wanted a quick fumble with sara ' s best friend who is the classic example of a defenceless ' victim ' and even after being turned down physically by hitch , receives as blow to the pills from sara , after which she says " now i ' m satisfied . " add to that the " women are still oppressed " vibes you get from allegra not being allowed to spend her own money after asking permission from a table of men . in spite of all the rubbish assumptions and generalisations - women can always tell when you ain ' t being straight with them ? - this movie does have the correct point that in america , love simply doesn ' t exist . there are some funny parts in this film , such as albert and his dancing habits but this film overall , only beats the dreadful film honey by a marginal amount .  with my two stars i will probably make it to the head of the imdb Âhated it " -list for this apparently tremendously popular tv series . 

not least because of the enthusiastic comments on this website , i decided to purchase a dvd edition of the series . because i usually find british humour suits me just fine . i gave up in the middle of the second instalment Â and according to other comments the Âfunniest " bits were already through . 

so now i know , according to another comment , that i definitely lack a sense of humour . but then i had to laugh like crazy while watching ( and re-watching ) fawlty towers to which black books is Â albeit faintly Â thematically related . why the different reactions ? it might be a mere generation thing , and yet the differences can be pointed out . 

both fawlty towers and black books are set in businesses which are meant to sustain their owners financially . both businesses are not successful but seem Â by a miracle Â to survive . fawlty towers is funny because the protagonists have to deal with situations they cannot cope with . the funniness lies in the fact that they make a serious effort to succeed and while laughing one also feels sorry for them . black books has no situations , it ' s just there and the owner passes his time feeling sorry for himself . if a situation threatens to arise , it is quickly shooed away . it is remarkable how fast and how often a subject is dropped and the protagonists turn to something entirely different to produce an additional joke . telling jokes Â and not very good ones - seems to be all black books is about . why a bookstore ? a hardware store would have done the job just as well . 

no , stop , wait . it ' s a bookshop because below the veneer of rudeness , vulgarity and arrogance the protagonists are supposed to be delicate and cultured . they are not some lowbrow gorillas but bumbling semi-intellectual losers . hey , they are like you and me . the manner in which the series makes that claim is the only way i can explain its success . there is nothing remarkable in the protagonist ' s actions , what ' s special about them is their economically unrealistic living conditions many viewers maybe envy them for . that protagonists that narcissistic and vapid convey a sense of belonging and companionship seems to be a trademark of the time the first world is presently living in . 

recently i watched tittybangbang , also a fairly new british tv comedy show . i found it uproariously funny . it is often quite tasteless or xenophobic Â but always with a purpose and hitting the bull ' s eye in its social criticism . the humour is mainly created by situations or by characters with a purpose . the low ratings in imdb might indicate that this brand of humour is not in keeping with the times , but i am glad it ' s still alive and kicking and hope it will continue to do so .  lina mclaidlaw is a bright , solitary young women who falls unexpectedly in love with johnnie aysgarth , a highly eligible bachelor with a penchant for losing money . they get married , but almost at once lina is subjected to johnnie ' s addiction to lying , gambling and getting into debt . despite his flaws , she is unable to resist his charming manner , until she starts to suspect he may be harbouring murderous thoughts toward her . . . 

this is a good movie , well-made , with an attractive cast , a good script and possibly the single lousiest ending in movie history . okay , that ' s maybe going too far , but not by much . lots of films change the ending of a book ( great expectations , the shining , etc ) but the last two scenes of this one not only manage to be horribly lame , but also render the entire preceding plot completely meaningless . the story is about a woman whose husband is driven by his greed and moral lacking - and what she knows about him - to kill her . it should end ( as it does in francis iles / anthony berkeley ' s book before the fact ) with him attempting to murder her . the reason it doesn ' t is that the studio forced hitch to reshoot the ending , one of the first examples of the godawful process of preview audience testing . hitch was canny and did what he was told ( this was only his third film in hollywood ) knowing that if he played the game , sooner or later he would gain creative control of his films , evinced by his masterpieces of the fifties . but that still leaves us with a turkey of an ending . this is a great shame because it really is a very good movie with an intriguing theme - does anyone really know their husband or wife that well ? the script is excellent , with many off-guard moments ( such as when lina ' s father dies and johnnie assumes she ' s crying about it ) , a finely-judged performance by grant ( who never played a villain again ) and fine photography throughout , culminating in the famous glass-of-milk shot . fontaine won an oscar for this performance , although personally i prefer her confusion and vulnerability in her earlier victimised wife role in rebecca . i would like to rate this movie higher , but i really can ' t forgive that ending ; this is what happens when movies are made for money , not love , which i guess is curiously the theme of the film itself . look fast for hitchcock ' s cameo as a man posting a letter .  tom selleck plays an absentee son to senile " pop " don ameche and weary mom anne jackson , making up for his indiscretions ( one presumes ) and taking them in after ameche has burned down his mobile home ; meanwhile , selleck ' s job is vanquished by the f . b . i . , his assets are frozen , his wife and kids leave him and his obnoxious sister and her brats have come to stay . brightly-painted comedy-of-ills is as out of touch with reality as ameche ' s doddering old coot . perhaps a serious first draft ( with scenes such as ameche walking out into traffic with two toddlers ) was incorporated into a sillier second or third version ( with selleck getting poked , bumped , prodded , and eventually losing a toe and a testicle ! ) . either way , it ' s a painful experience , and selleck ' s sudden dedication to his father makes little sense ; he hobbles around and howls in pain , but retains his heart of mush . this movie is mush . * from * * * *  i want very much to believe that the above quote ( specifically , the english subtitle translation ) , which was actually written , not spoken , in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist , was meant to be self-referential in a tongue-in-cheek manner . but if so , director leos carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film . they are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that i have to conclude carax actually takes himself seriously here , or else has so much disdain for everyone , especially the viewing audience , that he can ' t be bothered letting anyone in on the joke . 

some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique , bizarre films because they do so with Ã©lan and unique personal style ( e . g . , david lynch and alejandro jodorowsky ) . others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story ( e . g . , krzysztof kieslowski , and david cronenberg ' s later , less bizarre works ) . in pola x , carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it . well , here it is : the pacing is erratic and choppy , in particular continuity is often dispensed with ; superfluous characters abound ( e . g . , the gypsy mother and child ) ; most of the performances are overwrought ; the lighting is often poor , particularly in the oft-discussed sex scene ; unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason ; and the list goes on . 

not to be completely negative , it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions . i liked the musical score , even the cacophonous industrial-techno music being played in the sprawling , abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film ( perhaps a reference to andy warhol ' s ' factory ' of the ' 60s ? ) . much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful , an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings . and , even well into middle-age , cathering deneuve shows that she still has ' it ' . her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn ' t sink into bathos . 

there was an earlier time when i would regard such films as " pola x " more charitably . experimentation is admirable , even when the experiment doesn ' t work . but carax tries nothing new here ; the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films , and after several decades of movie-viewing and literally thousands of films later , i simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal , poorly crafted tripe . at this early moment in the 21st century , one is left asking : with the exception of jean-pierre jeunet , are there * any * directors in france who know how to make a watchable movie anymore ? rating : 3 / 10 .  this vicious little film is horrendous . my low rating for it comes for two main reasons . the first is that it is an animal snuff film and i find that whole concept so vile it turns my stomach . filmed over a hundred years ago , i can only hope that we ' ve evolved into something a little more humane and compassionate . this film is complete and utter exploitation , made to cash in on the sensational aspects of the film and the subject . historical interest aside , this is something to watch only if one finds themselves in the grip of morbid fascination . 

reason number two ? look at the way that the camera is set up . it is placed in the best possible location to fully capture the full effect : long march forward of the elephant , perfect view of the electrocution platform and a cold and clinically dispassionate viewpoint of the elephant with smoke coming out of it before it finally collapses . sickening . 

thomas edison did many great things for civilization and his talents and intelligence aren ' t in doubt . nobody is perfect , but when you realize that this film provided a ) an opportunity for him to trump early cinematic competitors with a sensationalist film of an elephant being electrocuted and b ) he filmed the execution to demonstrate the greater effectiveness of dc as opposed to ac , you can ' t help but wonder if the scientist in him was a little too dispassionate and cold . any number of peter cushing ' s mad scientists would be proud . the rest of us should be ashamed and revolted .  a very mediocre film based on a superb series of stories and novels . i hope somebody , someday will be able to film it the right way . in the meantime , look for the books ( by a . sapkowski ) , a very inteligent , postmodern fantasy . by now there should be a translation in english , there translations in german for sure .  not many people remember " the carey treatment " , and i can ' t say i blame them . 

blake edwards did this during his lean years ( i . e . - between " pink panther " movies . ) and for a story of a doctor turned detective ( coburn ) working to solve a murder in his hospital , it ' s actually pretty forgettable . 

coburn is dependable as always and o ' neill is beautiful as always but there just seems to be something missing from the proceedings . the story twists and turns aren ' t very involving and even the climax , which is supposed to be nerve-wracking , is gut-wrenching instead . 

a missed opportunity altogether , and an unfortunate one at that , since it was based on a michael crichton book . 

oh well , at least crichton didn ' t write a sequel to it . 

one star . " carey " on , coburn .  this is one of those strange , self-important , self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound . it isn ' t . instead , it spouts cliches that try to pass for profundity . typical is the scene where peter ( kelsey grammer ) explains to protagonist and best friend adam ( dwier brown ) how man starts life breast feeding , then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend , and finally his wife , thus concluding ultimately that life sucks . so deep . we are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life , the universe , etc . during adam ' s travels through the mojave desert on foot . ( he abruptly leaves l . a . the day of his wedding and his family , friends , and fiance assume he ' s dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket . ) some characters are more entertaining than others . the best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others . the actor , james kevin ward , does some great impressions , including nicholson , popeye , and several characters from the original star trek . but once the interesting characters leave the screen , we ' re stuck with adam again and his pursuit of the profound . it ' s a long trip , which drags in many places . in fact , it ' s the longest hour and a half movie i ' ve ever seen . and the finale hardly makes it seem worth while , at all . 

i discovered this movie playing on hbo one day by waking up too early and clicking on the tv . that ' ll learn me . next time i ' ll try harder to sleep in .  this movie is everything but the true story of phoolan devi . director shekhar kapoor ' s claims are countered by the fact that he made the entire movie without even once meeting phoolan devi , on whose life this movie is supposed to be based ! the excuse being that meeting the woman would have interfered with director ' s conception of the story ! the film wastes the opportunity of sensitizing the society of the plight of low-caste women in the indian society and ends up as a stereotype portraying phoolan devi as an angry woman whose sole motivation is revenge . no wonder , this shekhar kapoor ' s film was successful in the west as it catered to their non-bollywood tastes !  franco zeffirelli ' s ( " the taming of the shrew , " " romeo and juliet , " " jesus of nazareth , " " othello " ) third stab at transferring shakespeare to the screen works very well , with the casting of mel gibson ( " mad max , " " lethal weapon " and pre- " the passion of the christ " notoriety ) in the role formerly owned by sir laurence olivier ( and rightly so ; see my review on his " hamlet , " arguably the best interpretation of one of the bard ' s timeless ( and most quoted ) tragedies ) and redone 5 years later by kenneth branagh as a full-bloodied treatment , explaining its 3 hour 22 minute running time , combined with a dream cast ( and a lot of little additions , which were well-chosen and expertly done by the contemporary master of william shakespeare , kenneth branagh , the director of " henry v " and " dead again . " joining the " lethal weapon " star are glenn close ( " the big chill " ) , paul scofield ( " a man for all seasons " ) , alan bates , ian holm , michael maloney ( who would be cast as roderigo opposite kenneth branagh and laurence fishburne in oliver parker ' s " othello " ( see my review of olivier ' s " stage " version of the tragedy , though he only starred in it ) and who branagh would cast as laertes in his 3-hour version of " hamlet " ( a proper homage to sir laurence olivier and his classic version of the play ; see my review on that one as well ) 5 years later ) , nathaniel parker ( who would be cast as cassio in his brother ' s version of " othello " 4 years later ) and helena bonham-carter , who would be cast in " mary shelley ' s frankenstein " 4 years later . 

zeffirelli intended this movie as a homage to sir laurence olivier ( who had died 2 years prior to this movie ) and it works pretty well , for the most part . what i was slightly uncomfortable with was zeffirelli ' s misplacing a lot of lines and in one scene , he gives one of hamlet ' s lines to the ghost . also , helena bonham-carter did not convince me as ophelia . she was too dull and unreal , whereas jean simmons ( who had immortalized the role in olivier ' s version ) and kate winslet ( who did an acceptable job in kenneth branagh ' s uncut , epic revisionist reworking of " hamlet " ) were good in the role , with jean simmons being the best ophelia ever , that ' s why she was nominated for best actress in 1948 ( she didn ' t win-what a shame ) . ian holm said his lines too quickly , not slowly as i expected him to , in a scene with him , laertes and ophelia . but then again , i ' m more used to felix aylmer and richard briers ' interpretations of the role and i think that they did better jobs than holm in their respective versions of " hamlet " ( both done by great directors , actors , text-editors , producers and stars of all their versions of the bard ' s work ) as polonius . 

the rest of the cast , however , was excellent . the scene where hamlet confronts his mother was very well done , but olivier and branagh heightened the scene to better lengths to create even more emotional intensity and suspense that the scene required . 

i recommend this version just to pass the time , but it ' s ideal as a teaching tool for 12th-grade english teachers ( i recommend showing olivier ' s version first , then branagh ' s and finally this version ) . despite the film ' s " pg " rating , there was really nothing objectionable in the movie . only what the play called for . 

the best versions of " hamlet " are : 

 # 1 sir laurence olivier and kenneth branagh . both were so good that i can ' t decide which one was the best . see my reviews on these versions for more information . 

 # 2 franco zeffirelli . this one was alright . it started out alright with a scene not in the play , but should ' ve then progressed to the actual beginning of the play , where a guard cries out " who ' s there ? " " nay , answer me . stand and unfold yourself ! ! " that scene scares the hell out of you because you ' re sitting quietly and then-bam ! ! , you almost jump out of your skin . in short , that scene sets the tone for the rest of the play . huge blunder on zeffirelli ' s part to omit that scene . it also misplaced a lot of lines ( and cut others that i think should ' ve been put in ) , such as the line where hamlet says to ophelia " get thee to a nunnery , why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners ? " ; that line was supposed to have occurred in that scene , not where it was placed in the film ( after the " to be or not to be " soliloquy . this version struggles between cutting out too much or too little from an excellent piece of literature . kenneth branagh would remedy that 5 years later with his uncut version of the tragedy , making his version a more fitting homage to sir laurence olivier , as several of the actors ( aside from him ) had performed " hamlet " on stage / or on film many times on different occasions . however , zeffirelli ' s take on " hamlet " is faithful to the play and that ' s what i was looking for . the setup for the final act duel was the same as in olivier and branagh ' s versions , only that the denouement in branagh ' s version was more violent than the denouement of the previous two faithful versions ( more in line with the play ; olivier toned it down . . . and it worked equally well ) and stuck more closely to the play , with branagh throwing in a few harmless touches of his own . . . to very good effect . 

this version is not rated .  even allowing for my unabashed love of the first two films in the franchise , and sweeping away any sort of biased leanings i might of had for the character of max , i just can ' t bring myself to rate at average this cartoonery waste of space that so nearly soils what had gone before it . 

gone is the rugged nasty streak that brought feeling to the character mad max rockatansky , gone is the impacting feeling of desolation in an apocalyptic world , and more crucially , gone is director george miller ' s passion for the franchise . the dreadful score matches the cartoon heart of the film , it seems that the makers didn ' t really know what to do with the amount of cash given to make this third {and thankfully last} instalment . sure the stunts are spot on {to be expected by now} , and of course miller manages to paint a barren desert landscape by purely lifting from what he has done before . yet he clearly struggled for fresh ideas with the action since the road warrior ' s crowning glory of the petrol tanker pursuit is replicated here , only he uses a train instead ! ! . 

it ' s just a very poor show that may have seemed like an ambitious turn of events back in the mid 1980s ; but when viewing the three films together now , thunderdome just comes across as a director losing his edgy approach whilst sadly getting caught between the mix of comedy and fantasy action . and the truth is that neither of those genre slants would have worked singularly , in the context of this series , anyway . i give the film 3 / 10 purely for one real good thunderdome fight sequence , while the stunt men here deserve some credit at the very least . but this is the third time i have tried to like this film , and as glutton for punishment as i undoubtedly am , i wont be trying again , ever .  writer & director robert downey , sr . , a pioneer of the underground film movement in the 1960s , satirized the new york madison avenue advertising world with his avant-garde comedy " putney swope . " downey doesn ' t confine his ridicule to advertising , but tackles black militant culture , the dynamics in hollywood ' s portrayal of race , the elite white power structure , and character of corruption in any power struggle . as audacious and ambitious as " putney swope " strives to be , it qualifies as a terrible film , amateurishly made on a shoe-string budget with a no-name cast and humor that lacks hilarity . everything about this movie reeks with improvisation . " putney swope " stirred up controversy during its initial release with its politically incorrect handling of race issues and consumer culture . like most marx brothers movies , the plot is thin , providing an excuse for downey ' s anecdotal gags , most of which are terrible . 

the chairman of a prestigious madison avenue ad agency dies during a board meeting . before the body has been removed , the board holds a secret ballot vote to determine who will replace him . each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself . sheer accident occurs when everyone votes for the token black member , putney swope ( arnold johnson ) , since none thought anybody would cast a ballot for him . swope pink slips all but one of the white executives , surrounds himself with black , pistol packing employees , and renames the firm " truth and soul advertising . " swope decides to alter the face of american advertising . he refuses to accept clients whose products are alcohol , tobacco , or war toys . swope ' s clients stage an exodus after he becomes the ceo , and grandstanding attracts a new line-up of clients that show up at his office lugging bags of money and prepared to suffer abuse from swope ' s militant employees . swope exploits his african-american staff , too , ruthlessly appropriating their ideas after he fires them and conjures up a number of offensive advertising campaigns , all of which are hailed as a ' new wave ' of marketing genius . incredibly , swope ' s conservatism proves successful but the agency becomes the target of government operatives who argue swope ' s advertising tactics constitute " a threat to the national security . " the high point of this black & white , 85-minute comedy are the television commercials shot in color . unfortunately , downey doesn ' t know when to cut off these ads that consistently start out cleverly but wear out their welcome . the funniest part of " putney swope " involves our eponymous protagonist ' s dealings with u . s . president mimeo in washington d . c . ( pepi hermine ) , a marihuana-toking midget with a kissinger-like teutonic adviser ( larry wolf ) spouting tasteless jokes while trying to convince swope to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car , the borman 6 .  i never heard of this film when it first came out . it must have sunk immediately . : o ) i saw it on cable while sick in hospital so i hardly had enough energy to watch it , let alone turn the channel . better choice than the style channel . ; 0 ( . filmed on location , this travelogue should have been on the travel channel . the plot is recycled from ship board farces of the thirties and forties . the cast seems to have been recycled from the fifties . donald o ' connor , star of musicals and edward mulhare as a card shark . as to the main cast , walter matthau is still playing the same part as he did in guys and dolls or was it the one about the orphan girl ? wiseacre irresponsible gambler and rounder . but it just doesn ' t take with a man of his age . as to jack lemmon , he plays his part so straight , he can hardly dip and glide when dancing . and as mentioned , dyan cannon is outstandingly attractive as another swindler sailing with her mother who thinks walter is rich , while he thinks she is rich . elaine stritch plays dyan ' s mother , another retread from the fifties . the most fun is the running feud between brent spiner as the domineering and snotty cruise director who immediately spots walter as a poor dancer , and spends his time trying to get him dismissed so he will have to pay for his free passage . in the end , though he receives his comeuppances . meanwhile jack mopes about , meets an attractive woman , with mutual attraction , but their affair is broken up by walter ' s lies that jack is a doctor , when he was actually a retired department store buyer . but finally , the two men take to the sea in a rubber boat to intercept her seaplane and all is well . there does not seem to be any principal player under the age of fifty .  this movie treads on very familiar ground -- the confusion of art and reality in the life of actors . it does not have anything particularly novel or interesting to say on this subject and is in fact rather dull . the final scene in particular is interminably tedious . seeing the audience crying at the " moving " acting they are seeing on the screen made me ask " who do they think they are kidding ? " 

nevertheless there are some good performances and interesting scenes , particularly from some of the minor characters . ben gazzara plays an old and slightly touched actor , who gets a whole posse of policemen clapping his performance when they come to arrest him . 

christopher walken again plays an over-the-top wacko . remember his character " the continental " on saturday night live ; an aging eurotrash satyr chasing a young woman around the furniture and trying to get her into bed ? he does an identical turn in the film , chasing his young ( male ) prey around an antique table and plying him with champagne . 

overall this film was both enchanting and irritating , but mostly irritating .  having seen carlo lizzani ' s documentary on luchino visconti , i was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by adam low . but the viewer like me did get dissatisfied . . . i faced a need for critical opinion , which i generally don ' t like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer . there are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally . but when i read the reviews already written on this title , i also felt a bit confused . people sometimes don ' t know what to criticize . therefore , to be clear , i ' ll divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably : the former one about visconti before his director ' s career and latter one about visconti the director . 

the aristocratic background , all the hobbies , the wealth that young luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented . his effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents ' divorce . we also get a very accurate idea of where luchino was brought up as a real count of milano : in riches galore , with nannies , cooks with access to everything , in true aristocracy . for instance , his father ' s splendid villa at grazzano and other marvelous villas prove that . there is also an emphasis on visconti ' s crucial visit in paris in the 1930s where he met eminent people ( " left wingers " ) who later had impact on his style and message in art . that clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upbringing ( a contrast at first sight ) . 

however , the part about his director ' s career , which started with ossessione during wwii and ended with innocente just before the director ' s death in 1976 , is poorly executed . his movies are not discussed well . why ? because there are very few people who really have something to say . franco zeffirelli , the director , remembers the works on la terra trema and that is all right . there are also some interviews with franco rosi . but later , such movies like il gattopardo , la caduta dei rei , la morte a venezia or ludwig are mostly discussed by helmut berger . although i liked the actor in the role of ludwig , i did not like the interviews of his . moreover , some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to entail in such a documentary . . . there is no mention of significant works of visconti like conversation piece , there are no interviews with eminent cast burt lancaster . a mention about silvana mangano and romy schneider should also be made . there is one footage interview with maria callas that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit . franco zeffirelli , though i appreciate him as a director , makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious . for instance , he mentions the event how visconti separated from him after years of service . therefore , i say : simplified and unsatisfactory . 

what i find a strong point here are footage interviews with visconti himself . as a result , we may get his own opinion about his works . for instance , i very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself . he also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming ludwig . 

i believe it is better to see luchino visconti ( 1999 ) by carlo lizzani than this doc . although it is shorter and condensed as a whole , you will get a better idea of the director . visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned people ' s emotions and viewpoints into stone . . . 4 / 10 not even original in the plot . ho hum . there were a couple of angles that could have been quite interesting , but the film follows the path of 90 % of hollywood movies . i don ' t really " get " samuel jackson ' s acting most of the time in his other films , but he was rather good in this film . he rarely yelled and went much further in his character rather than reverting to an " in your face anger . " i liked eva mendes - as usual - and even though she is great eye candy , she proves herself to be much more than that as an actress . luis guzman was actually really good also , except that i disliked the change of his character towards samuel jackson at the end of the film . how can one ' s character center around a dislike for a former cop and then turn into lollipop land within a split second ? is there no original thought left in hollywood ?  greeted with derision by most critics when it first appeared , ' frenzy ' has recently done the rounds of uk tv . i remember seeing it on its original release , and thinking then that if hitchcock wanted to parade some kind of screen confession about his ingrained misogynism , he couldn ' t have found a nastier little vehicle to do so . 

but time alters perspective , and so what was nauseatingly bad in 1972 might , all these years later , be worthy of upward re-evaluation . 

might . . . but not . ' frenzy ' is dross . the dross of an ageing director who desperately wanted to exploit the artistic freedom of 70s movie making without seeming to realise that freedom imposes its own obligations -- notably , the need to bring integrity to one ' s work . 

there ' s none here . and not much evidence of the earlier directorial brilliance , either -- the switch from spine-tingling implicit to odious explicit is neither shocking nor , for a supreme stylist , stylish : it ' s just banal ( the prolonged murder scene is precisely that : prolonged , without pace , without reason , without purpose other than the cheapest of directorial desires to appear as contemporary an artiste as , say , that other acclaimed practitioner of cheap sleaze , michael winner ) . 

and it goes from bad to worse , with dialog that defies any human provenance ( not least in the ludicrous diversion into the home life of our dear wooden inspector , and his wife ' s cooking ) . 

perhaps the scene that best sums up ' frenzy ' ( and endures as the most explicit indictment of hitchcock ' s persona ) is the clunking exchange between two lawyers in a bar , where they discuss the serial killings and then agree that at least the women had a good time first by being raped . 

i remember my revulsion at that scene back in ' 72 , and it ' s still undimmed , because this wasn ' t hitchcock being clever , or sardonic , or trying to make some universal point ( big themes , big truths , were not hitchcock ' s forte , nor personal preference . ) it was just hitchcock , allowing a reflection of his own distorted mirror on life to shine through the texture of the movie . 

calling ' frenzy ' hitchcock ' s last great masterpiece is to betray little if any understanding of just what hitchcock actually achieved in the way of cinematic trickery , cinematic thrills , and dazzling cinematic mastery . 

 ' frenzy ' is therefore now what it always was : a cheap , nasty , and ham-fisted movie that did no service to any of those involved , or to the memory of a film-maker who really was , in his hollywood days , one of the greatest there has ever been .  this movie is a shameful result of what happens when : 

a ) it is written , directed and produced by an idiot . and / or b ) it was rushed in production to satiate the poker / stu ungar craze . 

the story from beginning is uneven . vidmer spends too much time on ungar ' s childhood and not enough on some of the legendary tales -- such as counting cards , his blackjack escapades , the roll of money as id . he also leaves out mentions of other poker greats such as chip reese , brunson etc . the movie is a complete mess from beginning to end . 

if you want a more complete and accurate account , read the book one of a kind . if you thought the movie was good , read the book and change your mind .  leon errol handles his double role of uncle matt lindsay and lord basil epping superbly , but i have trouble liking the " mexican spitfire " series because they all are contrived to produce mistaken identities , and these are telegraphed way in advance . errol is funny as the stuffy lord epping , but i would have preferred a lot more wit and much less repetition . 

 the only thing in " sudden death " that outdoes the amount of non-stop action is the incredible number of plot holes . what with that , and the sheer amount of contrivances , one could hardly call what ' s left a storyline . to say the screenplay has borrowed from the " die hard " premise would be to make the world ' s most blatant understatement ! 

here we have a troubled hero working in the huge pittsburgh indoor ice rink as a fire marshall . on the night of the seventh game of the finals series he gets tickets so he can treat his estranged children to the deciding game , and of course spend a little time with them . also catching the match , but for political reasons , is the vice president of the united states ( raymond j . barry ) . when a bunch of incredibly well organised mercenaries capture the v . p . ' s box and demand hundreds of millions in government money , our hero darren mccord has his plans more than slightly put out . 

each time a new one of these formula flicks is made it seems that all we get in the way of innovation is nastier bad guys , and more and more spectacular and gruesome ways in which the good guys dispose of them . director hyams and his screenwriter have gone over the top ( not that this is an original sin ) in trying to make us loathe the wicked terrorists . the horrible baddies go about shooting the secret service , the security and the civilians ( both old and young ) with gay abandon , and with scant regard for the relative threat of each victim . 

van damme engages in plenty of fisty-cuffs and gunplay , heroics and death defying stunts . the script asks little of the musclebound european . almost everyone else has walk-ons apart from powers boothe , who seriously overdoes his under written , shallow role as the cruelest , meanest old ring leader there ever was . 

there ' s a lot of clever cinematography , and enough explosive special f / x to keep anyone awake . but really , that ' s all this action flick has , action . though there are some nifty sequences , nothing could be called outrageously brilliant . 

saturday , february 10 , 1996 - greater union melbourne 20th century fox ' s road house 1948 ) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie . full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov , who also produced , and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more . miscast is ida lupino in the leading role ! lupino , a lady who was capable of exuding about as much sex appeal as a blood orange , is here under the illusion she is rita hayworth playing the part of a sexy bar-room torch singer . handsome cornel wilde as her lover is as wooden as usual and totally wasted is the talented celeste holm who ' s role is little more than a bit part . then we have richard widmark who has the most ludicrously written part in the picture ! when we first see him he is a nice o . k . guy who runs a thriving road house . then suddenly - and for reasons that are not sufficiently made clear - he becomes insanely jealous of his manager ( wilde ) when the latter tells him that he is about to marry lupino . you see widmark wanted to marry her himself but - 1 ) he never proposed to her - 2 ) they never had a relationship ( they don ' t even have anything that resembles a love scene together ) and - 3 ) without telling anyone ( including lupino ) he has obtained a marriage license . wow ! so how widmark was to achieve something like wedded bliss with lupino after such a " courtship " is anybody ' s quess . huh ? well , when widmark goes to pieces over the whole affair so also does the movie i am sorry to say . from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical ! his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing . he finally goes over the edge , becomes completely deranged and with a few tommy udo sniggers , he laughably goes gunning for poor cornel wilde before biting the dust himself . 

and if that isn ' t enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors . there ' s not a single outdoor shot in the entire movie ! added to this - 95 % of the film takes place at night . 

besides an interactive press book and a photo gallery the extras also includes a featurette " widmark & lupino at fox " . whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me ! as far as i know they were never before together in a movie at fox or anywhere else ! however this featurette is hosted by such heavy hitter know-alls as robert osborne , eddie muller , rudy belhmer and a few others who amazingly heap praise on this wearisome and cringe - inducing affair . all i can say then it must be me i guess . but " road house " up to now was a forgotten and buried noir and as far as i am concerned it should have remained so . 

fox would do better if they issued dvds of superior and thus far elusive widmark movies like " down to the sea in ships " ( 1949 ) and the colourful " red skies of montana " ( 1952 ) .  something of a disappointment . lee j . cobb is the anti-union head of roxton garments in new york . his partner in the business is killed when an elevator is unleashed and plunges twenty-seven floors to the bottom of the shaft , in the scariest scene in the film . 

cobb doesn ' t know it , or doesn ' t let himself realize it , but the man behind the killing is richard boone , who protects the business from union organizers . 

then cobb ' s son , kerwin mathews , returns from europe determined to learn the business and join his father in running a clean shop . he ' s shocked -- shocked ! -- to learn that boone has been clobbering the union members and killing a few who have become irretrievably irritating . 

robert loggia is one of the organizers who is killed by a couple of boone ' s goons , led by wesley addy . loggia leaves behind a widow , gia scala , with whom mathews , understandably and decorously , takes up . 

in the end , cobb pays for his self deception , addy and boone get their just desserts , and mathews winds up with the succulent scala , after whom an opera house is named . 

there isn ' t a sparkle in any line of dialog . a couple of lines are stolen verbatim from " on the waterfront " -- " pistoleros " , " you ' ll talk yourself right into the grave . " the plot is schematic and holds absolutely no surprises . vincent sherman ' s direction is pedestrian . the photography is flat an uninspired , though there are a couple of nice shots of new york streets . 

lee j . cobb can act . in this case , it must have been easy for him because he replays johnny friendly from " on the waterfront , " only this time with a soft heart . richard boone can act too . joseph wiseman , in a minor part , does a good job . gia scala hits her marks , says what the script demands , and does what the director tells her to . a stunning woman , her life soured early on . the director and photographer do a good job on wesley addy . he has white hair , a blanched face , eyes the color of a glacial lake , and he ' s sometimes shot through a wide-angle lens than turns his surprisingly fleshy lips into those of some kind of parasitic fish . i don ' t see him as a low-tier muscle man though . he and boone should have switched roles . harold j . stone is his reliable self , although he ' s forced to be more " italian " , as tony , than comes naturally to him . nobody else in anything resembling a major part is more than mediocre , and some performers don ' t clear even that bar . kerwin mathews may be a nice guy in real life , but he ' s blandly sterile and belongs in domestic dramas on afternoon television . 

great title , suggestive of intrigue and shadows . some good people in the cast . a potentially explosive expose of a business nobody knows much about but which deals in megabucks . 

and it all comes out like this .  what distinguishes some of the ' lone star ' films ( and many others in western and adventure films of the early thirties ) was their lack of what we recognize as formulaic story telling . to be sure they had good vs . evil ( the basic element of any western ) , boy meets girl and some stock characters , such as the old rancher and his beautiful daughter or grand daughter , and sometimes the evil banker or other businessman , but the way the action played out was often different from film to film . 

 ' the lawless frontier ' features earl dwire in his big star turn ( not ) as ( for some inexplicable reason ) pandro zanti , a ' half apache , half american posing as a mexican who speaks the language fluently . ' his biggest posing as a mexican seemed to be his outrageous mariachi clothes . the only plot seems to be that he wants to steal ruby , the granddaughter of " old dusty " ( gabby hayes ) . when meeting her for the first time , dwire gives her a long once over look that puts him in the big leagues with sexual predators . you ' d think that because the opening scene shows zanti killing john ( wayne ) tobin ' s father off camera , it would play a bigger part in the film . it doesn ' t . too much chasing back and forth between heroes and villains . 

we get many good stunts , though , from yakima canutt , including pulling ruby up on his horse when he rides by , jumping on ' renegades ' and knocking them off their horses , a horse leap off a cliff into a lake , and even the same slide down the sluice sequence that was in " the lucky texan " ( 1934 ) , although this time the mighty yak uses a body surfing log instead of straddling a tree bough , and its inclusion is just as illogical this time too , since they are in a desert . 

the high point is clearly john wayne ' s measured and methodical well photographed walk across the desert after the fleeing and stumbling zanti with those fantastic basalt cliffs of red rock canyon ( seen in countless serials , westerns and science fiction ' moon ' movies ) framed behind him . no final gun duel at fifty paces with the heroine running from the wooden steps of the bar to embrace and kiss the conquering hero in this movie ! when john wayne finally catches up with him , zanti drinks poisoned water from a waterhole and dies . 

after a couple too many chase sequences , zantai ' s gang is finally captured in dusty ' s cabin , emerging one by one from behind a swivel cabinet that apparently leads to a canyon , now blocked off by having been dynamited . no riding off into the sunset or obligatorily kissing the girl : the final shot is ruby , now mrs . john tobin , on the telephone to the now sheriff john tobin , " what would sheriff tobin like for dinner ? " the film also has poor lighting and editing at the beginning , the pacing is slow , some parts with the sheriff cause it to drag , and the horse chases fill up the film . so despite the different and unusual elements , it comes off as one of the weaker lone stars .  in the 1940s , veronica lake made a meteoric rise to film stardom , thanks to her sultry beauty and , her highly exploited " peekaboo " hairstyle . she starred opposite big names like alan ladd and fredric march , scoring screen successes in films like " this gun for hire " and " i married a witch " . she held her own with female stars as well , and she surprised even her detractors with her performance as a bitter navy nurse in " so proudly we hail " . but changing times and her own failings caught up with her , and by the end of the decade , her heyday was over . with two unsuccessful marriages behind her ( and two more in her future ) veronica headed for new york city , where she made occasional television and summer stock appearances before dropping completely out of sight . it was briefly big news when she was found working as a barmaid in a second rate hotel in the early sixties . but by now , her longtime alcoholism and years of hard living had robbed her of her looks . without them , public interest in her soon faded again . she did return to the stage in assorted vehicles , but her success was minimal . eventually , she relocated to miami , florida , where she lived in relative obscurity . in 1966 she went to canada for a part in an obscure movie called " footsteps in the snow " which had no u . s . release . the following year , she was discovered by some industrial filmmakers who had long wanted to produce a commercial feature . they approached her to star in their film " time is terror " and convinced her to invest in the project . as one author put it , " if ever a movie queen suffered a terminal comedown , this was it " . surrounded by amateur performers and pathetic production values , she failed even to rise to a minimal level in this miami , florida shot quickie . looking utterly ordinary in long shots , and luridly aged in close-ups , poor veronica didn ' t act so much as walk through her part . as a deranged doctor , who has hit upon a successful youth restoration formula , using flesh-eating maggots ! , she looks both bored and confused , her most unintentionally hilarious moment coming when she is forced to ad-lib while she struggles gamefully to don a pair of rubber gloves . the supporting cast is no help at all , merely advancing the plot by talking it to death . director brad grinter apparently only required the actors to move while the camera was pointed at them , no need for anything resembling entertainment ( there is , admittedly , one unintentionally hilarious scene involving a private detective / nurse and a corpse in a wheelchair that predates ' ' weekend at bernie ' s ' ' by almost 20 years . ) according to veronica herself , the film was shelved for three years because no master shots were filmed . but in 1970 , the production company scraped it together , changed the title to " flesh feast " , and released it to cash in on lake ' s just published biography . and , because former leading ladies such as bette davis , joan crawford and olivia de havilland had unexpectedly revived their careers in horror movies , this travesty was promoted as veronica ' s " comeback film " . this seems a strange course of action for the filmmakers to pursue , though , because it ' s unlikely that the ( young ) audience for a horror film of this quality either knew or cared who veronica lake was . as expected , it did nothing for veronica ' s career , and she died in poverty , three years later . a previous reviewer cites a scene in which the female detective working undercover as a nurse in the doctor ' s laboratory ( overseeing the theft of bodies from a nearby morgue ) enlists the help of a multi-talented chauffeur to cut up the body parts . " poor mrs . lustig , " she sighs , " i hope she doesn ' t mind leaving her body to science . " " try not to think about it , " advises the chauffeur , sawing away . " i guess you are right , hans . " concludes the detective / nurse , " what is done is done . " what a sad end to the career of a still fondly remembered star .  this really is a film of two halves . the first detailing the lives and friendship of two boys ( one a privileged pashtun and the other a down-trodden hazara ) in late 70s afghanistan before the invasion by the ussr works extremely well . the young actors turn in convincing performances and seeing afghanistan as it once was throws the present situation there into stark relief . 

the real problem comes when we move into the later phase of the story where we join the pashtun as a man living in america . ancient debts to his young friend lead him to return to his homeland and it is really at this point that things break down . the central adult character is clearly supposed to be sympathetic , but in fact comes across as wimpish and wallowing in self pity . it is hard to really care for him and one cannot help but feel that the really interesting story is the one we do not get to see - that of his boyhood friend . 

once he returns to afghanistan the narrative becomes bogged down in a series of highly contrived coincidences . most remarkably he manages to come across his childhood enemy after all these years almost immediately ( even though he is not looking for him ) , despite the chaos that has since consumed the country . this enables him to confront past demons in a way that is simply too convenient to be credible . the resolution of the narrative is also run through with an awful , mawkish sentimentality which undermines any really serious points the film may be trying to make . 

although it is possible to start seeing characters and the abuses of their lives as symbols of a state which has been torn apart by world politics it is hard to really see this as a film which engages with any wider political discussion . instead the narrative becomes reduced to one character ' s emotional journey of self discovery and healing . unfortunately this character is so dull and wrapped up in himself that it is hard to really become engaged in his story , while opportunities to make a really interesting film about afghanistan itself are wasted .  based on a edgar rice burroughs novel , at the earth ' s core provides little more than means to escape and give your brain a rest . a victorian scientist dr . abner perry ( peter cushing ) invents a giant burrowing machine , which he and his american partner ( doug mcclure ) use to corkscrew their way deep into the earth to explore what mysteries it may hold . they soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures having conflict with prehistoric monsters . 

cushing comes across as an absent minded professor to the point of being annoying . instead of being a bold adventurer , he comes across effeminate . on the other hand mcclure overacted enough to make himself also laughable . caroline munro plays the pretty princess dia that refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth . also in the cast are : godfrey james , cy grant and michael crane .  since paul kersey was running short of actual relatives to avenge , the third installment in the " death wish " saga revolves on him returning to new york to visit an old war buddy . he arrives only to find out that brooklyn entirely changed into a pauperized gangland and that youthful thugs killed his friend and continuously terrorize all the other tenants of a ramshackle apartment building . kersey strikes a deal with the local police commissioner , conquers the heart of his blond attorney , blows away numerous villains with an impressive wildey magnum gun and gradually trains & inspires the petrified new yorkers to stand up for themselves . okay , there ' s no more point in defending the " death wish " series after seeing part three . the 1974 original was a masterpiece that revolved on the social drama as much as it did on the retribution and , even though it was pure exploitation , part two still had quite a few redeeming qualities and at least the events were a logically linked to those occurring in the first . number three frequently feels like a totally separate franchise . apparently , kersey isn ' t an architect anymore , he ' s ten times more social and talkative than he used to be and suddenly nobody , not even the police , is against vigilante actions anymore ? all these changes and several other aspects make it more than obvious that michael winner and charles bronson reduced their " death wish " success to being a purely brainless and exploitative action series , with a death toll that gigantically increases with each episode , armory that becomes more and more explosive and criminals that get nastier , sleazier , meaner and a lot harder to kill . however , the gentlemen didn ' t seem to realize that the non-stop spitfire of violence actually creates an opposite effect , namely this extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two . i once read a brilliant review that referred to " death wish 3 " as the pure definition of cinematic masturbation . this description couldn ' t be more spot-on , as the script tiredly moves itself from one repugnant execution sequence to the next . particularly the final twenty minutes are a complete " orgy " of gunfire , explosions and executions realized through improvised homemade measures . yi-haaa ! this entry in the series has quite an interesting supportive cast , including martin balsam ( " psycho " , " 12 angry men " ) as the fatigue neighbor who keeps machine guns in his closet , ed lauter ( " family plot " , " the longest yard " ) as the slightly unorthodox copper and even alex winter ( from " bill and ted ' s excellent adventure ! ) in his debut role as one of the thugs .  trekkies is really not a movie about star trek fandom . it ' s a freak show about those star trek fans who have no sense of reality . as a freak show , it ' s fine . but it is a mistake to think that this movie gives you an insight into star trek fans . most star trek fans cringe at what this movie shows .  a very disappointing film from oliver stone which , unlike his recent epic " j . f . k . " , fails to stimulate any sort of real emotion . " talk radio " is about talk-back host ' barry champlain ' , a very loud , opinionated man who manages to upset a lot of people and yet still draw an audience , most of whom mind you just want to ring up and abuse him . his boss in the movie ( alec baldwin ) sums up his character very well by saying he ' s just a shoe salesman with a big mouth . and as barry ( eric bogosian ) gets death threat upon death threat , the final outcome is almost inevitable . 

this is the sort of movie that usually has something very powerful to say . however , " talk radio " fails to make a serious comment and remains a frustrating , pointless film . 

thursday , september 17 , 1992 - video i saw this film as a sneak preview before the venice opening at the telluride film festival . your reaction to it will largely depend on your attitude about respecting the text of shakespeare . on the plus side : pacino gives a very good performance indeed as shylock ; lynn collins is a fine portia ; and the film has a sumptuous look . 

the negatives are predictable . " the merchant of venice " is arguably the most difficult of all of shakespeare ' s plays to stage today , largely because we look at it through the distorting lens of 20th century history . the romantic plot with bassanio and portia presents no problem . the character of shylock does , because we lack the original frame of reference of the elizabethan audience . shylock is simultaneously a human character with human qualities and motivations , and an abstraction of the pitiless quality of the old law . when he says " hath not a jew eyes ? " he is a character ; when he proclaims " i will have my bond ! " he is an abstraction . the long passage on music and cosmic harmony in the final scene ( here moved and cut to ribbons ) is the key to the play , in that it re-establishes universal harmony after the disruptive and evil ( the shylock of the trial scene ) forces are ejected . it is possible to make psychological sense of the character of shylock by showing his gradually going mad and turning into a monomaniac by the time the trial scene rolls around--the key is that at a point he must cease being sympathetic . 

pacino ' s performance almost does it , but not quite . the film can ' t quite make up its mind--on the one hand , there is the right movement in the character of shylock , and on the other there is a great deal of extraneous footage of jews being abused and venetian whores with rouged nipples ( no doubt to show the decadence of antonio et al ) . shakespeare was not writing an ibsen-like social drama ; he was writing a comedy following the classic pattern of disruption of social order and the restoration of social order , symbolized by marriage , with a theme of love versus law at the center of the shylock plot . 

in this sense , the film is a travesty--radford ' s surgery on the play and direction almost force us away from what the play really means . ( taking the beginning of the final scene , cutting most of it , and moving it before the trial scene is the most extreme example . ) there are some other significant difficulties . jeremy irons , a fine actor , plays antonio as if he were overdosed on sedatives . joseph fiennes is pretty but shallow as bassanio . most of the actors , with the exceptions of collins , pacino , and the actor playing the duke in the trial scene , mumble their dialogue . 

final verdict ? a pretty film with a few decent performances . it ' s not shakespeare , it ' s poor interpretation . not really worth your time or money--although lynn collins as portia almost redeems it .   . . . but not this one ! i always wanted to know " what happened " next . we will never know for sure what happened because gwtw was margaret ' s baby . i am a lifelong fan of gone with the wind and i could not have been more repulsed by the movie . i did compare " scarlett " to the original gwtw because any film worth following gwtw needed to be on the same quality level as the first . rhett was cast beautifully , although no one will ever compare to mr . gable . i am also a strict vivien leigh fan ! ! she was scarlett . she fit the bill . not another actress in this lifetime or another will ever fit the same shoes but with " scarlett " the job could have been done better . not enough thought went into finding the proper scarlett , that was evident . 

overall , something to look to but if you want to know the what happened to scarlett and rhett , i suggest writing it yourself or finding fan fiction . this movie is not worth the time .  shakalaka boom boom is a rip off from the movie amadeus . i personally rate amadeus as one of my favorites not only because it is about music , which is my favorite subject , but also because it tells us the real story of a musical genius who is not only remembered for the voluminous works of beautiful music he produced during his life-time , but for his own self-destructive nature and his tragic death at a young age of 35 , being virtually uncelebrated during his life time because of the politics played by some people , particularly saliere , the italian composer , who was jealous of him . 

personally , i was shocked to see shakalaka . . , as the director has invariably cut-pasted most of the scenes from the movie amadeus . i see the worst kind of plagiarism in this movie and am skeptic about the kind of movies bollywood keeps on churning day by day . the movie is a disaster , the two musicians in the movie don ' t give you any feeling of being realistic , the film is tasteless , meaningless and total failure on every count . the only person who makes an impact is bobby deol , who at least knows how to act . otherwise , the whole cast looks like a bunch of amateurs . 

the irony is that while watching the movie , the first screen in the movie says that all characters in this movie are fictitious and that any resemblance with anyone is purely coincidental which is a blatant lie , because all resemblances are very much clear and they are very much intended . i wish i could take darshan and co . to court not only for copyright infringement , but also for mutilating a beautiful work of art .  possible minor spoiler

it ' s not a terribly objective review but i just found this movie horribly depressing . like a lot of russell t . davies ' 

work , it asks more questions than it can answer . his best work ( bob & rose , doctor who ) revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat . these uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here . i suppose the fact that i ' m still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes . 

i would , however , disagree with the reviews i ' ve read complaining that the end feels " tacked on . " i think each conclusion follows logically from its premise and the ending represented a sound personal belief that neatly resolved the primary theme of the show . while i never really questioned the progression of events , i felt like there was much that could have been expanded upon . i ' ve also read that it was originally conceived as a four part series instead of two , and it ' s possible that the truncation has done some harm to the completed piece . however , these flaws appear throughout , in sequences and themes that sometimes feel rough or sketched in . 

to his credit davies is totally unafraid to write big , and you have to admire the sheer audacity and scope of this project . the premise he tackles here is the stuff of movies or novels Â it is a brave and ambitious thing to tackle it in the medium of television . strong points include christopher eccleston , who is positively mesmeric in the lead . for me , he was and remains the best reason to watch . the depiction of the messiah ' s humanity was brilliant , thought provoking and engaging and a real credit to both davies ' writing and eccleston ' s acting . i also thought the depiction of the modern world ' s reaction to the second coming rang true . 

so , two stars simply because i personally want my entertainment to be entertaining . i would rather be uplifted or , at least , distracted by my fiction . i have a whole big real world around me Â as filtered through cnn or the newspapers -- if i choose to be horribly depressed . there are definitely less subjective reasons by which to judge this piece but i ' m afraid my judgment in this matter is clouded by my emotional response .  this quirky and watchable film is the story of a deluded dentist who starts out on his mission or crusade to fight tooth decay in the back and beyonds of patagonia . hailing from northern ireland , via new jersey , the main character , fergus , sees his crusade as a mission of mass importance and approaches it with all the enthusiasm , vitality , discipline and attention to detail one would expect from a trained dentist . which adds to the hilarity , as his grand plans unravel and gradually fall to pieces as he goes from disaster to debacle in the patagonian outback on the back of a customised motor bike or his , er , mobile dental unit . we never get to meet his wife , nor the rich philanthropist who is sponsoring the ill-fated mission , but , we do get a solid display from lewis . fans of his work will not be disappointed with his very believable performance as the deluded dentist who is gallantly adored by the , innocent but sexy , 18 year old female lead who tags along on for the * ahem * ride . 

this film is not for everyone and i can understand why it wasn ' t pushed by the suits . it ' s a low budget , sometimes charming , always disarming , mildly amusing and instantly forgettable film that sets out with low expectations and almost succeeds .  a lot of alistair maclean ' s books have made it onto the big screen . some of them ( the guns of navarone , fear is the key , where eagles dare ) have been translated rather well ; some ( breakheart pass , ice station zebra , the secret ways ) have been passable enough ; a few ( river of death , bear island , the way to dusty death ) have been pretty rotten . caravan to vaccares is another movie based on one of maclean ' s perennially popular bestsellers , but alas this is yet another that deserves adding to the " rotten " list . peopled by uninteresting characters who get into uninteresting situations and escapades , caravan to vaccares is an absolute failure , both as a thriller and an entertainment . its only semi-redeeming qualities are : a ) that it is filmed on very attractive provence locations , and : b ) charlotte rampling looks utterly ravishing ( with fully nude scenes to boot ) as the main female character . 

disillusioned american drifter neil bowman ( david birney ) is travelling aimlessly through france when he meets british photographer lila ( charlotte rampling ) . they decide to accompany each other , and during their wanderings make the acquaintance of mysterious nobleman duc de croyter ( michel lonsdale ) . the duc persuades the pair to aid him in protecting and escorting hungarian scientist zuger ( michael bryant ) , who is sought by various shady parties because of some information that he is carrying in his head . kept secret from bowman and lila is the fact that zuger has discovered a secret formula for using solar power as cheap , economical energy . the hungarian needs desperately to get his formula to new york , but hired guns have been put on his trail to capture him Â presumably so that he can be taken back to some ruthless criminal lord and tortured into revealing his priceless secret , which they can then sell on to the highest bidder . bowman and lila find themselves and their terrified fugitive on the run in the french countryside from their deadly adversaries . 

the film seems terribly cheap and amateurish , almost like an ultra low-budget independent film made by a non-professional cast and crew . yet a fair sum of money was actually thrown at the film , and all those involved have , at various points in their careers , done much better work . therefore , one has to assume that the film is bad simply because it has been written , acted and directed with a distinct lack of care and interest . the pacing is deadly slow , and the plot points become so laborious that the viewer has to put in too much unrewarded effort to keep up with the story . birney ' s performance is uninvolving , and rampling only creates a stir due to her nude scenes Â the character itself is an absolute bore , and the actress looks rightly bored by it . for those who manage to stick with the film right to the very end , there is an unusual scene featuring some deadly rodeo clowns and a fierce bull ( ! ) which , while not particularly exciting or well executed , is at least different to the norm . caravan to vaccares is a very disappointing film in most respects , and once more a strong novel by the prolific author has suffered during its transition onto the screen .  it is is very sad to see someone of the calibre of george c scott in a low budget thriller which would have been better if the original novel was written by graham greene and directed by someone somewhat more experienced in the genre . not to mention a better cinematographer . there are so many missed opportunities with the scenery and carnival merely glossed over , rather than captured to locate the movie solidly in the exotic setting of the novel . 

elsewhere in the viewer comments on this site , one very astute observer complained about the variety of diabolically bad accents in this film . ever since i saw george c scott as rochester in jane eyre , i have prayed for him never to ever accept again a role which required him to assume a british accent . just every now and then , he could just possibly pass for british or a very british sounding south african played obviously by an american actor . i can stomach meryl streep ' s extraordinarily laboured accents ( both british and australian ) - at least she gets it right even though with every utterance , she demands that we marvel at her skill . well , i am sorry that mr . scott is no meryl streep , and it just destroys the illusion - like having michele yeoh speak excruciating mandarin with a strong singaporean accent in crouching tiger etc . 

peterson acts no differently than what we see on csi . except he is still very handsome and more or less slim in this movie . he is the harrison ford of tv . same old expressions for every emotion , every situation . no on second thought , ford has two - perplexed / pained and happy . i have never seen a smile on mr . csi !  i saw the film many times , and every time i am more and more disappointed , which is shame because the films from ex yu are usually very good . the shame here is , that holiwood tried to make film about the place and people it has no idea . my self coming from the balkans ( macedonia ) found this film disappointing . simply that the bosnian characters are not really understood and not truly portrayed . to understand the mentality of a person from ex yu , you need to know their background , way of live , what makes them cry and laugh . and the director of the film didn ' t took that as guideline . when we ( ex yu ) make films , lots of symbolism is build in it , which makes the characters recognisable and likable , and mostly portraying the truth ( if it is based on true story ) the films like " pritty village , pretty flame " , " tito and me ' , " underground ' , " no mans land ' , " before the rain " , " black cat , white cat " , " otac na sluzbenom putu " , ( when father was away on business ) , " ko to tamo peva " ( who sings over there ? ) rare the masterpiece of the balkan cinematography , and nothing can compare to it . not the half baked story of and holiwood studio . as somebody from the panel mentioned the story jumps from one end of town to the other with no real connection . i am sorry but when the film is made is not only for the american armchair variety of viewers but for the rest of the world too , and some of them live on the balkans and sarajevo too . and to add insult to the injury , half of the things are shoot in bitola , macedonia where i come from . imagen my shock when i saw the broad st . of bitola in the opening scene of the film , when the bride is shoot from the sniper . and what was that inserting real footage of the news covering in the film ? anyway very disappointing , as the truth is far away from the film . shame that nobody consulted the real people how is to live in sarajevo under fire , before they shoot the film . book is one thing and real life is other , and this film lets down both .  so after the initial disappointment of the first final fantasy movie , which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the final fantasy series , final fantasy : advent children has released itself to a warm reception and , now , a dedicated fanbase . and the reason for the films success is understandable as it has lush graphics , fast moving fight sequences and some cool as hell characters . however , if you haven ' t played ff7 then it is likely that you will not enjoy this film as it ' s storyline carries on from the game without previous explanation and your likely to get lost from the plot even if you have played the game . secondly , there is no character development , without previous knowledge from the game your opinions on the characters are limited to ' cool ' and ' not cool ' . of course , for ff7 fans the film is almost guaranteed to entertain , at least for nostalgic reasons , and it ' s cool seeing all the characters you grew to love from the game rendered in some pretty amazing computer animation . one last complaint , the film , at least in my opinion , attempted to cram too much into less than two hours and therefore the last half hour or so seems horribly rushed . if you played and enjoyed ff7 than it is a worthwhile watch , though nothing too special . if you have not played ff7 then it is best that you play it first before watching this film .  this was a sordid and dreary mess . i needed a shower when it was over . it goes something like this- some socialites are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case . she discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society , and she befriends an associate of the group who may have relevant information . since the detective is an attractive woman , of course she is horny and intrigued ( which reveals much about hollywood and its psychosis about women ) . what ' s surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting , just depressing and yucky . ellen barkin gives a respectable performance as the lead detective , and julian sands provides unintentional laughs as a cross-dressing psychiatrist , which is why it escapes a one-star rating .  i find myself alarmed that people are not so critical of a work that deserves criticism . the many similarities , both structurally and literally , with ' amadeus ' aside the ' copying beethoven ' deliberately chooses the easy path by putting audience before art . and therefore denying the world a discerning , intelligent and creative work . 

now consider the following : is it not possible that the real story of the creation of the ninth symphony may actually be an engaging and powerful story itself and equally so in a dramatic telling ? beethoven was completely deaf by the writing of the symphony Â isn ' t that more interesting ? how was the symphony conducted ? wouldn ' t it be great to know ? so ask yourself , what possible motivation could a filmmaker have for introducing a woman as the copyist ? if there was a copyist , he would certainly be a man . what was his story ? ( please try to be a little critical here even if you like the invention of a woman composer ) . 

fantasy should be much more than a distortion of reality to serve a writers purpose . for those who find themselves comparing and justifying the invention of anna holtz with the invention of salieri ' s claim to have murdered mozart in ' amadeus ' , consider that he confessing to a priest in a lunatic asylum ( schaffer uses this device to great affect in the film ) . ' copying beethoven ' may have worked if anna was a figment of ludwig ' s fevered imagination . but we are meant to believe she is ' possible ' . . . yes and that strauss was assisted by aliens . 

most of the positive reviews i ' ve read here so far are often expressions of a desire for the film to be good ; almost a deliberate amnesia . remembering the film for what you wish it to be rather than what it is . 

for those who believe that fantasy justifies the means then consider you are not only accepting an inferior interpretation of real events but also sacrificing the truth for the sake of a triviality . 

finally , a short note on the acting here that may surprise some of you . ed harris is not good as ludwig van beethoven . does that shock you ? he looks awkward throughout the film , much like an actor dressed up , but off set and standing at the catering table . most of his lines are said as cues rather than replies to anna holtz ' s lines ( i . e . he is not listening to the actor ) . he is quite clearly an actor masquerading as the character rather than being the character . 

really , how many times does beethoven have to roll in his grave before we get it right ? just ask yourself , would ludwig approve ?  randy bowers ( john wayne ) comes upon the half way house at just the right time to take a break from the trail , and discovers a slew of dead bodies inside , among them a man he was supposed to deliver a message to - ed rogers , proprietor of the establishment . he ' s observed by the dead man ' s niece sally ( alberta vaughn ) , from behind a hidden room , where she remained unobserved during the carnage . 

 " randy rides alone " was directed by harry fraser . he uses a filming technique here as in other of his films , where he fast forwards the action from one location to another , usually involving a rider on a horse . it ' s pretty well done and appears quite innovative in these 1930 ' s era lone star westerns . 

pre-gabby george hayes is on hand , sans whiskers , and this is the first time i ' ve seen him as a villain . in fact it took a few scenes to realize it was him in a dual role , first as hunchbacked businessman " matt the mute " , communicating via pencil and paper , only to turn into marvin black , leader of a gang of outlaws . black ' s gang was responsible for the murders at half way house , in an attempt to coerce sally into selling out to matt / marvin . another staple player is here as well , yakima canutt as a black henchman named spike . interestingly , yakima portrayed a villain named sam black in another fraser / wayne oater , " neath the arizona skies " . 

there ' s a fair amount of time-killing horseback riding back and forth between black ' s gang and the sheriff ' s posse , as john wayne ' s character maneuvers to expose the bad guys . in the end , he saves the day by securing sally rogers ' thirty thousand dollars , at the expense of destroying the half way house , where he exchanges some sticks of dynamite for the loot in a safe . greedy marvin black attempts to open it with his six-shooter , and the explosion is a fitting end for the villain . in his best " aw shucks " attitude , john wayne falls under the spell of the pretty sally rogers , and alas , randy rides alone no more !  there is a growing trend in the media to vilify and ridicule men . one sees it in television adverts and program plots . cheaters is a prime example , they could find plenty of female cheaters yet the vast majority shown are men , why ? the prime threat to any government ' s power resides in the male population , they ' re less likely to abide by authority and are more of a physical combat threat . a way to reduce the threat is to emasculate men in society via the media . other examples of psychological propaganda are crime dramas full of self righteous cops including big-jawed aggressive women accusing everyone they question trampling their rights and making those men feel like scum . in australia many top male sports stars have been arrested recently for dubious assaults and drinking charges , another example of the government controlling the male populous by arresting their heroes and asserting dominance . cheaters , aside from the political machinations is an invasion of privacy and a violation of rights , furthermore most of these women assault the men ! if it were round the other way the men would be in jail ! ! if it were an honest show they would be finding women cheaters , because they don ' t normally get caught due to the fact that their male lovers are quite happy to get in no strings attached and get out without rocking the boat . men ' s mistresses want the men to themselves and want to own and control the men and thus get the men caught anyway .  this soap is worse than bad : it ' s poisonous . of the many television shows that have had a corrosive influence on british society over the past twenty years , eastenders is the prime example . for two decades this show has celebrated the oaf , the thug , the wide-boy , the tart , the gobby , the violent , the sexually-incontinent , the criminal , the ignorant , the unambitious . . . 

how many times has someone or other remarked that eastenders " mirrors life " ? life on which planet , exactly ? 

it ' s written about " working-class " characters , as imagined by middle-class people who have taken a course in creative writing . eager to show to their middle-class peers how familiar they are with the " working-class " they dream up the lumpen rabble that is the citizenry of eastenders . 

this has a toxic effect on some minds less well-equipped than others to handle fiction , and so we find members of the real population assuming the attitudes and demeanour of the inhabitants of walford . 

thus , it came to pass that eastenders mirrors life ; but only after life had been hoodwinked into mirroring eastenders . 

other soaps have followed in ee ' s footsteps , filled to their stinking gunwhales with ugly , potato-faced , shaven-headed , pot-bellied characters , scowling at each other and issuing threats constantly . this is the proletariat as perceived by the writers who produce this trash . the writers will grow rich on the proceeds of such output , and will go on to enjoy the finer things of life in their rarified enclaves . meanwhile , the burgeoning number of new , tv-induced drones will proceed inexorably toward cultural bankruptcy . 

and there you have the new priests and the new creatures of the early 21st century . much of this is due to the immeasurable power of that illuminated boxful of dancing pixels in the corner of your living-room . it ' s your fault , gentle reader : that ' s what you chose as the only window through which to look out from your prison .  don ' t be fooled by the other reviewers . although this film contains an impressive array of talent , the material they present leaves a great deal to be desired . nat king cole ' s 3 numbers are pretty lame and not even close to his later efforts , though he does impress with his piano playing . ' moms ' mabley is not a bit funny , though i remember her as a very entertaining talk show guest from my youth . actually , the best performances are from a couple of fat guys who impress with a lively tap dance and a four tops takeoff , and the jazz band itself , especially in the number featuring the bass player . the print itself is pretty poor quality , and the wonderful butterfly mcqueen is totally wasted in the wraparound plot .  while traveling by train , a woman ( stÃ©phane excoffier ) mistakenly gets out in a remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night . sooner she finds that a weird lonely pointsman ( jim van der woude ) that does not speak her language is the only person in that area and that that was the last train in that track . the man lodges her in his house and they develop an unusual wordless relationship between them . 

 " de wisselwachter " is an overrated boredom , with a different but uninteresting story that goes nowhere . i like movies off-hollywood , but this story is too absurd and has no message in the end . the sexual tension between the two lead characters is funny in a moment but too repetitive . i saw this movie in an old vhs and the image is too dark ; i do not know whether on dvd the image would be of better quality . in the end , i was absolutely disappointed with this feature . my vote is three . 

title ( brazil ) : " o homem da linha " ( " the man of the line " )  essentially a undistinguished b-movie that mysteriously is directed by one of the golden era ' s major talents , fritz lang . even with the stellar names of lang , walter pidgeon , joan bennett and george sanders , be prepared for a ludicrous storyline , bad acting , patently phony sets and miscasting . for transparency sake , i have to admit i am an ardent non-admirer of walter pidgeon , who was lucky to have found a niche at the artificial dream-factory of mgm , and somehow worked in secondary roles , supporting greer garson and others . he is wildly miscast , acting in a chipper , ' 30s-ray milland madcap comedy tone , in a role where his life is in danger , and he is in hiding . joan bennett ' s cockney accent is excessive , but her lacquered hair , perfect makeup and classy outfit belies a street-wise cockney slum-girl . george sanders is incapable of bad acting , but disappears after the preposterous opening finds pidgeon somehow pretending to shoot adolph hitler . surprising for fritz lang is the unevenness of tone . i found the film wavered uneasily between occasional moments of suspense-thriller surrounded by light-hearted comedic interplay . hitchcock totally reversed the ratio , using comic relief to occasionally pace the suspense . there is a reason this film is unknown . it didn ' t serve or propel anybody ' s career or reputation , and is forgotten because it ' s a surprisingly bad film from such a pedigreed group .  this movie features a pretty decent fx sequence of an earthquake for 1936 . the reason you haven ' t seen it , is because audiences in the 30s were enamored of the " jeanette macdonald picture ; " in which the eponymous star warbled her way through countless songs , while plots came to a complete standstill . the fx cross time very well . macdonald ' s songs do not , and the awkward insertion of said songs to show off her only typical talent is not good . 

the hoary device of two friends growing up to become a priest and a hoodlum is given another run through the machinery ( manhattan melodrama , the departed ) . at the 30 minute mark , you ' ve already heard the song ' san francisco ' three times . entertainment in the thirties is generally an accumulation of irritation . only grand hotel from the decade foregoes annoyance to the degree shown in san francisco , dinner at 8 , little caesar , stagecoach , all quiet on the western front , les miserables etc . .  this is an extremely competent movie technically . the camera work and direction are excellent and the acting is fine as well--especially the fine acting by daniel auteuil as the marquis . i really thought there were no problems at all with these aspects of the film . instead , i was a bit annoyed by the way the marquis was portrayed , as it didn ' t seem all that honest and seems to be a very revisionistic view of history . in fact , in recent years , the marquis has undergone a bit of a transformation to a defender of freedom with great insight , not the fat sado-masochist rapist he really was . in a way , this is highly reminiscent of the whitewash given in the people versus larry flint--where these men are elevated to hero status . even if you don ' t think that the marquis ' perversions weren ' t all that bad ( they included rapes and extreme violence ) , his portrayal in this film as a " sexual social worker " in this prison seems pretty silly . instead of the violent and selfish sade , he spends a lot of time carefully grooming a young virgin and slowly helps her to explore her own sensuality . what a nice and kind man . in fact , now that i think about it , this performance reminds me of the man maurice chavalier played in gigi ( but without the singing ) --a cute older man who loves the ladies . i strongly doubt the real-life marquis de sade would have recognized this character at all ! 

the film , surprisingly , doesn ' t have a lot of nudity , though what it does show is extremely explicit . only a maniac would let their kids see this as this is a very adult drama . it ' s very well-made and pretty entertaining--just not all that truthful . the director admits that the film is largely fictional in the interview among the special features on the dvd i watched . so go ahead and see the film if you ' d like--understanding it just isn ' t very good historically . during the 18th century , sexual libertines were quite accepted in france as they were pretty broad-minded , so despite what the movie implies it wasn ' t sex that was the issue , it was the violence and rape that was ( and still is ) the problem .  ben , ( rupert grint ) , is a deeply unhappy adolescent , the son of his unhappily married parents . his father , ( nicholas farrell ) , is a vicar and his mother , ( laura linney ) , is . . . well , let ' s just say she ' s a somewhat hypocritical soldier in jesus ' army . it ' s only when he takes a summer job as an assistant to a foul-mouthed , eccentric , once-famous and now-forgotten actress evie walton , ( julie walters ) , that he finally finds himself in true ' harold and maude ' fashion . of course , evie is deeply unhappy herself and it ' s only when these two sad sacks find each other that they can put their mutual misery aside and hit the road to happiness . 

of course it ' s corny and sentimental and very predictable but it has a hard side to it , too and walters , who could sleep-walk her way through this sort of thing if she wanted , is excellent . it ' s when she puts the craziness to one side and finds the pathos in the character , ( like hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink ) , that she ' s at her best . the problem is she ' s the only interesting character in the film ( and it ' s not because of the script which doesn ' t do anybody any favours ) . grint , on the other hand , isn ' t just unhappy ; he ' s a bit of a bore as well while linney ' s starched bitch is completely one-dimensional . ( still , she ' s got the english accent off pat ) . the best that can be said for it is that it ' s mildly enjoyable - with the emphasis on the mildly .  after his career as a romantic leading man ended in the late 1960s , rock hudson starred in lots of different projects , including tv shows and lesser films . however , i believe that " embryo " is his only turn as a mad scientist , and that ' s probably a good thing . i guess he needed the work . 

driving along one dark and stormy night , brilliant dr . paul holliston ( hudson ) hits and injures a doberman , which he brings back to his lab ( that looks somewhat like a dank midwestern basement ) . he then manages to raise the dog ' s unborn puppy outside the womb , so naturally he decides to do the same thing with a human being . he raises victoria ( the beautiful barbara carrera ) from a fetus the same way . victoria grows at an astonishing pace , and soon blossoms into a gorgeous young woman . 

predictably , things go very wrong . after a halcyon beginning , holliston ' s sister-in-law martha ( diane ladd ) begins to wonder where the young woman came from , and victoria herself begins to show signs of instability and violence . the final sequence is one long car chase straight out of " smokey and the bandit " , after which victoriaÂwho has shockingly aged in just a few minutesÂis assaulted by a frantic holliston , who tries in vain to destroy his malformed creation along with its unborn child . all of this is accompanied by screeching tires , roaring engines , a car fire , and lots of sirens . the limp endingÂa bunch of paramedics frantically working on victoria while holliston writhes in regretÂis more labored than creepy . 

although just made in 1976 , this movie is very dated . the only difference between this and the many 1940s mad scientist movies is that hudson plays the lead role rather than boris karloff . the sets are pretty cheap and very antiquated to today ' s audiences , to the extent that hudson ' s reel-to-reel tape recorder is about the size of a refrigerator . much of the action takes place in a poorly lighted laboratory . hudson sleepwalks through his sordid role , giving the impression that he ' s truly a washed-up movie star , while ladd and carrera are much more believable . surprisingly , roddy mcdowall pops up briefly as a chess player . 

the passport video transfer is very substandard , looking as though it had been made from a poor vhs copy using home equipment . if you ' re nostalgic for 1976 , watch this once just to say you did . otherwise , watch a football game or soap opera instead .  a tedious effort from not-yet great director budd boetticher and pretty but not-yet un-bland actress nina foch , this movie is , as one of the other reviewers notes , is the quintessence of a certain kind of b movie . it ' s just not the good kind . and a promising premise and an overactive fog machine is wasted . 

basic plot -- nina , a nurse on leave from wartime duties on account of her nerves , has a nightmare . she meets a dashing fellow at the resort where she ' s giving her nerves a breather , and realizes he ' s in the dream , even though she ' s never met him before . meanwhile , it turns out our dashing guy is working as a spy , and is about to go on an-extra secret , hush-hush mission that must not fail . 

of course , there are nazis . and plot holes . and smart people acting in a fashion most likely to get them into entirely unnecessary scrapes , so that the running time can be spun out past an hour . at the end , the movie becomes a contest between which group of spies can act more foolishly . if the fbi and oss had acted like this crew , we ' d have lost the war in ' 42 . 

the movie itself is rather flatly shot ( despite the best efforts of the fog machine ) and the acting -- as it seems to be in many of the columbia bs tcm has been showing lately -- is curiously unengaged . it ' s less stylized than what one might find from a similarly budgeted warner bros movie , but also less fun to watch . 

boetticher ' s strength , of course , is a rather matter of fact style which allows the strong stories and acting in his randolph scott westerns to come to the fore . maybe the problem here is that such a style is not going to work when the script is lousy and the actors tired from their five film a year schedule .  after seeing the film version of heart of darkness , i feel as if i wasted 100 minutes of my life . though the book was not my favorite , i was very disappointed to see how poorly nicolas roeg portrayed the story . despite the fact that he left out many bits of important information , the cast just did not seem to fit their roles and the whole film seemed vastly emotionless . the book depicts vivid scenery and detail that are completely disregarded in the movie . 

you ' d think a director would be able to fit 76 pages of a book into a film of at least an hour and a half . the differences completely changed the story for me . for example , when the character of kurtz ' s fiancÃ©e is nonchalant to the fact that kurtz has died , it completely modifies the ending the book had given . not to mention the sets and scenery used in the film were not nearly as beautiful as they were described . it sincerely feels as if roeg was filming another story with references from heart of darkness embedded in it . 

if you watch the movie without knowing the title or expecting it to be anything like joseph conrad ' s tale , you may find it good . though i thought the camera work was poor and the cast unfitting , it is a captivating story all the same . however , if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story , don ' t look for it in roeg ' s film .  although many billie dove fans are delighted with her work here , i have to pass . as a socially prominent member of the british smart set , her british accent is basically non-existent and her line readings sound just like , well , line readings and her emoting seems trance-like and ponderous . basil rathbone , usually a fine actor , seems off-kilter throughout and also speaks with a weird sort-of-accent - in his case something like italian , though we cannot be sure . the script manages to keep his precise ethnicity a secret . he is further hampered by the script which gives him one of those old movie diseases , something to do with nerves , which requires surgery . the only real entertainment is provided by the illustrious kay francis sporting a lacquered bob with side curls in her role as a depraved countess who shamelessly devours men , including rathbone , and then spits them out . she pulls it off with her unique aplomb . she is the only living thing in this dead sea of a film .  with all of its technical flash , the 1993 " stalingrad " movie is very disappointing . before watching it i had read non-fiction accounts of the stalingrad campaign and had seen a lot of documentary footage and photographs of the actual battle and its participants . i don ' t think that any movie can really succeed in depicting the titanic struggle and suffering that actually occurred , but i still wanted to see what a relatively recent german movie production would be like . while there are a few good elements of this movie , overall it is a failure . to me the worst aspect is that it includes substantial anachronisms , and also some very contrived and clichÃ©d elements , most glaringly in some encounters between a german officer and a soviet woman . 

also there are some ideological elements in the movie which result in very distorted perceptions , including what amounts to a caricature of a german chaplain , some overblown class-warfare messages , and problematic depictions of " good " vs . " bad " germans . certainly the german armed forces of world war ii included men who were able to maintain some decency throughout the war , and others who did very bad things , but the attempts in the movie to show this contrast are very simplistic and childish . i give " stalingrad " credit in the sense that it doesn ' t completely portray german troops in the simple demonic quality which is the stereotype that many people now have , yet the movie includes stereotypes of its own , such as an almost too-good-to-be-true infantryman who has attitudes more akin to the 1990 ' s than the 1940 ' s , and two completely evil infantrymen and a rear-echelon officer . 

some recent movies such as " stalingrad " and " saving private ryan " are frequently praised for their " authenticity " in depicting graphic scenes of combat , yet these same movies are deeply flawed and distorted in their depictions of the attitudes , values and behaviors of 1940 ' s soldiers and civilians . " stalingrad " and " s . p . r " have major and minor characters who lack the unselfconscious stoicism that was common among regular people during the world war ii period . certainly soldiers throughout history have been notorious for their frequent grumbling and occasional cynicism , yet the self-absorbed , talky and touchy-feely characters in both of these movies are something else , and are much more prevalent in our world of today than they were in the 1940 ' s . while many people these days like to denigrate war movies from the 40 ' s and 50 ' s which present more patriotic messages and aren ' t as graphic about combat , many of those earlier movies such as " battleground " are much more accurate in their depictions of typical soldiers ' attitudes , and they are often successful in showing the horrible effects of war in more indirect ways . 

one well-done part of " stalingrad " is a battle between german infantry and soviet tanks , which does a reasonable job of capturing some of the horror and confusion in such combat . 

 " stalingrad " does a poor job though of showing the common look of the frontline soldier . part of this might be due to the difficulty in finding thin , haggard-looking extras in our pampered and well-fed america and western europe of today . also , too many of the german troops in the movie don ' t wear their uniforms and equipment properly , and don ' t display the professional bearing that was common in the german wehrmacht even during the years of german defeat . if you want to get a good idea of how the actual german troops looked , i recommend the following documentaries which contain footage of the stalingrad campaign : " the world at war , " " war of the century " and " russia ' s war . " also the books " operation barbarossa in photographs " by paul carell , " stalingrad " by geoffrey jukes and " stalingrad " by paul carell contain a great many helpful photos . books written about the battle by antony beevor and william craig are recommended also , and the latter one is especially good about the common soldiers and civilians on both sides . 

relatively recent movies which , in my opinion , are much better than " stalingrad " and " saving private ryan " in depicting attitudes and characters of persons during world war ii , and the general feel , look , horror and grittiness of that war , are " der untergang " ( " the downfall " ) and " talvisota " ( " the winter war " ) . while " a bridge too far " and " the longest day " cover events on the western front rather than in the east , they are also excellent war movies , and stick very close to factual accounts . the latter two movies lack some of the grit that is more prevalent in more recent films , but they compensate for that lack with their other strengths , including truthfulness .  the riddle was written and directed by brendan foley in what appears to be an attempt to pull the mysteries of the charles dickens ' novels into a contemporary story , but that attempt is thwarted by electing to use the two periods of time format in which the ' riddle ' is unraveled . despite a cast of well-known actors , trying their best to pull off this direct to dvd movie , the end product is a long , tedious , amateurish mess that can only be considered as entertainment if viewers are fans of the cast as remembered from other films . 

mike sullivan ( vinnie jones ) is a journalist confined to reporting on dog racing events while he dreams of important reporting assignments . a series of similar murders happens to include an old friend of mike ' s - sadie ( vera day ) who runs a pub on the banks of the thames , having just discovered an old valuable unpublished manuscript by charles dickens , and has a heart of gold , giving sandwiches away to such pathetic creatures as an old tramp beachcomber ( derek jacobi ) . sadie ' s murder attracts mike to the role of detective journalism and with the help of policewoman kate ( julie cox ) he begins to tie the investigation to clues he finds in reading the dickens manuscript . disrupting the flow of this rather simplistic story is the use of flashbacks to dickens ' time as dickens ( again derek jacobi ) narrates a rather personal story of peculiar murders . the parallel between stories and the cross casting among actors may have worked in another ' s hands , but the finessing of this kind of venture escapes writer / director brendan foley . he draws his story to a close ( at long last ) with a tired hollywoodesque ending . 

in addition to jones , jacobi , cox , and day , the film somehow attracted the attention of vanessa redgrave , jason flemyng , ph moriarty and mel smith : their contributions are minimal but happily distracting . this is a flimsy bit of treacle leaving the viewer wondering how films of this quality ever find funding . grady harp in the 50 ' s , a gay photographer called bob mizer ( daniel macivor ) founded an agency of male models , releasing a muscle magazine called " physique pictorial " and movie of men , and many of the models became prostitutes . " beefcake " shows the rise and fall of this pervert . 

alternating footages from the 50 ' s , testimony of many models and bob mizer himself in the present days , the director thom fitzgerald used this subterfuge to show naked men and lots of penis along 93 minutes running time , in a complete bad taste and very silly crap . i have never heard anything about this morally corrupt bob mizer and i do not know what amg is . in my opinion , only gay and very specific audiences might like the theme of this boring and pretentious movie . my vote is two . 

title ( brazil ) : " carne fresca " ( " fresh meat " )  i would agree with another viewer who wrote that this movie recalls the offbeat melanie griffith / jeff daniels comedy , " something wild , " in which a rather eccentric free-spirit hooks up with a conservative and very orderly young man , and the two pose as a couple and basically , her personality gradually has an effect on him . he looses up and learns to enjoy their short-lived tryst . that is exactly what happens here , except insert convenient store-robbing eccentric , alex ( rosanna arquette ) in melanie griffith ' s role , and super-cautious teen , lincoln ( the name is no coincidence , played by devon gummersall ) in jeff daniel ' s part . this movie even shares the same twist and abrupt genre change where the creepy , violent boyfriend suddenly shows up in the end and things end up quite badly . only , here , instead of it being ray liotta playing a throwback to 1950s film goons , it ' s peter greene . 

the story is about a teenage kid who is in his own little world . he has some sort of fascination with death following his brother ' s suicide , and his parents have disconnected , too , behaving quite strangely ( the mother is convinced christmas will be arriving shortly , despite it being august ) . then , on a night out with the " guys " ( one of whom is played by jason hervey of the wonder years ) trying to buy them beer , he runs into alex who decides to kidnap him and his friends car ( with his permission of course ) , and they take off for mini-adventure across the deserts of the west coast , robbing convenient stores in robin hood sort of fashion and of course , indulging in the routine self-discovery as each asks more about the other ' s life . but , alex has left behind a partner in her trade of theft , and he isn ' t going away easily . although , we ' re not consistently reminded of him or anything as in repetitive flashback or cutting over to his point of view . at least this much was done cleverly . 

 ' do me a favor ' ( aka trading favors ) , is a mostly underdeveloped story of criminal mischief and self-discovery that lags quite a bit for the first half of the film , but delivers the goods a little to late once alex and lincoln arrive at her home out in the middle of nowhere . by the time the filmmakers give you enough stimulation , the film is unfortunately , almost over . i would recommend that if this is the sort of story you ' re in the mood for , and despite rosanna arquette always giving a good performance ( even in a poorly written film ) , i would still recommend catching this in its best form , " something wild . "  what i liked best about this flick was the chance to see joan woodbury , who awe-struck me as one of the several beauties in the charles boyer classic " algiers " , in a leading role . she does well as rita , an orphan who rises to make good as a lady crime boss . her ascent to the top reminds me of joan crawford ' s characters , e . g . mildred pierce , who realize their ambitions by fierce determination and willpower . if you ' re looking for a film noir classic , better look elsewhere . at several points , it ' s difficult to know where this story is going . i first got the impression that it was going to encompass rita ' s plot for revenge against the father and son who tricked her into taking the rap for a drunk driving death perpetrated by the playboy son . but payback time ended up being only a minor point , and a springboard to the somewhat confusing second part of the film , where rita becomes increasingly involved in city corruption . anyway , it ' s only 72 minutes , so a second viewing should clear up any haziness . my copy is from a platinum box set called " mobster movies " . the picture quality is good , but the soundtrack sucks , constantly skipping fragments of dialog . there are eight films in the $ 5 . 50 box , making each movie a fair 69 cents . look for anne archer ' s father , john archer , as rita ' s childhood friend bob . alan ladd doesn ' t get much screen time . it ' s definitely joan woodbury ' s picture .  role-reversal remake of 1942 ' s " the major and the minor " has jerry lewis stepping into the part originally played by ginger rogers , but unfortunately this anemic outing is missing a lot more than just ginger . lewis attempts to pass for a child when boarding a train ; he ' s successful , but the deception leads to a string of comic and romantic confusions . sidney sheldon adapted the screenplay , tossing in musical moments for dean martin ( playing yet another in his stable of second-bananas ) and a jewel-robbery subplot ( which is dire ) . diana lynn , who played the wily teenager in the original film , plays lewis ' love-interest here . she ' s cute ; jerry isn ' t . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  stunning blonde natasha henstridge is the young , not-so-grieving widow in the mansion on the hill , telling her story to a tv reporter in monroeville , virginia . and among the community ' s well-heeled horsey-set , she ' s suspected of involvement in the death of her older husband . that ' s james brolin , trusting as a babe-in-arms . flashback teledrama made in canada , based on an article that appeared in vanity fair magazine . it must be true ! whatever , it ' s far more romance than mystery , and a very familiar tale . leggy species star henstridge as a gold-digging hospice nurse ? it could happen , i guess . and it ' s good to see brolin in a sizeable role after his titchy turn in antwone fisher , even if he doesn ' t make it to the end of the picture . the end of the picture ? he doesn ' t even make it to the beginning of the picture . which is why flashbacks were invented , of course .  the story line of a man ' s love for an innocent baby he finds with a malformed face and on the opposite side of the world a shallow self centered " valley girl " who shares a birth date with her and ends up making a big difference in both of there lives . what a great and worthy story line . but in this telling the screen writing and / or directing and / or editing is so poor as to take most of the joy out of the story . linda hamilton ' s character goes from understanding mom to wicked witch and back faster than a speeding bullet , and for what purpose ? conflict , conflict , conflict , at the drop of a hat . katie ( the california girl ) and her boyfriend , katie ' s mom and everybody , including the poor lady at the airport check-in counter , lin ' s adopted father , who is the nicest , most considerate man alive , and his wife and biological son , all in constant conflict . i really wanted to enjoy a heartwarming story , but the only thing that made me smile was when all the hate and fighting were over . there were too many unexplained or illogical events , many of which don ' t add to the story . my wife and i kept looking at each other and asking ourselves how such a good cast and what should be a great story , could be crapped up so badly .  i guess only a selected number of audience members really had any interest in watching how a male hustler in new york operates but i ' d be willing to bet that even these brave souls were turned off by the irritating patchwork technique and deliberately muffled sound recording on display here ; the fact that these inherent ' defects ' were a direct result of the film ' s low-budget / underground / experimental nature is , i ' d say , beside the point . anyway , for those so inclined , the film features extensive male nudity and joe dallesandro , understandably , became an underground Â and gay Â icon ! 

the episodic structure showing the day-to-day routine of the hustler protagonist offers a couple of mildly interesting scenes : his meeting with ( and eventually posing for ) an eccentric elderly artist ; the one where dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual line of work and delineates his particular modus operandi to a couple of prospective ' colleagues ' including perhaps the unlikeliest of hustlers Â a bespectacled nerd ! perhaps mercifully , the film ran for only 89 minutes against the imdb ' s claim that its complete length is 105 ( but the latter could well be a mistake ) ! 

i had watched a few other of warhol ' s ' movies ' and this one is decidedly not as satisfying as the most tolerable example i ' ve run into yet , bad ( 1977 ) , and only slightly better than the likes of my hustler ( 1965 ) which were mostly a strain to sit through . the fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy did not augur well but , as the saying goes , you gotta to do what you gotta do and the other two ' chapters ' had to follow in quick succession . . . 

despite my generally negative reaction to it , flesh is nevertheless still valuable as a 1960s time capsule and as a prototype of the underground scene of that era , both cinematically and in real life . for the record , an image of dallesandro from this film adorns the sleeve of the smiths ' self-titled 1984 debut album and transsexual candy darling ( who appears here rather unremarkably ) was immortalized in " candy says " , the opening track of the velvet underground ' s eponymous 1969 album . although the latter band is my all-time favorite , and one of the reasons for this is that , through their sheerly unique and ground-breaking music , they described a lifestyle so utterly different from my own , this is truly a case where i ' d much rather experience something aurally instead of visually !  after his widower father dies in a horsing accident , young tom burlinson ( as jim craig ) is left to manage his australian " snowy river " farm , with only wizened , peg-legged prospector kirk douglas ( as spur ) to help . times are hard , so mr . burlinson goes to work for mr . douglas ' wealthy , silver-haired brother rancher " mr . harrison " ( also played by kirk douglas ) . when a big job comes up , the silver-haired ( older ? ) douglas feels burlinson is too young and inexperienced to go along ; so , burlinson stays behind , and falls in love with the boss ' daughter , sigrid thornton ( as jessica harrison ) . 

the least satisfactory aspect of director george miller ' s " the man from snowy river " is a weak storyline . observe , for example , the " jessica is lost " sequence of events . the damsel gets lost in one of those " freak " storms , while running away . her worried father rounds up a posses of drunk men to find her , after predicting bad weather . damsel " jessica " rolls herself on to the edge of a conveniently appearing cliff . father and the suddenly sober men don ' t check burlinson ' s farm . hero burlinson discovers the damsel . after building a fire , he decides to kiss her . 

the " romance " is played too innocently for as obvious an attracted man and woman as burlinson and ms . thornton . to make matters worse , the douglas brothers have a " dark history " which is revealed before any mystery is built up regarding the matter . the main attraction , herein , is the australian scenery . 

 * * * * the man from snowy river ( 1982 ) george miller ~ tom burlinson , kirk douglas , sigrid thornton it ' s exactly what the title tells you . . . an island inhabited by fishmen . shipwrecked doctor claudio cassinelli and crew land on the island , they ' re either picked off by the fishmen or roped into working for treasure hunting lunatic richard johnson . cassinelli discovers that johnson , who believes he ' s found the lost city of atlantis , has been keeping disgraced scientist joseph cotten and his daughter barbara bach hostage for 15 years so the fishmen can uncover a treasure trove beneath the sea . cotten , of course , is a complete madman . bach and cassinelli have great chemistry . this insanity was directed by sergio martino and is not , surprisingly , without merit . it ' s fast paced , reasonably well acted and the fishmen look pretty convincing ( though it ' s unlikely anyone could prove that these things don ' t look like actual fishmen ) . there ' s an excellent music score by luciano michelini .  not being a particular fan of westerns , i watched this primarily because i wanted to see lucille ball in something other than an " i love lucy " or " lucy show " type of role . here she plays christine larson , owner of a saloon in the arizona territory in 1868 who ' s about to be married to the unscrupulous local indian agent ( dean jagger . ) ball ' s performance was ok - nothing really more than that ; she didn ' t blow me away . it succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what i ' m accustomed to seeing her in - there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for , although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout . ( a typical funny line - " there ' s two ways to deal with women - and no one knows either one of them ! " ) i didn ' t find the story all that compelling , although i appreciated that the indians were shown as the victims of the indian agent . there ' s typical shootout action and a lot of horses - your typical western in other words . as to christine - we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up ; it ' s just a question of how she ' s going to get there . if you like westerns , this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in . if you ' re not big on the genre , this will be lacking . i ' m not big on the genre . 3 / 10 i have loved the book " a little princess " for most of my life , and was very excited that there was a movie . but i was appalled at this adaptation . not only is the acting wooden , and the plot a convoluted mish mash of various incidents in the book , but the theme is all wrong . the real theme of the story should be that a girl can be a princess only when she behaves like one , as sara does when she gives 5 of her 6 buns to a beggar child , even when she herself is very hungry . the theme of the movie seems to be that all girls are princesses , which cheapens sara ' s actions considerably , and seems more like it should be written on a hallmark card than applied to this story . 

there are many other things wrong with this movie- too many to list , but here are just a few of the larger ones : this story should be set in britian in the mid 1800s , not america during the first world war . miss minchen is harsh to sara from the start , making her actions when sara is left penniless much less startling than they would be if she was syrupy sweet at the beginning , as she is supposed to be . nowhere is it mentioned that becky is black . sara ' s father does * not * come back , he is dead . it is his closest friend , and collaborator in the diamond mines who finds sara , and restores her to her proper place . in fact , the diamond mines are not even mentioned at all , though they are the source of sara ' s wealth . 

all through everything that sara has faced , she always acts like a princess , giving what she can , and forgiving those who hurt her . she would never have called lavinia a " snotty two faced bully " . such a thing is completely out of character for her , and undermines the entire philosophy that she is to be well behaved no matter what . 

this is by far the worst adaptation of a book to the screen that i have ever seen ( with the notable exceptions of " ella enchanted " , and " anne of green gables the continuing story " ) the plot of the book is wonderful , and skillfully written , so i do not understand why the director felt that it needed to be changed to make it interesting . i would suggest that anyone wishing to know this story should watch the 1987 version , which is far superior . or better still , read the book . it will be more worth your time than the hour and a half wasted on this version on the movie .  excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal . it is rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because i try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing . in the case of " full ride " , the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story ; i was too busy ( during first and only viewing ) alternating between laughter and nausea . 

fortunately for most individual members of the cast , pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak , the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting . riley smith and meredith monroe are at least well matched physically , finding common ground in looking far too old for the credible age of their characters . 

unfortunately the script requires especially intense and convincing performances to portray their characters which just exposes smith and monroe ' s staggering lack of talent . on the positive side , they know enough to not look directly into the camera and they do not stutter . 

better to have used a less attractive pair who could physically pass for the proper age . the basic story is not particularly original , just another variation on " an officer and a gentleman " , but it would have provided a nice showcase for a talented pair of " teenage " actors . 

then again , what do i know ? i ' m just a child .  boring as hell and kind of a chick flick . 

it ' s the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement , the romantic nature of a one night stand , and the uncertainty and pitfalls of true love . 

many of the story ' s motifs are reminiscent of other recent kst movies ( e . g . the english patient ) , but have far less appeal . 

after the first half-hour i started checking my watch , wondering if i ' d make it home in time to catch leno on tv . 

i passed up " gladiator " to see this ! ? !  this belabored and sloppy spy melodrama featuring two buffoonish ( one idealistic , one drug addled ) california kids dealing secrets to the kgb never seems to get enough steam up to sustain any tension and suspense before it dies a very slow death over two hours later . john schlesinger ' s finished product gives the impression that he was asleep in his director ' s chair most of the time as the film lags and the actors sleep walk , save for the highly annoying over the top performance of sean penn . 

childhood altar boys and friends chris ( tim hutton ) and daulton ( penn ) devise a plan to sell secrets to the kgb when chris lands a job that allows him access to top secret government materials . disillusioned by what he sees as us meddling in foreign affairs the idealistic chris and the drug hungry daulton make contact with the russians and begin to funnel them classified materials . when chris decides he wants out things begin to unravel at a lackadaisical pace . 

the eighties were not kind to distinguished director john schlesinger . in the 60s and 70s he had a series of critically acclaimed films in both england and america but then came honky tonk freeway in 1981 and it marked the beginning of the end . the falcon and the snowman more or less put a lid on it . lacking the suspense of marathon man and the quality performances ( hoffman voight , christie , jackson , finch , olivier ) he had coaxed from leads in the past falcon goes in circles most of the way . 

sean penn chews scenery from start to finish in such an obnoxious fashion you find yourself encouraging his torturers to do more to him . tim hutton is governed by his limited acting chops and most of his scenes show a need for more rehearsal time . lori singer as hutton ' s girlfriend plays it mute most of the way with schlesinger content to film her vapid expressions . when she does emote you understand why . only david suchet as the kgb handler with a piercing eyed introspective presence and restraint acquits himself well .  this is a silly spoof of private eye thrillers as a novelist ( michael cain ) is called upon to ' ghostwrite ' an autobiography of a colorful , waning hollywood star ( mickey rooney ) . at times silliness becomes obnoxious . this is not cain at his best . rooney is way over the top . notable support from lizabeth scott , lionel stander and the comely nadia cassini . not easy to watch .  the other day i showed my boyfriend a great movie , stand by me , a movie i have shown to many people and they absolutely adored it , but for some odd reason he didn ' t like it . he lends me a movie called backdraft and he tells me that he ' s shown it to many people and they loved it , instead i hated this movie . i don ' t think i ' ve hated a movie so much in a while , how this movie has even a 6 . 6 rating is beyond me . i couldn ' t keep up with the five million stories here : billy baldwin becoming a fire man , the random sibling rivalry , the random love story ( s ) , the who ' s being an arson story , the investigator , the fire who has a personality of it ' s own . i just have a problem that this movie can ' t keep up with all these stories , they didn ' t balance out well enough make the film interesting . i would have just preferred if this movie was about being a firefighter or the investigator and how he came to be one or what it is exactly he does and why . 

the movie tells the story of a group of chicago firefighters , two brothers . stephen " bull " mccaffrey , the elder brother , is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights . brian , the younger brother quit the fire fighting academy school several years before , then embarking on a number of other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter . he is looked down on by his elder brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a fire fighter . donald " shadow " rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession . he is called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections . . martin swayzak is an alderman on the city council . he has obvious hopes of being elected to mayor , but has had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department . many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that he has made are endangering the lives of the firefighters . however , swayzak is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffectual after firemen are repeatedly being killed in blazes . 

i just couldn ' t get into this movie , i don ' t know how anyone else could , it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed firefighters all wrong . i loved how they had every action clichÃ© in the book to match this action flick . i just felt also like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles , donald sutherland , great actor , but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the upcoming talent at the time . i know ron was going for great quality , but i think him casting such huge actors in small roles was a mistake for this film . i even had to joke my way through while watching this movie commenting how the doctor in the background was probably kevin spacey . the fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there , i didn ' t enjoy it and honestly wouldn ' t recommend it to people , i ' ll stick to the recommendations in my relationship from this point on . 

2 / 10 sorry to disagree with you , but i found the dkc series to be quite engaging . so much so that i invested in the snes system and my own copies of the games . this is , mind you , almost ten years after the initial release of dkc 1 . the graphics were ground-breaking for their time , the first vector graphics games for home systems . the music and characters are all memorable , and the games brought myself and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment . true , the second game was better than the first , and the third was perhaps lacking the ' edge ' of the second installment . but all three offered different play , and i enjoy them to this day . by the way , i ' m old enough to remember when there were no video games whatsoever ( and tvs were black and white ! ) .  the comic strip featured actors from ' the young one ' s ' - a student based sitcom from the 80 ' s . comic strip features included parodies of westerns , ' the famous 5 ' , and the professionals - all a lot funnier than this . having said that alexei sayle puts in a good turn as a traffic cop with ambition and the soundtrack features great music from the era . 5 / 10 star rating : * * * * * saturday night * * * * friday night * * * friday morning * * sunday night * monday morning 

old detroit is back , with the giant omni consumer corporation continuing to swallow everything in it ' s path as construction of the new delta city continues and a new menace to contend with in the shape of cain , a cruel drug lord with delusions of christ-likeness , peddling a deadly new addictive on the streets called nuke . as he continues to struggle with the memories of his former life haunting him , the tin plated hero sets out to bring this villain down- only to wind up getting chopped into pieces of scrap metal . with robocop out of action , a ruthless ocp business-woman proposes plans for her new android- a stomping , snarling beast of a machine that needs an equally nasty test subject to power it- which cain fits perfectly . after a brief glitch in his system , robo returns to bring justice to the streets and settle the score with cain . 

the original robocop is a film that always manages to astound you each time you watch it , no matter how many times you ' ve seen it , one of those films that just can ' t be done again . that said , it ' s not surprising a sequel was made- it ' s even less surprising that that sequel really pales compared to the original . empire strikes back director irvin kirschner has crafted an unpleasant , slightly incoherent and overlong film that can ' t capture the magic of the first film , no matter how hard it tries . and it certainly does that , the funny ads from the first film running none stop , the corporate satire aiming to be that bit sharper and the action roaring as fast and furious as before , but with blood / gore even meaner than the first film . the first film earned a name for some nasty , blood-soaked violence ( including a man ' s genitals being blown off and a man being blasted to pieces ) but while that was more memorable the violence / gore on display here is of a more sadistic and gratuitous nature , with a very unpleasant and mean-spirited tone to it . 

but overall , the film leaves you with a feeling of general apathy- why are you watching this when you could be watching the original again instead ? * *  while i ' m normally a big fan of john turturro ' s work as an actor and director , illuminata is a great disappointment . although the film has some charming moments , overall it falls flat . worst of all , the film is confusing . where is the movie set ? italy or an italian troupe in new york ? why bother making a historical film if it fails to convey a setting ? if you want to see a well-made , inspiring historical film also about theater , go see tim robbins ' the cradle will rock . this movie has many pluses , including a fine performance by john turturro .  although the story is good and portrayals what i expected of sam elliot my dvd copy contained almost unbearable synchronization problems . the dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the lip movement throughout the whole film . 

i would therefore be very careful in purchasing any dvd of the film without checking for the problem . 

i would also follow the recommended censors classifications particularly in relation to language and drug usage . 

this film could become a silent classic cop movie and with the above cautionary notes i can recommend it to prospective viewers less than two hundred and fifty years ago , the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire across the pages of maritime history . this is the story of a buccaneer captain whose name for one short year struck terror in the hearts of seafarers and merchants from the ports of the caribbean to the trading houses of london . . . . . 

hmm , that opening to the film sounds like we are in for one hell of a swashbuckling , pillaging , ripper of a movie doesn ' t it ? well it ' s not . tho it ' s not totally without value as a curio piece . out of 20th century fox , anne of the indies is adapted by philip dunne & arthur caesar from a short story written by herbert ravenel sass . direction is by jacques tourneur , the score is by franz waxman and harry jackson is providing the technicolor photography . jean peters is in the titular title role of anne {aka captain providence} and support comes from louis jourdan , debra paget , herbert marshall , thomas gomez & james robertson justice . 

originally meant to be be based on true life pirate anne bonny , the film ultimately turns out to be a tale of a woman seeking identity , and finding herself , in the predominantly male led world of piracy and sea based shenanigans . filled with clichÃ©s and over familiar set pieces , the film also suffers from a cast that is largely misfiring . peters gives it a right good go , and paget lights up the screen with effervescent beauty . while robertson justice , although underused , actually looks the part and doesn ' t overact like the rest of the male cast does . some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings , purely because it ' s tourneur in the directing chair . but there is no depth here , this is merely a job for tourneur , a professional one granted , but its thinly plotted and actually lacking swash to go with the buckle in the action stakes . 

disposable at best . 4 / 10 wakayama tomisaburo ' s portrayal of fugitive ex-kaishakunin ogami itto felt entirely natural . his demeanor , his voice , his appearance- all of it spoke to dislodgement . when he entered a space i , as well as characters on the screen , could feel he didn ' t belong there and that his determination to be there spelled trouble . 

i read somewhere that mr . wakayama actually took kendo ( japanese swordsmanship ) training and that would explain his comfort with the katana , which showed magnificently in every cutfest . if you watch the movies , from the moment he draws to the moment he sheaths the sword you feel as though you were witnessing something inevitably ugly . he ' d even spin the katana quickly to flick off the blood before sheathing it and it would happen in an effortless instant . 

nakamura kinnosuke ' s rendition comes across as a rendition . it feels as though he were trying too hard to be someone else or tell someone else ' s story . as a result , every time i tried to engage i ' d lose my grip because he didn ' t seem to have a firm grip on the role , himself . as though it were awkward for him . 

the swordsmanship in the tv series was entirely old-school hollyweird , too . camera cuts to disguise mr . nakamura ' s awkwardness with the katana , slow action , targets sitting still , etc . extremely bad , from a viewer ' s perspective . there was a moment in the episode the castle wall attack when mr . nakamura drew his sword like a child . it was embarrassing . he handled it as though it were heavy ! i almost fell off my chair . 

and let ' s be frank : the story is about an excellent swordsman . period . swordsmanship is an issue . 

realism isn ' t , however : the swordplay in the movies was excellent and manga-like , as was intended , i ' m sure . ( the baby cart was outfitted with a cluster of automatic , rapid-fire muskets operated by a 3 year old ? yes . . . manga-style . ) it ' s how the story seamlessly weaves historical cultural accuracy into , basically , superhero fantasy that makes the movies captivating . ( read yoshikawa eiji ' s musashi [ % historical legend] % ! ) i couldn ' t really sit through the tv series episodes . they just felt cheap . see the movies first and you ' ll know what i ' m talking about .  bridget fonda is the sexually satisfied wife of handsome hart bochner . one afternoon she comes home , calls him " honey " , and quietly fixes him a drink , only to find that he ' s sulking . minutes go by while she compliantly puts up with his frowning silence . suddenly , he bursts into a rage , accusing her of infidelity in the complete absence of any reason to do so , calls her the c word , slams her head against a cabinet , slaps her around , and winds up flinging her off the second-floor balcony , breaking her hand and a couple of ribs . 

she wakes up in the hospital where , it is revealed , she is deaf , although we notice that she reads lips perfectly . that avoids all the awkwardness associated with an asl interpreter or having her squawk words in a simulacrum of language . 

all right . let me just lay out the basic plot elements . this beautiful and devoted handicapped woman is beaten by her husband , misunderstood by her elderly mother , betrayed by her sister , has her bank account emptied by unknown hands , almost raped by a fat man who accosts her in a bar , is thought to have murdered her now missing husband , and is pursued by two cops ( kiefer sutherland and steven weber ) , one of whom is interested only in justice while the other seems to dislike all women and is embarrassed by their presence . the end finds her standing alone at a deserted bus stop with a hand full of cash -- alone , tearful , but brave . 

now , a pop quiz . there is only one multiple-choice question . " this story was written by : ( a ) a man or ( b ) a woman . " not to sound sexist . one could as easily pose a scenario about a decorated military hero and trained warrior who is captured by his enemies , betrayed by his organization , beaten and tortured , escapes to exact revenge , and winds up with the woman he loves , whom he thought he ' d lost long ago . 

the direction is functional and conventional . when fonda regains consciousness in a hospital bed , we see from her point of view the faces of the anxious doctors and nurses looking down at her -- that is , at the camera -- an echo of every scene in myriad second-rate movies in which the gurney is being hurriedly wheeled down the corridor and people wearing starched white coats and festooned with stethoscopes hover over the camera . 

hart bochner has played a number of evil people in an interesting way -- some of the characters are stupid ( " die hard " ) and some are rather more than plain rude ( " and the sea will tell " ) . his virile handsomeness has a kind of evil tint to it . it would be too easy to cast him as a hero . nice , intentionally bland performance by steven weber as the dumb cop -- maybe the best in the film . 

bridget fonda is interesting too . her acting range is limited but it ' s on full display here . what makes her an object of interest is her almost stereotypical beauty . she ' s like a high school prom queen . very feminine . of course she can ' t help it if she slithers around or moves her hands so gracefully . neither can she do anything about her nose . for most of its length it ' s perfectly normal and attractive but at its very tip there is a bump outward that follows the natural flare of her nostrils . the tip of that nose is full of intrigue . 

as for the movie -- pfui .  i found dominion to be a lousy attempt to continue the success of the story . the original movie was a story about evil , and how it can infiltrate our lives . 

schrader ' s version is lacking in evil . viewers do not get an overwhelming sense of dread , fear , or even foreboding . harlin ' s version offers evident evil , shows violations of the church ' s sanctity , and builds a convincing story that is plausible , given father merrin ' s background . schrader ' s story leaves one wondering exactly what happened . dominion does not evoke the emotions of the viewers to empathize with father merrin , and leaves the viewer wondering exactly why he was troubled in the first place . 

anyone interested in seeing a sequel which lives up to the original should see exorcist : the beginning .  before going any further , i have to admit that i only saw the first episode of this show . if i had the time , i might have considered watching it every week , if only to see how the season played out . however , it was very clear to me from the beginning that martha stewart ' s version of " the apprentice " just doesn ' t " fit in . " martha stewart made a career of being a happy homemaker , a domestic diva of the likes of oprah winfrey and julia child . it was only since her scandalous legal troubles and subsequent incarceration that her public image began to reflect the true roughness of her character . sure , she was compelling for a while , and this entire series poses the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business . does she have to come off as cold and tough ? shouldn ' t she ? 

but the truth was , by the time stewart came out of prison , her attempts for a public comeback , though certainly warranted , were never going to seize viewers ' interest for very long . perhaps a true comeback would have worked had she returned home peacefully and waited a year or so after her often mocked ankle bracelet was removed . instead , she frantically dove into overkill with 2 series at once , the other being her syndicated daytime series martha , much like her old show , but more mainstream , with famous guests like bette midler . of course , even at her peak stewart was never mainstream , so it ' s too much to ask that american audiences immediately accept her foray into reality tv . maybe america wants stewart to make a comeback on her own rather than be the basis for it . 

the show was basically a tired retread of trump ' s " apprentice , " which still holds my interest , depending on the tasks , the cast , and trump ' s firing decisions ( often controversial - likely for that reason ) . the letter bit was certainly not clichÃ© but obnoxious in the least . the fact that stewart never says , " you ' re fired ! " - mentioned in the message board on this site - is particularly distressing . producer mark burnett should be admired for dealing with stewart ' s jail time honestly while trying to make her a hero , but the truth is that anyone watching can tell that she ' s basically trying to put on a show of being this nice businesswoman . again never mainstream , stewart lacks the agreeability and identifiability of oprah winfrey and the admirable , charismatic " toughness " of donald trump . yes , this can be a gender-biased assessment of her character , but i mean it to be more about the nature of her business . 

it comes as no shock that stewart has been fired , but i wonder if they really always intended it to only last for one season ?  interesting and short television movie describes some of the machinations surrounding jay leno ' s replacing carson as host of the tonight show . film is currently very topical given the public drama surrounding conan o ' brien and jay leno . 

the film does a good job of sparking viewers ' interest in the events and showing some of the concerns of the stakeholders , particularly of the nbc executives . the portrayal of ovitz was particularly compelling and interesting , i thought . 

still , many of the characters were only very briefly limned or touched upon , and some of the acting seemed perfunctory . nevertheless , an interesting story .  undoubtedly , the least among the spaghetti westerns i ' ve been watching lately : basically a low-brow rip-off of leone ' s the good , the bad and the ugly ( 1966 ) with three disparate characters outwitting one another ( and occasionally forming shaky alliances ) in their search for hidden gold . leonard maltin rated it a bomb ; while it ' s harmless enough , it ' s also totally routine and , fatally , the three main roles are stereotypes , that is to say , uninteresting : eddie byrnes is a bank employee with ideas regarding his consignment being transported by train ; gilbert roland is the " legendary " but ageing mexican bandit ( his frequent lapses into spanish when excited are quite corny ! ) who , apparently , is still irresistible to women ; george hilton as an enigmatic bounty hunter tries too hard to emulate clint eastwood ' s man with no name figure . director castellari - whom i saw at the italian b-movie retrospective held during the 2004 venice film festival , where he came off as the most pompous of the cult movie directors present ! - shows little genuine feeling for the western ( on the strength of two above-average franco nero efforts in the genre , i ordered his collaboration with castellari keoma [1976] . . . i ' m keeping my fingers crossed now ! ) and the film ' s tongue-in-cheek approach is equally lamentable .  and one only , in my opinion . 

that reason is margaret leighton . she is a wonderful actress , on-stage as well as on the screen . we have few chances to see her , though . i think that ' s especially true in the united states . 

here she plays a sympathetic role . not only that but she is also very pretty and meant to be something of a bombshell . 

walter pigeon does not hold up the tradition of drummond performers . he is always reliable but he ' s not much fun . he ' s not a rascal or a knave . consequently , this seemed to me a talky endeavor with little action or suspense . but check it out for leighton .   " i haven ' t laughed this hard since granny got caught in the wringer , " says one of the potheads in this hilarious quasi-spoof of all those val lewton and george a . romero walking-dead movies we have come to love ( or loath , depending on your personal taste ) through the years . 

in this story , a young actor pair play a ghoulish prank on the rest of their troupe after , one spooky night , they visit a cemetery island . their artistic director , alan , pretends to bring the dead back to life by conducting a highly stylized ritual . 

way too much screen time is misspent ; the amateur dialog includes lame witticisms , melodrama and other kinds of unnecessary filler commentaries ( and can ' t alan stop that irritating laughter . . . way too much ! ) . once the action kicks in ( which comes close to the end of this film ) , it ' s worth the wait . 

i saw this one on a late-night , local station television program that ran films very much like this one . . . only this one scared me at the age of 13 . . . but then again , you might laugh your way through it , until the bitter end . . . . . . which is probably the reason , nowadays , why very few people still wear striped hip-huggers .  i ' s a big struggle . as a story that is surreal , this movie could ' ve been great ( as great as it is rated by some here ) , but mixed with the acting ( director and relatives playing major roles , due to financial reasons i reckon ) found in here . . . although calling this acting , is not only a stretch of that word , it ' s giving it a new meaning ! a whole new meaning ! 

if you are into surreal movies ( there are some that i do like actually , see the japanese strange circus for example ) , you might be able to overlook the flaws ( see above ) and enjoy this more . there are great ideas here , after all ! many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes , but while watching this ( with a group of friends ) almost all of us , just couldn ' t stop laughing . . . not the intention of the director of course ! again , everyone has their own liking , as one can see by the high rating of this movie , but i could only recommend the movie if you ' re aware of the work that alejandro jodorowsky has done and / or are a fan of his !  team spirit is maybe made by the best intentions , but it misses the warmth of " all stars " ( 1997 ) by jean van de velde . most scenes are identic , just not that funny and not that well done . the actors repeat the same lines as in " all stars " but without much feeling .  as a devotee of ms . frank , i remember being so excited that the play was being re-made for tv . that is , until i saw it . . . this film is a prime example of how important casting is , and how directing plays such an important part in creating the sense of purpose . the casting of any central role is crucial to a production of this sort . . . shows like auntie mame and man of la mancha are totally dependent on the charisma of the lead actor . and in the cast of this movie , the whole thing is destroyed by the atrocious casting of melissa gilbert in the lead role . there is not one single moment that ms . gilbert even comes close to inhabiting the sensitive , mature spirit of anne- ms . gilbert is " white-bread " throughout the movie . . . the only time i was close to tears was during the reading of anne ' s most haunting line : " i still believe , in spite of everything , that people are truly good at heart " - this is spoken by ms . gilbert so rushed , so lacking in conviction , that she might has well burped and achieved the same effect . film and dance legend marge champion was the dialogue coach for this production- she should have refunded her salary ! despite ms . gilbert ruining diary , other performances are satisfactory for the most part- special kudos to joan plowright as edith , scott jacoby as peter and clive reville as mr . dussell . maxmillian schell does not have the deep-rooted soul and spirit as otto as does the creator of the role on stage and film ( joseph schildkraut ) , but he ' s okay . doris roberts and james coco as the van danns are relatively superficial in their parts- they ' re shrill and bombastic , but again , only on the surface . this could be due to the fact that the pacing of the project is way too rushed ( as noted in previous postings ) - this film clocks in 45 minutes shorter than the film version- the difference owing to the pauses for dramatic effect , which apparently is necessary to propagate the appropriate mood for the story . this is not mandatory viewing , especially for youngsters learning about anne frank for the first time- stick to the original film version , and or even better , the tv production of anne frank : the true story starring ben kingsley , which is the closest thing to capturing the heartbreak and reality of anne ' s situation ever filmed ! note : especially appalling is the fact that melora marshall , who plays anne ' s sister margot , is not included in the opening credits along with all the other members of the secret annex . . . she ' s listed in the post-credits along with the actors playing miep and mr . kraler . if i was ms . marshall , i would have sued !   " what symbolism ! " exclaimed a woman as we exited the theater after viewing the polish brother ' s paean to ingmar bergman . some symbolism is there all right . but not much . " northfork " adds up to some fine acting weakened by dreary cinematography that fails to make any coherent statement and a muddled story that irritates rather than enthralls . 

northfork is a town facing extinction after a new hydroelectric dam goes into operation . it ' s the early to middle 1950s and a squad of identically dressed state agents , all looking as if they had just answered a casting call for " the untouchables , " have the job of relocating recalcitrant dwellers who fail to appreciate both their immediate peril as well as the proffered bounty for moving . an exciting anti-development movie is always a possibility but let ' s get real : rural electrification is one of the greatest advances in bringing decent living conditions and a boosted economy in american history . dams can be built without forced relocation ? not in this country . 

but this film is less about the plight of homeowners than it is a fantastical creation of a dying young boy ' s escapist imagination . nick nolte is the priest who tends to the lad and much of what he says might have been interesting if the sound was clear enough to hear . 

alternating between the black-suited evacuation agents ( working for " lakefront " land when the dam creates that valuable acreage ) and a phantasmagorical collection of weirdos , the film develops neither theme coherently or even interestingly . 

the cinematography is poor . a washed out , subdued and depressive color permeates the whole film to little dramatic purpose . there is no reason for this vast terrain to be depicted so bleakly . indeed , a contrast between largely untouched natural beauty and the massive and grim solidity of the evolving dam and power plants would have been very effective . 

4 / 10 .  i agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries , and agree that it does have its pros , not only its cons . for example , the original film manage to truncate much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage , including the discovery of gurney halleck and the love affair of paul atreides and chani , which , on reading the novel , is a travesty , probably born of the studio cutting shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes . this was one of the great failings of the original film , and the miniseries , to its credit , does include many of the original plot lines that were cut out of the lynch film due to the expansive nature of the herbert novel . 

however , this in itself is a double edged sword . rather than complete a text-to-celluloid transfer of the novel , the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines , absent from the original novel . similarly , although this is surely a " fuller " account of the storyline of dune , it is also a break from the originals heart and soul & main vision - that of prophecy . where are the internal monologues that characterize herbert ' s writing and demonstrate what the many different characters are thinking , without the need to suddenly switch viewpoint , or expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues ? gone . so much of the original agony of paul ' s decision to choose the jihad or death , the choice to fulfill the prophecy or swing away from it , surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself ( and one which captivates people who are far from science fiction fans ) is missing . 

without prophecy , what is the point of dune ? it is simply a more educated and learned version of farscape or andromeda . how sad that this is all we are provided with . lynch ' s film was flawed , yes . but a flawed film could lead to a correction by another film-maker , taking on some of the best points of lynch ' s film-making and rejecting some of the more overblown aspects of the style whilst restoring the storyline . now this story shall probably never be translated to film again , and this i find heartrending .  i decided to watch this movie because i ' d not seen carol lombard before in any movie . i ' m sorry it had to be this one because , quite frankly , this is a dog Â and even with jimmy stewart and charles coburn , both of whom were great actors . 

the problem with the film is simple : it tries to put too much , too quickly , in to a story about a young lawyer ( john manson played by stewart ) who marries jane ( played by lombard ) within an hour of meeting her . what ' s that clichÃ© ? marry in haste , repent at leisure . . . 

in short , the story is a series of episodes that show the couples ' worsening financial status , their troubles with john ' s live-in mother , their struggles to pay the bills , john ' s diminished status at the office , the arrival of their baby son , john jnr ( unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother ) , the couples ' angst about their marriage , the baby ' s sickness which worsens , thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot ( in a fierce storm ) to bring a special serum to save the child , and finally john being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm . 

how many more clichÃ©d situations could the writers include ? maybe mother dying soon after ? there wasn ' t much comedy ; the drama was lacklustre , at best ; the dialog was painful to hear . only the acting of the four main players was adequate . 

this was the period at the end of the great depression with the usa coming out of its long downturn Â during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie . 

so , it made sense for selznick to reaffirm good ol ' home spun american values of family , relationships , heroism , perseverance , and initiative Â all against the backdrop of the " average " american family . who better to use than jimmy stewart and carol lombard ? 

and , it should be noted that the film was released in early 1939 ; so , it was planned in 1938 Â soon after the usa began to get production going for the coming world war ii . hence , this sort of film was a great booster for the general public , at that time , many of who would soon have to join england in war . as many here would know , hollywood and washington formed an uneasy alliance before , during and after the war . 

however , i ' m glad i saw it Â as a piece of disguised socio-political propaganda . but , i ' ll have to see other lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting range . 

as another reviewer noted : see this one just to say that you ' ve seen all of stewart ' s movies ; otherwise , don ' t bother .  martha plimpton has done some prestigious movies , working with river phoenix and harrison ford , but she was never able to expand her limited , tomboyish appeal into the same class as , say , molly ringwald . this film , which was barely released , is just an extension of her late ' 80s / early ' 90s attempts to find a screen-persona which was identifiable to moviegoers , and it represents another failure . plimpton plays a troubled young woman who finds out on her 21st birthday that she was adopted and--worse than that--was actually abandoned as an infant on her parents ' doorstep ! she sets out to find her biological mother and father , but the viewer has no clue why she ' d even want to ( would simple curiosity give her this much determination ? ) . unattractive material given sitcom handling ; it starts off on the wrong foot and never recovers . plimpton gives a sour , surly performance , but hector elizondo and mary kay place are fine as her adoptive parents . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  this film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain-top commune as free men in 17th-century brazil . the story is interesting and edifying . however , this film -- as a film -- is terrible . 

the soundtrack is not period music or tribal music . it is afro-brazilian pop music from the early 1980s . battle scenes are fought to the sounds of cheesy pop rhythms best left to the disco or bad cops dramas . admittedly , the lyrics are folk-ish tales of the slaves ' heroism . the special effects are absurd . rather than invoke the mysticism of african religion and atavistic beliefs , they merely make the film look cheap . they are completely unbelievable , and i don ' t mean merely in a sense of verisimilitude . 

life within the commune of palmares could not have been the way it is portrayed in the film . for this society , as shown in the film , is one-part kibbutz , one-part afro-pop festival . moreover , it is almost embarrassing to watch the director play upon the clichÃ©s of blacks as talented singers and dancers who simply want to be happy . he portrays daily life as a series of dance parties in which the freed slaves paint themselves bright colors and whirl around to the strains of ' 80s pop music . on the other hand , they have an abundance of beautiful food , but the viewer hardly sees any work being done . the king inveighs against private property in a hackneyed and clichÃ©d way . when a man complains that people are taking the vegetables that he has grown over many months , the king says , " what comes from the earth belongs to everyone , as the earth belongs to no one . if they need food , they have a right to take yours . " 

i am glad that i learned about this episode in history , but i am relieved that a film with such low production values and that trades upon such worn stereotypes would likely not be made today .  eleven years ago , stanley ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of edge city by finding and wearing the norse god of mischief , loki ' s mask . the mask helped bring jim carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun . everyone knew how to spell party . p-a-r-t-y . why ? cuz i gotta ! now , eleven years later , it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie " son of the mask . " someone asked director lawrence guterman why are you making this ? and he responds " cuz i gotta ! " unfortunately , that answer doesn ' t cover it because after seeing son of the mask i still left the theatre thinking , " good lord , why ? " guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film need to realize that the response given to why are you making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party . 

the son of the mask begins with otis the dog finding the infamous mask and bringing it back to his owner tim avery , a clear homage to legendary loony toons creator tex avery . tim , played by jamie kennedy , is a struggling animator who is stuck working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he aspires to one-day draw for . on the night of the company halloween party , tim puts on the mask and transforms into the mischievous , insane character that we all expect . after the party tim goes home , mask still on and conceives a child with his wife . nine months later mayhem ensues as the baby born of the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers . otis the dog , jealous of the baby ' s attention , puts on the mask and partakes in tom and jerry type mayhem to out the baby . meanwhile , loki , played by alan cumming , is in search for his mask at the orders of his father , odin . 

first off , ill admit that i do respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to the classic cartoons such as tom and jerry and loony toons , with its wile e . coyote type contraptions and the infamous dancing frog type plot . however , this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time . 

the premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly . silly is not always a bad thing , but in this movie , the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying . the characters are not fun to watch , and what ' s worse , they ' re not funny . the dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much cgi was used . one of the greatest things about the original is that while , obviously computer animation was used , so much relied on jim carrey and his exuberant style of just being . jim carrey , we were convinced , was an actual cartoon . jamie kennedy just doesn ' t have that kind of ability , a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift . the baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie . the side story of loki searching for the mask just became more and more stupefying . 

the son of the mask is a sad sad state of affairs . what i suggest is you go rent or buy the original the mask and thank the norse gods , or whoever , for bringing it to us . and will consider seeing the sequel my sacrifice as i continue to ask the infamous question " why ? " the son of the mask gets one star , although that star should be divvied up between the classic creators of loony toons and jim carrey , who will always be , in my book , the mask .  the brave one is about a new york radio show host named erica bain ( jodie foster ) . her life is a dream living in the city she grew up in and loves . she has her great fiancÃ© david ( naveen andrews ) , whom she is planning to marry . but one night while erica and david are out walking their dog , they are attacked and mugged by a group of degenerates , leaving david dead . erica recovers but is heartbroken and traumatized later on , and can barely cope with real life anymore . she buys a gun off a guy on the streets for protection . but one day she ' s shopping in a store , and a man comes in and shoots the clerk dead . it is then that erica shoots and kills this man , and she becomes a vigilante . killing anyone who tries to threaten or harm her or any others . at the same time detective mercer ( terrence howard ) is tracking down this elusive unknown killer , and in the process becomes friends with erica . erica begins to regain her sanity as she kills these violent people , but is unsure of whether or not what she ' s doing is morally right . and as her and mercer become closer , he doesn ' t even realize the unknown murderous assailant is right next to him . 

jodie foster gives a very good performance in the brave one . she portrays this type of violent , morally corrupted character brilliantly . terrence howard is also great in this movie . both have excellent chemistry together , and strengthen the film to a certain level . the brave one looks visually pristine , and conveys some brilliant camera work , but not all of it works to a great effect . the scenes where erica is absolutely traumatized and afraid to walk out her front door to face the world . the camera swayed back and forth to the sides in an almost dream-like way , and really captured the moment with essence . whereas almost every time erica killed somebody , everything just had to go slo-mo and show her facial expressions in fine detail . the slo-mo was properly used when erica committed her first murder . but why keep doing this effect almost every time she committed murder ? the camera work creates a great atmosphere in most of the film , but there a few scenes here that are just plain overkill . 

the brave one is very much about how these murders affect erica emotionally . her fiancÃ© is killed by a group of thugs , and suddenly her love of new york city is turned upside down . she realizes that there is a dark side to the beloved city , and she says so on her radio show . i don ' t completely understand this though . erica acts as if she never realized that violence can occur at night in the city , and that ' s pretty stupid . if she lived there all her life she must be either blind or very oblivious . erica also seems to be a glutton for inhumane , murderous people . she really doesn ' t even have to go look for them , they just to come to her as if they ' re begging to be shot dead for their wrong-doing . the brave one deals with the morals and proper use of violence strongly at first , and then suddenly it glorifies it . the ending is very negative , and completely immoral and inhumane . it also negates the purpose of terrence howard ' s character , which the movie spends so much time trying to evenly develop , and suddenly his morals take a u-turn . the morals in the brave one become very fractured , and just plain shatter all over the place by the end . so violence is okay ? it ' s a good thing to commit murder as long as it ' s for vengeance ? i pretty much refuse to believe that . you know why ? because i have a conscience , which this film surely lacks . it is not right to take the life of another person , no matter how bad they are , or how much you hate them . erica bain sets out to stop these evil-doers , but in the end she is no better than the horrible people she kills . 

jodie foster and terrence howard provide a lot of strength for this movie . the brave one contains a strong message , but that message is both immoral and wrong . this movie may look pretty , well acted , and intelligently strong . but it becomes pretty rotten by the end . i give the brave one a 1 . 5 out of 4 . the message is very out of line and morally incorrect , and really can ' t be saved by the good acting .  just caught " the rain people " on turner classic movies late one night . the film was released in 1969 . shirley knight stars as natalie , a long island housewife who -- exact reasons unknown -- leaves her husband and embarks on a road trip , not knowing exactly where she is going . natalie is also newly pregnant , which complicates things . along the way , she picks up a brain-damaged ex-football player " jimmy " ( james caan ) , who has been kicked out of his college and is hitchhiking . there are many twists and turns along the way between these two , as natalie struggles to take care of jimmy and she begins to realize he is mentally limited and cannot take care of himself . she is going through her own struggles , needless to say , and in no position to care for him . natalie appears to be a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown at times ; she makes some odd phone calls to her husband , who begs her to come home . natalie tries to dump jimmy several times , only to have him re-enter her life through circumstances . a young robert duvall plays a strange and troubled cop who befriends natalie . you get the sense all along that this film is going to end badly , and it does . this film is certainly uneven at times , and the script is somewhat lacking . francis ford coppola directed this , and of course he would soon become immensely famous in the next few years for directing " the godfather . " the actors are good ones , needless to say , as they all would have futures ahead of them in film . shirley knight is the least known of the three , although she is also underrated as an actor . james caan is especially effective here and he seems to just inhabit this character . this film remains little more than a curiosity now , no doubt because it is an early movie of coppola ' s , and i confess i had never heard of it . so god bless turner classic movies for bringing it to a new audience .  i loved the first 15 minutes , and i loved some of the dialogue in the tribunal--which proved to be the best showcase for the director ' s ahead-of-its-time method acting technique--but this movie ultimately disappoints . even when viewed purely as a metaphor of the oppressor / oppressed dynamics that were and are prevalent in the relationship between the us government and its more " disobedient " citizens , it still lacks punch and believability , and ultimately left me looking at my watch hoping the obvious ending would happen already . 

and for the record : despite rampant rumors to the contrary , this movie has never been banned in the us ( i can ' t comment on the rumors of uk censorship , but i ' m suspicious ) . hollywood refused to distribute it after its initial film festival showing , and i am more than willing to believe the nixon government had some influence on this decision ; however , the fact that it never appeared on american television is merely a reflection of this medium ' s rather careful and advertising-driven fashion of doing business . as for the present , you can have your very own copy of the dvd delivered to your door via amazon in a few days .  othello is set to burn the eyes of the viewers of this film . the bad depiction of shakespeare ' s characters , and the terrible rendition of the love that desi & john had , made this movie the horrendous filth that it is . by far , othello , directed by jeffery saks , is beyond mediocre and atrocious . 

the movie othello is a pitiful drama about the love between john and desi . their faithfulness to one another will be tested by the man ' s friend . in the opening scene of the film , it is clearly shown that the love between john and desdemona is inseparable beyond belief . moments later , ben jago , john ' s friend pops out into the screen scaring the viewers and showing them right away how much of a liar and power hungry person he is . 

by far , this movie was much more horrid than the shakespeare novel itself . with that being said , it does have a miniscule amount of good parts . for example , the love that was shown between john and desi , was depicted very well and it looked that the couple was so inseparable ; just as it was explained in the book . although the love between them was shown exceptionally well , it still did not show the jealously that othello had between cass and desi as well as it should . 

love , jealously , deceitfulness , this movie is based on all three of the main topics that were in the shakespeare novel . the novel however , really explains how all of this came together much better than the movie could . for example , the conclusion of this story ends much more differently in the book than in the film . much more detail is also put into the novel . this is why this film is such a disappointment , trust me , those who have read it will find it disappointing as well . 

in conclusion , this film was by far , the most horrendous depiction of a novel that has ever been put out by mankind . by avoiding to see this film , not only will viewers save themselves an hour two of their lives , but also save themselves an eye or two from the distasteful face of ben jago popping out at them .  a tough sell : british playwright ronald harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud , bellowing film about wwii shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled with an aged , blustery , brilliant-but-unreliable star at the end of his tether . the actor ' s effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of " king lear " ( during an air raid ! ) , yet both men are losing their grip on their unraveling situation . based on the waning years of actor donald wolfit , whose dresser was ronald harwood , this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome haven for scenery-chewing thespians . unfortunately , albert finney ( at this point in his career , not at all elderly ) seems too robust and quick-thinking to play the actor ; finney ( and oscar-nominated director peter yates ) cannot modulate sir ' s moods and bouts of coherency in a way that makes sense to us , so that in one scene he ' s stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice , and in the next he ' s curiously falling apart . with such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and aptitude , one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss ( and his future ) , yet servant tom courtenay prods and badgers and goads finney to carry on rather than rest . courtenay , who played this part on stage ( and was nominated for an oscar alongside finney for best actor ) , is far more attuned to his role , and eventually his bleating commands and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film . these two , thankfully , do not peck at each other ' s heads , and scenarist harwood is careful not to fall into a love-hate pattern ( which could possibly be perceived in the film ' s first act ) ; but , without a juxtaposition of servant vs . celebrity , there ' s nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the deterioration of narcissism , the hint at what once was . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  macbeth , i ' ve always thought , is the most accessible of shakespeare ' s ' great period ' plays . compact , focused , with heaps of violence , it should have been the play most open to screen adaptations . i ' m not aware of a really good rendering of the story , however - the best effort being orson welles ' s vigorous shoestring version . to the list of macbotches we must add the connery / baxendale effort . 

 ( it seems it was not a ' film adaptation ' at all , but a tv version that was given a theatrical release , post luhrman ' s romeo + juliet and branagh ' s hamlet . that might explain some of its flaws , but doesn ' t excuse them . ) 

it starts well , with a feisty battle sequence with pleasingly grisly witches looking on . poor old gray malkin and paddock are cut from the opening scene , but they aren ' t alone for long . in quick order they are joined by the bloodied sargent and his account of the battle , the treachery of the thane of cawdor , the luckless master o ' the tiger , even macbeth ' s meeting with duncan when he is invested as thane of cawdor . all of these had virtues that plead like angels trumpet tongued against the dark damnation of their sending off , but sent off they are . these aren ' t the only cuts , either . this is macbeth in a hurry . 

from the opening battle we are pitched directly into macbeth ' s encounter with the witches , which is well done . brian blessed , curiously , directed the witchy sequences , and he has great fun with the special effects as macbeth and banquo are told of their fates . jason connery as macbeth is awkward , obviously unsure what to make of the verse . graham mactavish as banquo , on the other hand , is capable , making his lines natural and easy . within a few minutes of connery ' s mumbling , the viewer is struck the urge to see the roles reversed and mactavish in the title role . no wonder macbeth felt he needed to kill him . 

these first few minutes marks the high point of the film . from there we move to helen baxendale receiving word of her husband . she ' s as lost as connery , and denied the beard that he gets to hide behind . her " unsex me here " invocation of evil is embarrassing , not unsettling . there are some reasonably clever touches - macbeth ' s " we will speak further " is not a sign of his hesitancy in the face of his wife ' s wicked ambition , but his attempt to silence her prattling as he throws her onto the bed . 

the acting of the leads is the biggest let down . connery ' s method consists of staring glazedly about the screen while he mumbles his monologues via voice-over . baxendale looks pinched and neurotic . an attempt to do something interesting with " is this a dagger " - the fantastical dagger is a shadow cast by a cross on an altar - falls flat due to connery ' s poor delivery and sloppy direction , which mars the production throughout . we accompany lady macbeth back into the murder chamber , where she gets to stab the reviving duncan , but the effect is comic , not dramatic . 

big scenes are botched - the appearance of banquo at the feast is made incomprehensible through attempts to mix subjective rendering of macbeth ' s delusion with what those around him see , or don ' t see . the second meeting with the witches is even less coherent , and the prophetic visions are confusing . timing seems to be an issue here - banquo ' s banquet is the centrepoint of the play , but the film moves rapidly towards conclusion after it , giving it an unbalanced feel and no scope for the intricacies of the riddles macbeth is caught in to be appreciated , or for his descent into madness to be convincing . another crucial cut is the scene where malcolm tests macduff , and macduff learns of the murder of his family . this robs his revenge of most of its emotional force - and the character of a lot of the screen time . he ' s a virtual stranger when he turns up to kill macbeth . 

a point for trying . mactavish ' s banquo earns another . the first few minutes garners another . but that ' s all . from then on it ' s sound and fury blah blah blah .  i saw this movie one time at a kiddie matinÃ©e at the north park theater in san diego in 1959 when it was released and i was 11 . it was one of three features that were shown that day . 

i have not seen it since but have wanted to because i am a film buff and appreciate the terrible along with the great , good and average films . 

what i remember most vividly is that the more sophisticated audience members , consisting of children between 8 and 15 , howled with laughter at the tree monster . 

a triple bill at a theater showing 3 adventure films is something an 11 year old does not forget , but i can ' t remember the names of the other 2 films . ( one did star george montgomery and david farrar . ) 

update : the other 2 films in this triple bill were much better . they were " watusi , " 1959 , with george montgomery and david farrar starring and " the angry red planet , " 1959 , with gerald mohr and naura hayden staring . ms . hayden has written a couple of books on health and fitness also .  rarely seen a movie that deviates so much from the original premise and still remains ( more or less ) acceptableÂbloodline is a rather short ( which is a good thing in this case ) escapade that focuses on the mysterious hellraiser box . who wanted it to be made and how it cast a spell on the entire bloodline of the man who eventually created it . we ' re introduced to 3 generations of the merchant family ( all played by bruce ramsey ) ; one in 18th century paris , one in the present day and the last one in a future galaxy far , far away opinions on this storyline may differ a lotÂeither you think it ' s very idiotic and far-fetched orÂoriginal and dared . the initial atmosphere and setting by clive barker has completely vanished , yet the morbid surrounding remains and several sequences are still very creepy and unsettling . hellraiser : bloodline contains quite a lot of exquisite slaughtering and the charismatic presence of pinhead ( doug bradley ) still is an extra horror-value . pinhead Â accompanied by a pet puppy this time Â still knows how to killÂtoo bad he talks too much and his vicious speeches tend to get boring quickly . best aspects in this production are the newly introduced `cenobites ' and the occult parisian portrait . giant turn-offs are the weak script , the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to barker ' s initial masterpiece . 

although not highly memorable itself , bloodline stands as the last watchable hellraiser film . after this sequel , the series went downhill completely . so far , 2 more sequels came out ( 2 more are still in process ) and neither of those is worth seeing . hellraiser : bloodline suffered from a lot of production difficulties and the director eventually preferred to be credited as alan smitheeÂmeaning he doesn ' t want to be remembered as the director of it . who could blame him ?  i give the show a six because of the fact that the show was in fact a platform for damon wayans as the cosby show was for bill cosby , it dealt with a lot of issues with humor and i felt that it in fact tailored to getting a laugh as opposed to letting the jokes come from the character . 

michael kyle an interesting patriarch and a wisecracking person . he is phenomenal in movies , but in the show he was there for the wisecrack and though i loved it , i felt that the laugh was more important than plausibility . 

jay kyle i have loved her since house party and have enjoyed her in school daze and martin , this was a great role for her and she made a great choice in picking this sitcom to co-star in . i also feel that jay and michael were more like equals in the show but jay was more the woman who fed her crazy husbands the lines and went along with his way of unorthodox discipline because she may have felt that it worked

jr just plain stupid , his character should have been well developed and even though he does have his moments of greatness , we are returned to the stupidity as if he learned nothing , which drives me nuts ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! not to mention that most of the situations ( in episodes i ' ve seen ) seems to center around him

clair the attractive sister who dated a christian , i found her boyfriend ' s character to be more interesting than she was ( she ' d be better off sticking to movies , the writers should have done more to show her intelligence but it ' s not stereotypical enough ) 

kady lovable and the youngest daughter . i think the writers established her character most on the show aside from the parents and franklin

franklin i love this character and i think they derived it from smart guy ( t . j . mowry ) which only lasted one season . they did a great job of casting for this little genius ( the effort would have been made if jr would have been the smart one but show the down sides also ) 

all in all , this sitcom is a wonderful thing and it ' s homage to the cosby show is well done , i love the show and wished it would have stayed on longer than that . i can ' t wait to see the series finale i don ' t understand the exaggerated good critics about this film , except that a lot of people from venezuela are understandably very excited , based on that the venezuelan cinema is really a bit behind of what other countries are in the region . 

the movie first of all is too repetitive , a lot of scenes are almost identical from each of the both leading roles , so you get the impression that it ' s a time filler . a time filler is also a good point , as this movie is definitely too long with 105 minutes , you will start to get tired after a while and watch on the clock . 

all actors are quite bad , by exception of the venezuelan guy edgar ramirez , who brings in a bit of slapstick and plays the role of the venezuelan recruit " pedro " . 

by the way , this is not a representative movie about the people of the region ( caribean zone ) , it tends to ridicules them .  as everyone knows , nobody can play scarlett o ' hara like vivien leigh , and nobody can play rhett butler like clark gable . all others pale in comparison , and timothy dalton and joanne whalley are no exceptions . one thing that i really couldn ' t get past was that joanne has brown eyes . the green eyes were the most enhancing feature of scarlett ' s good looks , and in this sequel she has been stripped of those . 

the movie , as well as the book , had several lulls in it . the new characters weren ' t all that memorable , and i found myself forgetting who was who . i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever . it could be that i ' m only 11 , but i saw no change in her attitude until the last say , 10 minutes when rhett told her she had grown up . if rhett hadn ' t told her that , i would have never guessed that there was any change in her attitude . she really loved cat , her baby . she likes this child best because she had it with rhett , her only loved husband . still , if you ' ve read gone with the wind , you would see that children make no difference in scarlett ' s world . 

quite frankly , it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without rhett . all anybody cares about is whether or not rhett and scarlett get back together , and scarlett took way too long to get to that . it is virtually nothing compared to gone with the wind , but then again what isn ' t ? if you have read the novel , you will like that better than the movie . 

i would watch it , just because it is the sequel to gone with the wind , regardless of whether or not it ' s worthwhile . it may not satisfy you entirely , but it will get you some of the way there .   " curse of michael myers " is a very frustrating piece to deal with for a fan of the halloween series . after a very disappointing letdown in halloween 5 , the series reached a near ebb in plot lines , with a silly devolution into witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to the worship of michael myers . " curse of michael myers " ups the ante in blood and gore , but really represents a decay in the series ' integrity . it ' s too bad to , as this is the last movie for donald pleasance as the character of dr . loomis . pleasance has some good screen moments ( precious ones if your a fan of the series ) as the now very aged and as he says " very retired doctor " . sadly he died before the movie was completed , and it is very apparent at the conclusion of the film that the stories original climatic scene was never realized . right from the beginning credits , halloween 6 has more of the feel of a made-for-tv movie then that of the block-buster horror flick that it started out as in 1978 . any loyal halloween alumni should have demanded more from this film , . . . dr . loomis and donald pleasance deserved more .  i didn ' t really hate mirrormask . i just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals . the movie begins with a young girl named helana who works in a circus . but while other children ( supposedly ) want to run away to the circus she only wants to run away from the circus . during a heated argument with her mother , helana wishes she would drop dead . bad move . the mother gets ill with . . . something ( presumably cancer ) and needs surgery . on the night before surgery she dreams she travels to a wonderful world composed of her her dreams and nightmares where she " finds herself " . personally the movie got crap for me as soon as she started dreaming . the early scenes show the weird and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the bleakness of the hospital and the filth of an apartment block . but a soon as she dreams the whole films shifts to cgi land where nearly everything is a computer image . the problem is that this dream world has none of the mystery and wonder it should have . while films like the wizard of oz seemed enticing to explore mirrormask shoves images in our faces and then snatches them away to give us another image . there ' s little rhyme or reason to the design in this film and even though some things are very pretty ( the librarian is a masterpiece ) they just disappear so quickly that they ' re soon forgotten . helana and her sidekick valentine are annoying at best and unbearable at worst . overall mirrormask is like a pretty stake that you bite and find out is actually ash . stick to the real world kids .  dead man ' s bounty ( the film ' s american title ) has the look and feel of a classic italian western . the cinematography , costumes , and sets look great . the cast is rugged , not a pretty face among them . at the beginning i was preparing for a pretty cool movie but what i eventually witnessed was an absolute disaster . 

the script was perfectly dreadful . there was no suspense whatsoever and very little action or worthwhile drama . 

despite looking great , the cast spoke ( english ) with heavy european accents that were often unintelligible . 

the final nail in it ' s coffin was the broad streak of pretentiousness that paints most of the picture , focusing heavily on the character of the barmaid who ' s featured in a couple of very awkward sex scenes . also her speech near the end was pretty repugnant ! 

the only novelty comes from the stunt casting of val kilmer in the role of the dead man , continuing his recent string of doa performances !  an insane assault on viewers senses . this is a mish-mash of assorted hindi and english movies - poorly done . the name carries over from a 70s ' multi star cast , which the 2002 version also boasts of . the story is taken from the 70s ' sunil dutt / reena roy starrer - " nagin " and visual effects taken ( a horrible attempt ) from the matrix , terminator 2 and mission impossible ii . 

set in a college environment ( sunil shetty , akshaye kumar , manisha - college kids ! ! ! ? ? ? ! ! ) , manisha koirala is the victim , who mistakes a fatal assault on her by two students as a collective effort on the part of our heros . as it turns out manisha is a cobra ( nag ) snake reborn as a girl in this life and her mate from the previous life , now a super powerful-all-and-any-shape-assuming ( ichadhari nag ) - munish kohli , is out looking for her in this life . manisha appeals to him to avenge her violation and murder . 

so begins the mad killing spree , where the avenging lover starts singling each male of the group , with increasing powers and tricks with successive attempts . the effects are extremely cheap , with computer generated skeletons , morphing bodies and motorcycle stunts completing the farce . 

carry over from nagin includes raj babbar playing a catholic priest who provides temporary relief to our boys with a more " religiously correct " multi-religion locket ( the original nagin only had an " om " ) . sunny deol plays manisha ' s love interest in her current life and the ultimate saviour against the all powerful munish kohli . 

music and songs are below average . 

avoid if you don ' t fancy cheap thrills .  it is a story as old as man . the jealousy for another man ' s wife and possessions . there are even commandments against it . 

in this story , raymond burr ( " perry mason " , " ironside " ) is the manager of a runner plantation who lusts after the owners wife and feels that he isn ' t treated with respect . the wife , the starlet barbara payton , who was trying to make a comeback after a string of sordid affairs , was lusting after burr , who killed her husband , paul cavanagh . 

but , lurking about was a strange woman , the housekeeper ( gisela werbisek ) who sees everything , and who was capable of some voodoo to avenge the wronged , which also included another young woman ( carol varga ) to whom burr also professed love . 

burr is poisoned and becomes , or thinks he becomes , a gorilla . payton will have to mate with kong if she ever wants her marriage consummated , as he goes into the jungle every night . 

the end is predictable . but , the stirring question of this film is why payton would ever be afraid . with those sharply pointed missiles jutting out from her chest , no animal could get near her to do harm .  beautiful images , propaganda and history as toy . the ingredients of this film , good , interesting but with many shadows . politicall shadows . jefferson is more than the hero of a mythical america . he is silhouette of a vision about life and society , an extraordinary thinker , teacher of large part of north america . in film is only superman . the delicate contour of ideas are crushed . the subtle birth of essential truth is forgotten . and jefferson is basic instrument for create a good image of american realities . the end , triumphal and fake , romance and heroic , is gun suicide of a story who may be tall with more wisdom . and the war against " avatar " is another gray stain . for one who heard nothing about jefferson , movie is a good beginning . for the others - disillusion . it is like the precious silk of a tailor . but the tailor is fascinating about silk and the clothes are only ordinary cloth . so , a sad experience . slices of beauty and boring lakes , patriotic lesson and the crush of expectation . a film who must impressive . and the ash of a story who could be magnificent .  there are so very few films where just the title tells you all you need to know about the film . such a film is i was a communist for the fbi . another example would be i married a monster from outer space . 

the really interesting thing about this film is how in heaven ' s name did this get nominated for an oscar in the documentary category ? it is not a documentary in any sense of the word , it ' s not even in that hybrid category of docudrama . it ' s just a rather exploitive film about the work of an fbi undercover agent named matt cvetic who infiltrated the communist party in pittsburgh and got active in trying to take over the steelworker ' s union for the communists and reporting on said activities to his handlers in the fbi . 

a documentary of that work might have been interesting , but what we got was a film to fit those paranoid times . i found it fascinating that when cvetic finally broke his cover it was to the house un-american activities committee rather than the trial in new york of the communist party leaders . there was a moment in the film where head communist james millican tells his followers to start spreading the word that the house un american activities committee was composed of a bunch of right wing yahoos looking to get their names in front of the camera . now what could have given him that idea ? anyway just connect the dots and no doubt the word their came from j . edgar hoover trying to give some credence to huac by having an effective undercover come out there rather than at an actual trial . little thing there called cross examination . 

warner brothers who produced i was a communist for the fbi later produced big jim mclain which starred john wayne about a huac investigator in hawaii . huac did grab on to credit for the work done by the honolulu pd in breaking up a communist spy ring there among the dockworkers . but at least in john wayne ' s film nobody claimed it was a documentary . 

frank lovejoy is in the title role as cvetic and his fbi handlers are richard webb and philip carey . dorothy hart plays a pittsburgh school teacher who says that there are 30 or so like here in that school system indoctrinating the young among whom is ron hagerthy , lovejoy ' s son . she has a change of heart about the communists and lovejoy has to save her from a homicidal fate planned by his superiors . ironically hart left the movies and went to work for all places , the united nations which as we know has been accused often of being a communist nest in the usa . 

over half a century later and we really have very few objective works on film or in print about the communist party of the usa . they were in fact a very active bunch in the labor movement . the real heroes in stopping them were labor organizers like walter reuther in the uaw or david dubinsky in the ilgwu . but since they were people of the left they just don ' t have the following on the right to be suitable propaganda material . 

anyway i was a communist for the fbi is an exploitive work based on a real life character and a testament to those paranoid times .  this is a bad film , as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts . as a result , it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film miss dunne or mr . huston should have been proud of making . however , the film is worth watching if you are a fan of " pre-code " films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls do put out--even if they aren ' t married and even if their partner is ! ! 

the film begins with miss dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to europe for wwi . in the process , she meets a scalawag ( bruce cabot ) who eventually convinces her to sleep with him . she becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman . however , miss dunne does not want him back , as she realizes he ' s not worth it , but later her baby dies at child birth . while all these very controversial plot elements are used , they are always alluded to--almost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way , kids in the audience will be clueless ( after all , films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time ) . 

surprisingly , this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and cabot ends about 1 / 4 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to . it was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned it--tacking it on to still another film . in this second phase of the film , miss dunne unexpectedly begins working at a women ' s prison ( though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there ) . what we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate . and , as a result of all this violence , miss dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer . 

but then , out of the blue , another type of film emerges and the women ' s prison reform business goes by the wayside . dunne meets a judge ( walter huston ) who is married but he desperately wants her . now throughout the film , dunne is portrayed as a very good girl--even though she did have unmarried sex with cabot ( she was more or less tricked into it ) . but now , single irene , who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man . he tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only , but she never thinks to investigate if this is true , and with his assurance , off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business ! but , while she ' s pregnant with his love child , he ' s indicted for being a crooked judge . he assures her he ' s innocent , but he ' s convicted and it sure sounds like he ' s a scoundrel--using inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune . then , in the final moments of the film , miss dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until huston is released . the film then ends . 

so , we basically have three separate films and a bizarre early 30s idea of what a nice girl should be like . i gathered that she should be a strong-minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships ! this really undoes all the positives about dunne ' s character and it ' s really hard to imagine anyone liking the film . a strong women ' s rights advocate might easily be offended at how weak-minded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect ! with a decent re-write , this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film , but it couldn ' t make up its mind what it wanted to be and was just another dull pre-code film .  considering the filmâs reputation as truly the worst of the worst , i was looking forward to watching woodâs crappus opus ( my word ) ; itâs not necessarily any more inept than the other woods iâve watched â however , being from the reefer madness ( 1938 ) school of film-making , glen or glenda doesnât come across as readily âenjoyableâ as his genre efforts . 

also , this surely emerges as horror legend bela lugosiâs nadir ( his first of three âcollaborationsâ with the director ) : one wonders whether he was really aware what kind of film it was ( considering the actorâs history of heavy medication and the sheer senselessness of his cameo ) . besides , lugosiâs idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps at its most awkward hereâ¦though woodâs script is mostly to blame for this â given the impossible dialogue ( with repeated nonsensical allusions to âpuppy-dog tailsâ and âbig fat snailsâ ) he handed the ailing star ! by the way , wood himself plays the central role ( under the pseudonym daniel davis ) â and , being just as worthless in this area , proves to have been an all-round dog ! ; dolores fuller â his wife and co-star â was similarly untalented ( she would also appear in jail bait [1954] ) â¦but , at the very least , the image where the latter finally lets glen wear her angora sweater did give tim burtonâs affectionate biopic ed wood ( 1994 ) its famous poster ! 

incidentally , the latter film features a presumably fictionalized meeting between wood and orson welles â well , for all intents and purposes , glen or glenda constitutes ed woodâs citizen kane ( 1941 ) given its gleeful propensity for gimmicky narrative techniques : in fact , the barest thread of plot is padded with stock footage galore ( many of it irrelevant , such as the bewildering instances of s & m ) and inane dream sequences ( highlighted by the presence of an impish demon sporting outrageous bushy eyebrows that would make martin scorsese weep with envy ) ! the filmâs sincere attempt at a plea for tolerance and psychological probing into the affliction / phenomenon of transvestism is , however , sabotaged at every turn by the sheer amateurishness of the approach . 

for what itâs worth , the edition i watched was the âextended re-issue versionâ which included six minutes of âdepravedâ footage ( directed by w . merle connell ) censored on original release ! furthermore , my copy went out-of-synch every so often ( which forced me to rewind it slightly to get the audio back on track ) â though , thankfully , this was the fault of the source conversion to divx as opposed to the film itself .  director john madden , of shakespeare in love fame , gives us another pretty bad film in ethan frome . the plot centers around a new reverend coming into the town of starkfield where he learns the story of the local crippled man ethan frome ' s sick wife and one-time romantic tryst with the maid . adapted by richard nelson from pulitzer prize-winning author edith wharton ' s novel , this film isn ' t interesting in the least thanks to an abysmally weak script and poor direction that turns scenes that are supposed to be poignant into laughable schmaltz . still , there are other aspects apart of the film that work - the cinematography is well done , rachel portman contributes a lovely score , and while no one is at their best , liam neeson , joan allen , patricia arquette , and tate donovan work well in their roles . but overall , ethan frome is only marginally worthwhile and is easily forgotten .  feeling minnesota , directed by steven baigelmann , and starring keanu reeves , cameron diaz and vincent d ' onofrio : the strained relationship between two brothers , sam ( d ' onofrio ) and jjaks ( reeves ) , is pushed to breaking point when jjaks arrives at sam ' s wedding and makes off with the bride , freddie ( diaz ) , a former stripper , marrying sam to repay a gambling debt owed to night-club owner red ( lindo ) . baigelman ' s writing and directing debut is a frustrating mess , full of hateful characters and lacking coherence . putting keanu and diaz in the same movie should at least provide some eye candy , but baigelman even cops out on that score , grudging his actors up with little positive effect . very poor .  as everyone knows , nobody can play scarlett o ' hara like vivien leigh , and nobody can play rhett butler like clark gable . all others pale in comparison , and timothy dalton and joanne whalley are no exceptions . one thing that i really couldn ' t get past was that joanne has brown eyes . the green eyes were the most enhancing feature of scarlett ' s good looks , and in this sequel she has been stripped of those . 

the movie , as well as the book , had several lulls in it . the new characters weren ' t all that memorable , and i found myself forgetting who was who . i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever . it could be that i ' m only 11 , but i saw no change in her attitude until the last say , 10 minutes when rhett told her she had grown up . if rhett hadn ' t told her that , i would have never guessed that there was any change in her attitude . she really loved cat , her baby . she likes this child best because she had it with rhett , her only loved husband . still , if you ' ve read gone with the wind , you would see that children make no difference in scarlett ' s world . 

quite frankly , it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without rhett . all anybody cares about is whether or not rhett and scarlett get back together , and scarlett took way too long to get to that . it is virtually nothing compared to gone with the wind , but then again what isn ' t ? if you have read the novel , you will like that better than the movie . 

i would watch it , just because it is the sequel to gone with the wind , regardless of whether or not it ' s worthwhile . it may not satisfy you entirely , but it will get you some of the way there .  i had known brad linaweaver at florida state u in the early 70 ' s when he was an inspiring , inventive writer who i thought was headed for greater glory . 

and that is why i rented this video . well , well , well , the time has not been kind to mr linaweaver . i suppose the pressures of making a living makes higher aspirations expendable . another flower whose bloom has come and gone un-noticed in the summer breeze . amen . there is nothing more to say . and nothing more to add . a sad epitaph to a once blossoming career as stated above . but it is the price one pays for chasing shadows without a firm foundation or goals for oneself in life . because this movie has no goal , no purpose , and i kept telling myself , what happened to brad ' s creativity , his once shining genius ? gone , gone , years of neglect has deteriorated his once shining mind .  the 3rd and last big screen spin off from the very popular itv sitcom of the early 1970 ' s , holiday on the buses is every bit as resistible and crude as the previous two efforts , and observing from a standpoint three and a half decades later , it is truly mind boggling that even one film was produced in this franchise . 

what constitutes the plot surrounds the adventures of stan butler ( reg varney ) , his conductor jack ( bob grant ) and their bumblingly autocratic inspector blake ( stephen lewis ) after their sackings from their regular jobs at the bus depot . they all find work in similar positions at a holiday camp with stan ' s family ( doris hare , anna karen , michael robbins ) following therewith . 

british cinema had a deserved and considerable reputation for high quality in the 1960 ' s , but much of this was due to american financial support and guidance which sadly drew to a close as the 1970 ' s dawned . thereafter , notable homegrown titles ( get carter being the among these very few exceptions ) became as rare as mick jagger in a stable marriage , and uk cinema went down the road of cheap budgets , sleazy and witless sex comedies ( the confessions series , come play with me ) and flabby , elongated celluloid versions of various tv shows , mostly sitcoms ( this being one of many hideous examples ) . only dad ' s army and porridge came off fairly respectably in this regard ; the quirky success of the first on the buses film ( it was the biggest box-office hit of it ' s year in 1971 , nonsensical to think now ! ) led to two further sequels . 

to be fair , the tv series itself had a cheerful , ripe , non-pc vulgarity about it which was reasonably tolerable in half-hour sitcom form , but stretched to three times that length it taxes the patience beyond belief . it ' s ironical that hammer films produced this effort as it virtually resembles a horror film in the literal sense , with ancient puns , hackneyed , poorly-timed slapstick and awful , seedy production values . 

a chance to send up the cheesiness of the british holiday camp is totally wasted here in favour of the above elements , and it is most bizarre , if not gruesome , to see the obviously 50-something varney and the beaky-nosed , long-toothed grant managing to instantly charm young women barely in their early twenties , while constantly laughing at their own bravado and lame jokes . the presence of wilfrid brambell ( from steptoe and son ) romancing the aged miss hare does not help matters either , and even though the film lasts about 1 and a half hours , it drags on to an interminably depressing degree . 

thankfully , this was the last film in this most dire of film trilogies , and the tv series itself came to an end around the same time , with a sequel ( don ' t drink the water , which was roundly savaged by the critics and ignored by audiences ) following in 1975 . most of the leading actors involved were not seen much afterwards , but the worst affected was bob grant . afflicted with depression and other mental problems for many years , he committed suicide in 2003 . a sad coda to a sitcom that was the most popular of it ' s era ( it has not aged too well either ) , and should have remained that way , rather than the three financially successful but artistically hopeless big screen hybrids which diluted the happy memories and occasional merits of it ' s tv counterpart . 

rating : 2 and a half out of 10 .  thunder alley finds fabian banned from nascar tracks after causing the death of another driver . stanley adams might want to put him on his team of racers , but the other drivers aren ' t for having him around . 

desperate for employment fabian hooks up with an auto stunt show owner jan murray who ' s paying him peanuts and trying to capitalize on fabian ' s bad rep . he ' s got to take it , but annette funicello who ' s murray ' s daughter provides another reason to stick around . 

the rest of the film is fabian ' s struggle to get back to the nascar circuit while at the same time juggling both annette and his current girl friend diane mcbain . personally , i would have taken mcbain , she has it all over annette . 

thunder alley is helped by location shooting at the southern nascar tracks and good film footage of nascar racing . not helped by a rather silly story which delves into the real reason for fabian ' s problems and his rather unrealistic recovery from same . 

still fans of nascar might go for this .  you have to hand it to writer-director john hughes . with enormous success behind him in the misfit-teenager / high school vein , he managed to branch out into other areas of comedy , finding in the bargain a great ally in comedian-actor john candy . here , goof-off adult candy becomes a better person after agreeing to babysit his brother ' s wiseacre kids ; it ' s a surefire formula designed to please both cynical teens as well as their parents , and it isn ' t any wonder the film was a winner with theater audiences . still , hughes relies almost completely on candy ' s charm to put the scenario over , and one may eventually grow tired of the repetitious gags with the star front and center . the kids are sitcom-smart , the other adults shapeless blobs , and amy madigan is too intense , too hyped-up playing uncle buck ' s girlfriend . later became a tv series , which is befitting since the material was already television-perfected . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  watching this film today i got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning of the story . john wayne rides up on this trading post / saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies . all he sees is the signs of a massacre , some dead bodies , signs of a fight and no one alive in sight . that ' s because the owner ' s daughter is hidden in a secret room , the kind you find in old english murder mysteries . 

the reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly priestholes . catholic families clinging to the old faith in 16th century england built these things to hide those on the run from royal authorities because of their faith . not something you see in westerns , but a good gimmick . 

unfortunately because of bad editing or writing or both we never know exactly what brought wayne to this place exactly . but this was a b western and not even a good one at that . 

gabby hayes is in this and he ' s clean shaven and playing a mute part of the time . an unusual circumstance for the garrulous gabby . 

if you want to bother and find out what happens and see a whiskerless gabby hayes then see this film .  george and mildred was a spin off from the mid 1970s sit-com man about the house . though i haven ' t seen the series since it was last broadcast i do remember it being fairly amusing with most of the comedy arising from the eponymous couple going to live beside the snobbish fourmile family , a sort of love thy neighbour without the cynical racist gags . 

having seen this " big screen version of the show " i find myself asking what it ' s a big screen version of ? certainly not of a popular mid 70s sit com of the same name . for some reason the movie jettisons all character interaction from the television by having george and mildred leaving the street where they live behind and getting caught up in a plot involving some serious gangsters who want something george has inadvertently picked up and which leads to some cringe making situations and lines like : 

 " did he give it to you " 

 " no that ' s the first time a man has resisted my charms " 

 " i meant the envelope " 

you do get the impression that screenwriter dick sharples ( who never wrote an episode for the original sit-com ) has never seen an episode of the source material and has got the show confused with the carry on series of films . in many ways it resembles the same mistakes of the latter lost in space movie in that it has absolutely nothing in common with the series that spawned it there really is very little positive that can be said about this film . walter pidgeon is a truly unconvincing hero and even moreso when he tries to go " undercover " as a villain who , we ' re meant to believe , drinks too much and knocks his wife about a bit . margaret leighton , as the wife / undercover sergeant is a little more convincing but it ' s still difficult to believe that any hood worth their salt would not have seen through their charade in less than a minute . the plot , about a bullion heist , is silly , and the action drags rather than grips . david tomlinson , who plays algy in the same way that david tomlinson seems to play all his roles , is the only glimmer of light in a wholly dull affair .  i was told jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences . i guessed the film will be interesting . in fact isn ' t at all . not so much profound for a such subject . " eternity " never-ending life . experiences after death and " dejavu " . the film is not as a comedy but isn ' t funny at all , at least not express yet . it ' s so naive . charming film but naive film . a must to avoid . the middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and it ' s not the matter at all . eileen davidson is so charming and voight is doing his best . normal is a co producer and screenwriter of this movie . the film was launched straight on video so i discovered it on a video store . it ' s a pity ' cause i well know voight was seriously involved with spirituality and the film isn ' t so much profound about it .  roeg ' s take on conrad ' s " heart of darkness " was not quite what i had expected . although based on one of history ' s most studied and interesting texts , the film just became sort of dull . the story just never manages to grasp the viewer . it just comes across as indifferent in a way . 

the traces of the text are easily spotted , but still this is not really conrad ' s " heart of darkness " . benedict fitzgerald ' s ( who also wrote " the passion of the christ " ) script just uses conrad as an inspiration , and thus becomes fitzgerald ' s " heart of darkness " . the film is just not worth it , unless you are particularly interested in conrad or perhaps john malkovich .  this show is awesome and we have been enjoying it thoroughly . set in alaska , i don ' t agree with the homosexual content on tonight ' s show . i feel that you are pushing too hard to bring new york to alaska . its one thing to have a new yorker struggling in the alaska wild , but to try to turn the alaska town into new york ? this is a nice show about dainty women and true alaska men and to bring a same sex couple into the mix is throwing the balance way off . alaska should be portrayed as a man and new york as the woman . i think the first 9 shows have the perfect balance with what you all are doing . can ' t we have a nice show without the imbalance of nature .   * mild spoilers * 

in this would-be satire , chaplin set his sights on the evils of german fascism , playing the twin roles of tomanian dictator adenoid hynkel and one of his subjects , an inadvertent world war i hero and jewish barber . through events inspired by both adolf hitler and the marx brothers , hynkel negotiates contracts and declares war on neighbouring osterlich whilst finding time for numerous , oddly flat set-pieces . the dictator ' s much-celebrated waltz with an inflatable globe is actually entirely heavyhanded , underwhelming and unfunny . 

chaplin should certainly be commended for looking to lampoon hitler and for speaking out strongly on celluloid - his much-maligned final speech is actually the bold , memorable highlight of the piece - but the film simply isn ' t sharp or funny enough to merit the praise frequently heaped upon it , nor to demand repeated viewings . the best gags are away from hynkel ' s tiresome posturing and involve the barber attempting to avoid a large spinning bomb ( a sequence which steals from the gun tussle in the gold rush ) and later , with a pot on his head , accidentally walking the plank off the roof of his shop . 

compared to the director ' s silent classics , the great dictator is slow , wildly inconsistent and altogether somewhat unsatisfactory , whilst the barren spells between laughs are often long and difficult to endure . there is no doubt that chaplin was a genius , but even geniuses make disappointing pictures and the great dictator certainly ranks as such .  as an avid gone with the wind fan , i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters . luckily , the film on its own was a wonderful piece . when the book scarlett came out , i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together . while the book lacks any true quality , it remains a good story , and , as long as i was able to separate it from the original , was and still is enjoyable . however , i consider the six hours i spent watching the " scarlett " miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life . discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in margaret mitchell ' s book , this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape , mistrust , murder , and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from . the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film , and even carried through in the second book , and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character . in the novel , scarlett o ' hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family . after coming to an " arrangement " with rhett , she agrees to leave , and proceeds to reconnect with her o ' hara relatives in savannah . eventually , she accompanies her cousin colum , a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood , to ireland , to further explore her family ' s " roots that go deep , " and is eventually named " the o ' hara , " the head of the family . while her duties as the o ' hara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara , scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners , and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties . she , having been scorned by rhett time and time again , eventually agrees to marry luke , the earl of fenton , until rhett comes along in a clichÃ©d " night-on-white-horse " - type of a rescue . the " scarlett " miniseries fails even to do this justice . raped by her fiancÃ© and scorned by her family , the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed . 

i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision .  after matt dillon ' s phenomenal performance in crash , most will probably rush to pick up a copy of factotum to see if dillon is for real or simply got a lucky rebound from a great script . 

well , factotum certainly has its moments , but the plainness of . . . everything will most likely turn viewers off . however nothing should be taken away from dillon . his performance is wonderful and full of excellent deadpan humor , proving he ' s a solid actor with significant chops ; it ' s just a shame about the directing and script . 

the story is about henry " hank " chinaski ( dillon ) and his refusal to conform to anything resembling normalcy . he quits or gets fired from jobs in mere minutes , only to find himself back in a dreary pub meeting even drearier women while trying to write a nonconformist novel . we never really know what the novel is about except that it involves " everything " ( cancer , movies , you , me ) . 

skipping from workplace to workplace and constantly returning to jan ( lili taylor , the haunting ) , a loser girlfriend who ' s just as dispiriting as himself , hank tries vainly to discover what his life is supposed to hold for him . whether he ever learns what that is is up for interpretation . some may say that he never does , while others might argue that his life is simply a path to obscurity . 

regardless , there ' s not much substance to factotum even with matt dillon ' s fine performance . the story meanders through hank ' s life without much thought given as to where to take the audience . and that ' s a shame . dillon ' s performance would ' ve shone even brighter if given a decent script .  during production , this lwt series was titled ' rocket to the moon ' , a title that everyone on set at the time thought was cheesy enough . then word came through that it had been retitled ' reach for the moon ' , as if this the addition of this new word would evoke heavy metaphorical meanings involving the relationships and aspirations of the characters . this same heavy handed lack of subtlety and understanding is clear throughout the very fabric of the entire series , and the same tired and boring love-triangle storyline is actually stretched out over 7 episodes ! any television program that decides to use the ' love-triangle ' storyline for even a single episode is pushing it , but to smear it over seven episodes is unforgivable . there are reasons to watch however , with the scenery of the isle of wight certainly providing a beautiful setting , and the seemingly effortless performance of lynda bellingham hitting all the right comedy marks . this , however is not enough . a number of performances are noticeable , especially when placed against the static and emotionless wasteland which jonathan kerrigan refers to as his face . i have already mentioned lynda bellingham in the role of ' fussy mother ' ( yes , thats as far as character development and back-story goes ) , but i was impressed by the actor maurice roeves ( who is by far the most experienced actor in the cast , having appeared in everything from classic movies such as richard attenborough ' s ' oh what a lovely war ' , and ' the eagle has landed ' , and tv including baywatch , holby city , the bill , eastenders , cheers , doctor who in the 80s , star trek , and even going to hollywood with sylvestor stallone in 1995s judge dredd ) whose performance reminded me very much of actual teachers i have met - often incapable men , whose lives are tinged with a very sad streak . it is refreshing to see that roeves is still getting work , having also appeared in the 1998 british film ' the acid house ' and even more recently alongside the wonderful maria bello and sean bean in ' the dark ' . the standout reason to watch this series , even though his appearances are very few . another actor who tries his hardest to elevate the program , is ben miles , in the role of the sex-mad ' typical man ' brother ( once again , what an original character ! ) . as with roeves , the cv says it all . after elevating this , miles has since appeared in the hollywood movie ' v for vendetta ' , and the 2001 star studded film ' the affair of the necklace ' , alongside brian cox , adrien brody , christopher walken and jonathan pryce . unfortunately the fairly capable actors i have mentioned are resigned to relatively small roles in comparison to the dramatic driftwood that is kerrigan and saira todd , both of whom seem to have been in casualty for too long , and haven ' t yet learned to act . even the tolerable frances grey is made to suffer in the presence of such theatrically fetal mannequins , and unfortunately for her , the lasting memory i have of her from the set , is of the ad asking for another take of a relatively complex shot because during the take , she subconsciously ' pulled her knickers out of her crack ! ' . familiar faces appear in each episode - child actors from cbbc programs , and dramas such as ' 2 point 4 children ' , and other regulars from commercials such as mr ben ' s ( " they ' ll remember me for this " ) , lynda ' the oxo lady ' bellingham , and others that i don ' t even want to remember . each episode halfheartedly tries to ' deal with issues ' such as teenage pregnancy , disruptive pupils , and rocket building ( ! ) . . . things that grange hill was doing better when my parents were young ! overall , this series was a disappointment , and a wasted opportunity to craft a genuinely interesting and well developed drama series . unfortunately , for them they took the easy route , both in the writing and ( for the most part ) in the casting . i would recommend both ' waterloo road ' and ' the street ' , to fans of good drama - the latter in particular which managed to achieve this . if you like the isle of wight , don ' t ' reach for the moon ' , reach for the holiday brochure instead - it probably contains more character development !  a feminist tract in which if you the viewer believe that : i ) wild animals are seldom tamed by singing but instead attack , kill and eat ( the line that grizzlies never attack unless provoked was a hoot - unless " provoked " means that it sees flesh ) ; ii ) homosexuality is both immoral per se -- and its acceptance almost always associated throughout history with signs of a society ' s dissolution and decay iii ) few women are bisexual ( in this one , virtually every woman is presented as having no preference for men or women ) iv ) divorce is far worse than infidelity v ) land is there for human beings to use , develop and enjoy vi ) it is as incumbent upon a mother of an adult son to keep in touch as it is upon the son vii ) a mother raising her son alone is an unfortunate and real tragedy for the child viii ) the idolization of a parent for worthwhile ideals is a good and healthy thing ix ) adults continue to bear a responsibility for their sexual behavior , no matter their age , and the duty to engage in this most intimate and giving of acts only within the most intimate and openly sacrificial of relationships : marriage -- believe me , you are not going to like this film ! essentially it ' s a howard stern sort of fellow who is brought down by a jane fonda sort of woman ( think the electric horseman ) . it ' s ugly stuff because the values , the ideals , of the screenplay are all so harmful . 

i share the other objections about the odd things in the writing : a ) why would this man lose every girlfriend he has -- because he refuses to reveal that his mother ' s death and funeral caused him to be unable to keep dates with them ? it ' s a mystery why he just keeps saying " it was personal " when faced with angry and disappointed women . huh ? 

b ) there ' s an enormous inconsistency ( i . e . , the screenwriter wants to have it both ways ) by telling us that the protagonist ' s mother loved the father with everything she had - and then later we ' re told that there was only one great love in her life - her lesbian girlfriend . 

c ) the underlying legal assumptions are nonsense . we ' re never told that the executor has any right to live at the property - merely that she shall determine the timing of the sole heir ' s title and right to occupy the property . yet somehow the film makes it appear that the executor is the rightful occupant - which is crazy . ( try to think of any executor of any will who uses the decedent ' s property before the will ' s bequests are fulfilled - it doesn ' t happen ) . 

d ) the assumption throughout this film is that women are equally drawn to men and women - it ' s just absurd . thus , we ' re told : i ) that penelope ann miller ' s character is dating other men near the end of the film - after having been with the decedent for five years - and before that in a fulfilling relationship with the protagonist , ii ) that the protagonist ' s housekeeper after being devoted throughout her adult life to her kind husband - is now dating another woman iii ) that one girlfriend upset with the protagonist would now therefore " like to try a woman " . 

iv ) that a male transsexual is eager to date the protagonist v ) that mary kay place ' s character naturally looked at other women in college ( " and they looked back " she says with an idiotic triumphal flip of the head ) . 

this is all just ridiculous . 

i agree with others about the sound of the dvd ( i had to keep it at maximum volume and repeatedly rewind to understand names , phrases ) . 

this is a film by someone who really despises traditional heroics by any man , hates the notion that a man is needed to raise a child , loathes the idea that there is any necessary connection between marriage and sex . the film is out to preach - and that kind of propaganda of false messages doesn ' t sit well .  the original " psycho " ( 1960 ) is widely considered as alfred hitchcock ' s best work and certainly , in my opinion , is one of the best movies of all time . the decision to film a shot by shot remake is therefore , a little puzzling . 

the cast in the original was flawless , so the cast of this remake had a lot to live up to . vince vaughn as norman bates was not a good choice for the lead . he is too much of a pretty boy hunk and is not very convincing as bates . i can imagine actors such as mark wahlberg or john turturro doing a much better job in the role . anne heche as marion crane does a creditable job , but one keeps mentally comparing her to janet leigh . julianne moore is a much better actress than she shows here and viggio mortenson merely walks through his role . the best of this new cast is william h . macy as the private detective . 

although director gus van sant does an acceptable job , he can ' t build the suspense the way hitchcock did . and why did he change the scene in the basement of the house ? in the original , the atmosphere is dark and damp and closed in , whereas in this version , it takes place in a brightly lit laboratory like setting . and i think the black & white photography of the original has a definite advantage over the color version . 

maybe another flaw could be the fact that most moviegoers have seen the original and know what is going to happen and when . 

all i can say is if it ain ' t broke , don ' t fix it . 

 frank tashlin ' s ' censored ' is a so-so private snafu short which aims to teach the importance of the censor in stopping military secrets from leaking out . snafu attempts to get word out to his girlfriend that he ' s to be stationed in the south pacific but the censor foils each attempt he makes to send the letter . these early scenes are the best , with the unseen censor plucking the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms , nets and even a specially employed eagle ! the second half of the cartoon , in which snafu manages to send the letter with the aid of technical fairy , first class ( who is actually teaching him a lesson ) , is less funny and climaxes with a disappointing only-a-dream finale . the main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of snafu ' s extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen bare-breasted , albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times ! aimed at the military , the snafu shorts were often characterised by a heightened bawdiness but these scenes , crowbarred in as they may be , are by far the most erotic i ' ve come across in any of these shorts thus far . despite all this , i prefer the snafu shorts that go for the jugular a little more , usually resulting in the death of the main character . for great examples of this , seek out tashlin ' s ' the goldbrick ' or chuck jones ' s ' spies ' . ' censored ' is fairly weak by comparison .  when i was 8 years old , and going through my marx brothers phase , my father read in the tv guide that they were showing the marx brothers film , " the big store " late on friday night , and set the vcr to tape it for me . when i woke up on saturday -- due no doubt to a misprint in the tv guide -- my father and i discovered " the story of mankind " had been recorded instead . 

 " the big store " was probably one of the least funny of all the marx brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the century ' s finest works of cinema when compared with " the story of mankind . " i can almost justify tv guide ' s error , in that the marx brothers -- groucho , chico , and harpo -- appear in both movies . although in " the story of mankind , " they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes : groucho plays peter minuit , chico plays some guy talking to christopher columbus , and harpo plays isaac newton ? ? ? ? ? harpo ' s scene lasts about half a minute ; chico only has two or three lines ; groucho ' s scene is at least funny , but horribly racially insensitive by today ' s standards . the rest of the movie doesn ' t bear mentioning . they trotted out some of the finest actors of the day , and made them recite total garbage . what a disappointment . 

tv guide , i sent you a nice letter , i ' m still waiting for an apology . 

for the record : " the big store " has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the marx brothers on roller skates , and a couple of songs by virginia o ' brien . i was really looking forward to seeing it .  rabbit fever is one of those film oddities . it ' s an enjoyable 90 minutes , demands little of the viewer , and delivers as much , and on any terrestrial television channel even in a prime time slot i think that rabbit fever would be rather well received . which makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemas . 

the movie is filmed in the style of a television documentary , and introduces us to 6 women who have am addictive relationship with the rabbit vibrator . the film is primarily focused on investigating a supposed addictive quality to the famous sex aid product . the narrative is 100 % tongue in cheek throughout . 

the storyline is strong , an introduction to some well rounded and likable characters , some enjoyable back-story , peripheral characters and situations develops into an engaging story , and pleasing conclusions . sadly there ' s nothing that feels clever or new . 

rabbit fever has some sharp moments , a few switches that hint at what the writers are capable of , and all credit to them it ' s not just 90 minutes of knob gags and innuendo , i could probably watch it with my mother . but there ' s a laziness about some of the scenes that holds it back , those moments went you are up for it , when you want it to be outrageous , and all you get is a dollop of sit-com . 

i chuckled , i left the theatre feeling empathy for the characters , but i also left with the bitter thought that someone had taken a 90 minute reel of made for tv , light entertainment and tried to put it into national cinema . 

i think rabbit fever achieves some of what it set out to do , it ' s a quirky subject , a rounded storyline , a well presented cast and a good diversion for 90 minutes . but there ' s nothing in this that can justify the extravagance of a movie theatre environment . quite the opposite - a few commercial breaks would have given the viewer chance to grab a breath of life that rabbit fever seems to lack .  there were so many classic movies that were made where the leading people were out-and- out liars and yet they are made to look good . i never bought into that stuff . the " screwball comedies " were full of that stuff and so were a lot of the fred astaire films . 

here , barbara stanwyck plays a famous " country " magazine writer who has been lying to the public for years , and feels she has to keep lying to keep her persona ( and her job ) . she even lies to a guy about getting married , another topic that was always trivialized in classic films . 

she ' s a new york city woman who pretends she ' s a great cook and someone who knows how to handle babies , etc . obviously she knows nothing and the lies pile up so fast you lose track . i guess all of that is supposed to be funny because lessons are learned in the end and true love prevails , etc . etc . please pass the barf bag . 

most of this film is not funny . stanwyck was far better in the film noir genre . as for dennis morgan , well , pass the bag again .  yep , edward g . gives us a retro view of the criminal defense world . first he ' s an overzealous prosecutor who sends the wrong man to the chair ( played passionately , albeit briefly by deforrest kelly ) , then he ' s so filled with remorse his only solace is the bottle . throw in a jaded romance , a genuinely rapid descent into penury and no qualms about who he defends , and next thing you know -- shazam ! black leg lawyer ( god i love that phrase ) . he sees the light just in time to save his jaded beloved from the chair . yawn . 

but really , the courtroom action is pure melodrama . see him punch out a witness , see him drink poison , see him argue passionately as he clutches a bullet hole in his breast . be prepared for melodrama . 

the hoot of the film though , is jayne russell . with curves defying the laws of gravity and an iq approached absolute zero , she is something to see . even sings a bit .  evan almighty ( 2007 ) * * steve carell , morgan freeman , lauren graham , johnny simmons , graham phillips , jimmy bennett , john goodman , wanda sykes , john michael higgins , jonah hill , molly shannon , ed helms , ( cameo : jon stewart as himself ) strained ' sequel ' to " bruce almighty " with carell ' s jerk anchorman evan baxter leaving tv to begin his stint as a freshman congressional rep has his hands full when god ( freeman reprising his holy role ; jim carrey wisely avoided the ' calling ' ) demands he build an ark like noah and the hilarity ensues ( or should have ) . the godforsaken sitcom-y script by steve oedekerk , joel cohen & alec sokolow is absolutely lame and only carell ' s amiable persona transcends his vain evan into something resembling a human being . the end result is a lot of bird poop gags and overall bloat ( reportedly costing $ 175 m for the cgi f / x ) . sykes steals the show as evan ' s sarcastic assistant . sacrilegiously unfunny . ( dir : tom shadyac )  personally , the book was a very well written , amazing , thrilling piece that was not brought to justice to the movie . watching the movie at 12 . 01 in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me , seeing that it affected the " different " outcome of the movie . there was something to be desired out of this movie , but all in all , it lacked in plot . 

for someone who has not read the book , i could see how this movie would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense . however to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times , i did not see the strong connection between the two : both the movie and the novel . 

with major characters missing ( such as maximilian kohler ) and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti , the plot of the movie was slightly strewn thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story . the hassassin too was portrayed as a common white man , compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a muslim ; his motives in the book are predominately based his ties with the illuminati , however , in the movie , his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand .  this picture is a bad and blown up rip off of the michael pohl short film extinct from 1995 . while michael pohl ' s idea was original and perfect for a short film setting , a sound of thunder ' s plot was poorly adapted from pohl ' s story and not fit for a full length feature film one would expect from a major hollywod studio . the tragic flooding situation that ruined the sets in prague was just one bad link in a long rusty film production chain in this case . for a studio to release such a product . . . it is a shame . especially for warner brothers , a studio which broke new effects grounds with shows like babylon 5 in 1993 . on television . visual effects for television shows pioneering cgi in episodic television in the mid nineties were way more sophisticated than what is brought to the screen in this picture . in cases like this , sad as it may be : can the film .  i want very much to believe that the above quote ( specifically , the english subtitle translation ) , which was actually written , not spoken , in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist , was meant to be self-referential in a tongue-in-cheek manner . but if so , director leos carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film . they are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that i have to conclude carax actually takes himself seriously here , or else has so much disdain for everyone , especially the viewing audience , that he can ' t be bothered letting anyone in on the joke . 

some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique , bizarre films because they do so with Ã©lan and unique personal style ( e . g . , david lynch and alejandro jodorowsky ) . others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story ( e . g . , krzysztof kieslowski , and david cronenberg ' s later , less bizarre works ) . in pola x , carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it . well , here it is : the pacing is erratic and choppy , in particular continuity is often dispensed with ; superfluous characters abound ( e . g . , the gypsy mother and child ) ; most of the performances are overwrought ; the lighting is often poor , particularly in the oft-discussed sex scene ; unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason ; and the list goes on . 

not to be completely negative , it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions . i liked the musical score , even the cacophonous industrial-techno music being played in the sprawling , abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film ( perhaps a reference to andy warhol ' s ' factory ' of the ' 60s ? ) . much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful , an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings . and , even well into middle-age , cathering deneuve shows that she still has ' it ' . her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn ' t sink into bathos . 

there was an earlier time when i would regard such films as " pola x " more charitably . experimentation is admirable , even when the experiment doesn ' t work . but carax tries nothing new here ; the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films , and after several decades of movie-viewing and literally thousands of films later , i simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal , poorly crafted tripe . at this early moment in the 21st century , one is left asking : with the exception of jean-pierre jeunet , are there * any * directors in france who know how to make a watchable movie anymore ? rating : 3 / 10 .  this one ' s a doozy . dating from 1949 , scene of the crime often plays more like a coen bros . movie set in the 1940 ' s and filmed in black and white , except that the writer ' s ear for pastiche here isn ' t quite so well-tuned -- maybe this can be seen instead as the forerunner to oscar-baiting schlock like road to perdition . frankly , it ' s a wonder that this film isn ' t considered a classic by film professors and critics everywhere , considering how much it offers in term of overly articulated mannerist thrills cloaked in false significance ( much like the grandaddy of all such " fake art " films , citizen kane , or anything by murnau . ) 

mgm is usually a studio that can do no wrong in my eyes , and i think any story , any atmosphere , even " gritty realism , " can only benefit from grotesque overaestheticization . you could say i ' m a disciple of the minnelli school . but it takes a certain light touch to write mannered tough-guy dialogue of the dashiell hammett stripe , a willingness , perhaps , to let maybe one or two scenes pass without a line like " careful , mr . wiggly , or you ' ll have thirteen fish to fry and no little wormies to catch them with . " i made most of that up -- " mr . wiggly , " unfortunately , made the cut -- but believe me , the dialogue is just that loonily inflated and riddled with non sequiturs . even the lead cop ' s wife played by arlene dahl speaks like she has a moon-shaped scar under one eye and the christian name rocco . by the time van johnson turns in his badge with the line , " i ' m sick to death of death and homicide , " you ' ll wonder how the writer ' s fixation with ornate literary devices -- in this case , zeugma -- could ever have been misconstrued as " street . " 

for those who have outgrown the naked gun series , this is the funniest cops-n-robbers film going .  i was so disappointed in this movie . i am very familiar with the case , having read not only mark fuhrman ' s book but also the far superior " a wealth of evil : the true story of the murder of martha moxley in america ' s richest community " by timothy dumas . anyone who watches murder in greenwich should be aware they ' re watching the mark fuhrman story , not the martha moxley story . this film is nothing more than an ego-trip for fuhrman . just watch his character strut around as if he is the second coming ( yes , even being ogled by women ) . the actors playing the kids look way too old for their roles and the flashbacks to the 1970s are totally unconvincing . if there is any hero to this story , it ' s martha ' s family , her mother dorothy and brother john . they kept this case alive for two decades before fuhrman walked into it in order to make a name for himself . they , and martha , deserve to have the true story told .  i was in this movie as an extra in the dallas filming in july 1975 . some of the things you see today , and take for granted in movie making , were implemented in this movie . the movie premise , the costumes , the special effects , the acting . it all was ahead of its time . it opened the door for movies such as " star wars , " the " terminator , " the " matrix , " and " x-men " movies . now people look at it and they say , " well this does not add up to this new special effects story . . . " it did not have any computer graphics and such as the new movies do these days . it did have a story , and a wonderful cast , and a hell of a director ! the places it was filmed like the dallas ' world trade center , and the zale building , and the ft . worth water gardens were at that time the most modern and futuristic backdrops in which to film . the director michael anderson was very creative and he tried to show a perfect future that was flawed by human desires and frailty ' s . it was my first film experience , the first of six films i have been in . just because it was filmed in texas does not make it any less a wonderful piece of filmmaker ' s art . watch it again and appreciate it more . this movie was the foundation that set the standard for many great films that we now enjoy . well , my hand is blinking . . . i got to run . santuary awaits . . .  on his recent maligned reality-show , mr . shore conceded his filmic oeuvre is best enjoyed stoned . no , he must have said " best watched . " while a healthy toke might see you through the end credits , there is little pleasure to be found , save some sporadic chuckling at the picture , not with it . titular hyphenate absence is the least grievance . other hyphenate , wholesome tiffani-amber thiessen ( i dare you to rub out that " saved by the bell " patina of purity ) is miscast as a rural vamp ; she ' s too round of face for treachery . mr . shore , himself occasionally displays the odd talent for mimicry ( i thought i recognized a jimmy stewart in there ) , however it is never aptly used . the trite fish-out-of-water formula has yet to be rendered with less grace . our hero , crawl has precious little wit to account for expeditiously charming his agrarian antagonists . ultimately , i had to announce it ' s been ascertained : the worst movie ever . p . s . as another fish , adam sandler fared better with " mr . deeds . " it may take a shore to appreciate a sandler .   " garden state " is another of these " indie " -type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real true-to-life human drama . oddly enough , the production is very good , so are the performances ( by some fairly big-name actors as well ) . where the picture is lacking is in zach braff ' s script , which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies . 

when you ' re as young as braff is , you haven ' t really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder . braff ' s experience looks to be from watching movies , then repeating the same trite clichÃ©s in his own movie . in garden state , he plays andrew largeman , a semi-successful hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in new jersey to bury his mother , who took her own life after suffering in a wheelchair for many years . he appears to have no feeling about any of this ; he has no relationship with his father , who blames him for causing his mother ' s paralysis in a freak accident as a six-year-old , and has no particular despondency over losing his mother ( in fact , he attends a party right after the burial to which he was invited by a friend of his , who works as a cemetery grave-digger ) . it all smacks heavily of " beautiful girls " , also about a guy who returns to his hometown to " find himself " and hang with his old friends , with a little " ordinary people " thrown in on the side . 

it ' s really a miracle braff could accomplish anything at all in his life , given his father and his useless friends ( i ' m surprised he didn ' t kill himself ) , who are still living their " lives " as though they ' re still in high school , partying with dumb bimbos , drinking and drugging , etc . none of them even recognize him from his tv role as the " retarded quarterback " ( natalie portman ' s character , the most aware person in the movie , does ) , and say things , like " hey , i remember you from junior year " . these guys are such losers , for them , watching television would be a cultural leap forward . even one friend , who made millions inventing a silent velcro , has no real reason to live , because his whole frame of reference is high school and partying . and you don ' t need big money to party like a high school sophomore . 

braff , it is revealed , is heavily medicated , which keeps from " feeling " and dealing with anything , really , like an adult would . then he meets sam ( natalie portman ) a sort-of lost girl , who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother like a 10-year-old in a bedroom that looks like a pink doll house blown up to life size . anyway , they fall in love , and braff learns to " feel " again . the clichÃ©s come fast and furious . braff has a long delayed heart-to-heart talk with his cold , distancing father and tells him what it is and the name of the game . in one scene , braff and portman are in the millionaire kid ' s house , playing touchy-feely is front of a giant fireplace , and the bit is so routine , so standard movie-schtick , i swear , i half-expected somebody to walk up and throw a sled into the fire . in another , braff visits a doctor ( ron liebman ) to get his junk refilled , and liebman tells him ( in easily the worst line in the movie ) " the body can play tricks on you . i once found my ex-best-friend ' s cufflinks in my wife ' s purse , and i didn ' t have an erection for a year and a half . " obviously , no licensed physician would ever say that , but it ' s dirtbag poetry , a nod from braff to , i guess , his loser friends to let them know he ' s still thinking of them , just as the " 37 " joke in " clerks " , was kevin smith ' s nod to his dirtbag buddies . 

anyway , braff finds true happiness and gets off the dope ; the story plays itself out predictably . but if you ' re going to have a movie that ' s wall-to-wall clichÃ©s , at least give it some charming performances to breathe some life into it . and braff does . he has the right sort of vacancy , of casual acceptance to make his role as the zonked-out andrew both real and poignant , and natalie portman ( also of beautiful girls ) gives the movie a big lift . with her tiny features and flickering expressions of mood , she just about steals the picture as his traveling companion . jean smart is surprisingly good as portman ' s mother , and peter saarsgard ( though much better in " shattered glass " ) is notable as the gravedigger friend . i would recommend " garden state " if you can ' t get enough storybook romance out of movies , but when people start hailing it as a masterpiece , they ' re just clueless . braff thinks you can take the same old tired plot , write in a few " f * * ks " and " awesomes " and slap on an acoustic rock soundtrack and that contemporizes the material . it doesn ' t .  not to be confused with michael ritchie ' s nasty 1975 beauty pageant spoof , this " smile " is a down-turned example of those good intentions paving the road to hell . 

the film parallels two stories : an impoverished chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise a facially-deformed orphan named ling ( yi ding ) , and a tv-spawned malibu family act out " gidget get birth control . " katie ( mika booram , the third olsen twin ) plays a spoiled , self-absorbed high schooler distanced from reality . her teacher ( sean astin ) paves the way for a school trip to china aimed at showing students how to work with deformed children . 

the film uses deformity as a means of suspense by treating ling like the frankenstein monster . kramer continually masks her deformity through hats , hoods and camera placement . this approach exploits the freak show quality inherent in the material . she may be uncomfortable with the way society views her and kramer ' s answer is to cover her up until the big reveal . why disturb your audience with such unpleasantness ? we see her face briefly at the end and only minutes before closing-credit snapshots of her after surgery disclose a swan beneath the harelip . it is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live ; what is imperative is ling being equally as hot and popular as katie . 

funding for the film came from a trust established by the late roy rogers and dale evans . they envisioned a heritage of quality family films . give me " son of paleface " any day .   " a bored television director is introduced to the black arts and astral projection by his girlfriend . learning the ability to separate his spirit from his body , the man finds a renewed interest in his life and a sense of wellbeing . unfortunately , the man discovers while he is sleeping , his spirit leaves his body and his uncontrolled body roams the streets in a murderous rampage , " according to the dvd sleeve ' s synopsis . 

the synopsis isn ' t entirely correct , as it turns out . 

anyway , the movie opens with a dizzying " out-of-body " example of handsome director winston rekert ( as paul sharpe ) ' s newly discovered " astral body " experience ; it also foreshadows an upcoming dogfight . young andrew bednarski ( as matthew sharpe ) , being a kid , draws pictures of " the blue man " , as his murder spree begins . handsome detective john novak ( as stewart kaufman ) discovers the victims are connected to mr . rekert . mr . novak ' s investigation leads to the supernatural ; a prime example of which is karen black ( as janus ) , with whom rekert fears he is falling in love . 

several in the cast perform well ; but , " the blue man " winds up tying itself up in a knot . aka " eternal evil " , its unsatisfying story tries to be far too clever for its own good .  it may have been thrilling for an audience in 1946 , but the movie is now a bit boring . i had a hard time sitting through the whole thing , and it was very predictable : i mean , we know from the beginning of the movie that welles is the nazi war criminal , and i ' ll give you one guess as to whether he is caught and appropriately punished in the end . 

not worth watching . it ' s sad that welles only made three movies worth seeing in his long career : kane , ambersons , and a touch of evil .  i ' ve read the book ' scarlett ' and was expecting a good movie the first time i saw it . i ' m afraid to say that i was disappointed . the movie did not follow the book and made many changes that i did not like . 

one of the changes that i did not like the way that lord fenton was portrayed . it made no sense to make him out to be a bad man . the way that things ended between lord fenton and scarlett was a lot different and their whole relationship was too intimate . 

there was also a lot less confrontation between scarlett and rhett in the movie than was originally written in the book . the movie sent the two in two completely opposite ways and they did not seem to cross paths often enough to make it seem like there still could be love between the two . a fine movie , but i believe that it certainly could ' ve been better than it was , had it more true to alexandra rippley ' s book .  not a balanced point of view . the director shouldn ' t express her opinion as truth . the movie has some criticism of fujimori but it always gives him and his family the last words . so few critics of fujimori were provided that it seems the only reason they were included was to be able to say the movie provides both views . but that is not the case . 

the movie barely shows one of the massacres that fujimori is accused of . and it gives him credit for the masterminding the murdering of the mrta insurgents that took the japanese embassy . it is well documented that the cia did the planning . there is even pictures of a well known cia strategist on the site published by caretas magazine and other newspapers . 

the fact that such well known information was not used by the director gives us a few possible conclusions : the director is pro-fujimori and purposely and falsely chooses to give the credit to him ; the director does not want viewers to note that the cia and fujimori worked together ; or it was just out of ignorance since the director is not peruvian and was not present in peru at the time the events occurred . 

the explanation provided by other commentators , that fujimori is still fairly popular in peru , does not excuse the lack of accuracy and balanced explanations . 

also , the statistics provided in the movie for the actual support of fujimori were the highest i have ever heard of . most statistics by major poll agencies are much lower . 

another point to mention is that the intelligence that was key in the capture of the leader of sendero and discover the secret network was done by a police force led by ketin vidal and he had complete autonomy from fujimori and montesinos . 

the first government of fujimori did experience an improvement in overall economic trends ( gdp ) but this improvement was financed by the privatization of several national industries with contracts that were not beneficial for the country in the long term . also , the gap between rich an poor continued to increase during fujimori ' s regime . in his second term the economy was suffering and there was nothing else to privatize and by the end of fujimori ' s second term the economy was about to collapse . 

in terms of investments in infrastructure of fujimori ' s regime , they fallow the paternalistic pattern . they were created to raise support for fujimori but were not meant to last long . these structures needed continued maintenance but fujimori did not provide political power for the civilians in order to demand further investment . in fact , fujimori ' s regime was able to destroy most forms of political organizing such as unions and grass-roots groups and the increase in informal unorganized labor was immense . 

finally , the director chose to spend most of the movie talking to fujimori instead of citing the cases of massive corruption in favour of fujimori ( the media , business owners , the military , etc ) that were so wide spread it was impossible that fujimori was not aware of it .  i do not generally appreciate light-weight attempts at creating humourous stories , which means that " anita no perd el tren " cannot score very high for me . the story is good : a middle-aged but still good-looking woman finds a new love . but the attempts at making this film as a romantic comedy only managed at times to be somewhat comical . 

rosa marÃ­a sardÃ  has ably demonstrated that she can be a serious actress in such productions as " amic / amat " ( qv ) , " todo sobre mi madre " ( qv ) , " las amargas lÃ¡grimas de petra von kant " ( qv ) and " el embrujo de shanghai " ( qv ) . however the powers that be have over the years dished her out a lot of trivial stuff , for the cinema and for tv . something similar could be said of josÃ© coronado : perfectly able to produce serious performances . marÃ­a barranco belongs safely in this grouping . 

such that , in the end , i was left with the feeling that i would be real pleased to see a new making of this film , in a serious tone , which would allow the actors to really show their performing skills . and the curious thing is that it should be done with exactly the same leading actors . wasted talent on a rather silly film that could have been very promising indeed .  while the design and locations and photography are strong assets in this film ; it is a turgid and melodramatic affair which demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey truth . 

the case is the use of the soundtrack music : a mix of gustav mahler and andrew lloyd-webber that plays constantly and loudly , and would have made max steiner grimace at its over use as it instructs the audience how difficult ; how ecstatic ; how tortured it is to be an artist . and then it really counts the story elides the details at the end . 

this heightened and kitsch exploitation of emotions was once well ridiculed by peter ackroyd about a yukio mishima book : this is not writing , this is barbara cartland . precisely the same critique can be made of this film : a deceptive , mawkish vanity project .  douglas sirk ' s inaugural " women ' s-picture " weepy for universal , based on a preachy , dogmatic , didactic novel by the intolerable lloyd c . douglas ( author of that other beloved piece of crap , * the robe * ) . rock hudson , in the role that catapulted him to stardom , plays bob merrick , a drunken playboy worth untold millions who is more interested in chasing skirts and racing speedboats than in finishing his medical degree . in the first scene , he wrecks his boat on a sumptuously photographed lake . the accident nearly kills merrick , and thus he requires a rather mysterious " resuscitator machine " to keep him alive . . . meanwhile , across town , beloved surgeon dr . phillips finally drops dead from a heart condition . since the local hospital can maintain only one resuscitator at a time , phillips dies so that the louse may live . when merrick learns of this , he tries to make apologetic overtures to phillips ' family , especially to the widow ( jane wyman , coiffed and clothed in matronly hauteur ) , but indeed anyone and everyone who knew the surgeon spits at merrick like a brace of cobras . one doctor on the hospital staff even calls it " a total waste " that the playboy lived instead of the christ-like surgeon . hippocrates might have had something to say about that ! 

these early scenes are where you ' ll find the typical sirkian iconoclasm : the director rubs our faces so much in the unpleasantness of middle-class , mid-century america , that one finds oneself rooting for the wastrel playboy to put whoopee-cushions under the ramrod fannies of these moral hypocrites . but , alas , no : the risible plot of the novel must proceed , and merrick soon finds himself getting converted by god , in the guise of pipe-puffing otto kruger , an artist who claims that phillips made him a better man and even a better painter . ( why don ' t we see any of this amazing art ? ) we learn that the intolerably ubiquitous dr . phillips would often refuse payment for medical services rendered ( though who exactly qualified for these " magnificent exemptions " is never made clear ) . this is supposed to provide our hero with a whole new outlook on life and an example of personal conduct . kruger even tries to make it all sound very illicitly exciting : " once you start this thing , there ' s no way out of it ! it ' s an obsession . . . a magnificent obsession ! " so merrick tries it out by again pestering the widow with apologetic overtures , but he somehow causes her to get hit by a car . she loses her eyesight . apparently , merrick will have several more stations-of-the-cross to trudge past before he can be accounted a decent fellow . 

but sirk continues to sneak in his revenges even as the movie grows more and more preachy . the most obvious bit has to be the presence of agnes moorehead as the head hospital nurse and wyman ' s friend and unrequited lesbian lover . note the disappointment on moorehead ' s face when merrick , finally redeemed as a doctor , shows up to save wyman ' s life near the end . hudson ' s own homosexuality , an open secret in hollywood at the time , is also used to great ironic effect . he and wyman -- dowdy and fifteen years older -- generate absolutely zero erotic heat in their scenes together , which , by the way , are purposefully few , presumably because any more scenes between the stars would hopelessly expose this whole enterprise . ( one thing we feel certain of : if rock hudson was obsessed by anything , it certainly wasn ' t jane wyman . ) it ' s a chronic case of * tea and sympathy * . sirk seemed to enjoy tweaking everyone ' s noses by having this gay actor -- who was attractive to the innocent ladies of the era -- coolly drift through these exquisitely-colored " women ' s pictures " . in fact , the director worked with hudson 6 or 7 more times , to best effect in the follow-up to this film , * all that heaven allows * , which re-teamed hudson with wyman but was also accompanied by a realistic plot . in * obsession * , meanwhile , we must endure god / kruger gazing beneficently down from an observation-window onto merrick and his medical team as they prepare to save wyman ' s life , in tandem with a musical score of swelling vocals from a cheesy hollywood choir . 

but to see why sirk is considered an auteur , check out the scene wherein wyman explains to her grown daughter that she can in fact tell the difference from night and day . the entire frame is blackened , here : the daughter is barely visible , and wyman ' s face is faintly silhouetted against a faint light . she goes on to say that she hates the night because " i know that dawn will never come again " . a great , chilling moment that deserves a much better movie than * magnificent obsession * . 

4 stars out of 10 .  although the figures are higher in proportion to other areas of society , i don ' t object to the extremely high salaries for many of today ' s entertainers and athletes . 

a-rod , lebron or brady all have deals either well with 8 figures , or the low-9 area . ray romano and jerry seinfeld could actually become billionaires from their shows , huge residuals and fees they currently demand . even their cast members , and all of the " friends " group reached near or over 7 figures per episode . letterman ' s earnings for one show could solve most people ' s financial problems , and a week or two ' s take care of many for life . 

but all of these are based upon sound supply / demand principals , and the financial benefits they bring to their employers . and all perform their crafts ably . 

but then comes along someone like rachel ray , who reaches a level of earnings far beyond any apparent level of talent or skill . i find her shrill , annoying , and with a forced " perkiness " that ' s as phony as the proverbial " 3-dollar bill . " 

a friend of mine is responsible for special meetings , events and convention plans for her firm and its affiliates . one of the major talent sources has hundreds of clients available from the $ 5-10k level , to a handful who get $ 200k and up per appearance . ( this area includes trump , seinfeld , lance armstrong , robin williams , and , no kidding , larry the cable guy . ) 

there are a greater number in the $ 100 , 001 - 200 , 000 range ; list included the likes of bill cosby , steve martin and even cable guy larry ' s benefactor , jeff foxworthy . 

this category includes rachael ray . i suppose i have to admit there may be sufficient demand for her " talent " and offerings to justify her talk show and there may be some out there who ' ll pay more than $ 100k , + first class air , hotel suite , all expenses and limos door-to-door , for just a couple of hours of her whiny prattle at their organization ' s event . 

i just can ' t figure how-in-the-hell this could be possible .  the `plot ' of this film contains a few holes you could drive a massive truck through , but i reckon that isn ' t always top priority in horror . two elderly sisters in rural england keep their brother in the cellar since more than 30 years . now , he escaped and started a killing spree , focusing on militaries that are homed nearby . `we only did we thought was best for him ' they keep on repeating and Â strangely Â all the army officers love these women and don ' t doubt their sincerity , even though 5 of their men died . i don ' t know whether to find the revelation near the end suspenseful or tedious ! in a way , this film reminded me about `arsenic and old lace ' . in that black-comedy classic , two half-insane siblings mother their goofy younger brother as well , yet they do the killing there . the old ladies in `the beast in the cellar ' are by no means less crazy , though . the `horror ' in this early 70 ' s film is very amateurish and cheap , but there are a few neat attempts to build up the tension . too many `old-ladies ' talk about the good ol ' days , though and that rarely is something you seek in a horror film with such an appealing title . flora robson , who may be recognized by classic film buffs , plays one of the sisters . she gave image to the queen of england is the legendary errol flynn swashbuckler film , the sea hawk .  there is a phrase by the experimental filmmaker nathaniel dorsky , who says some films are structured like a camera mounted on the head of a dog who goes down an alley , sniffing everything along the way . 

that ' s how this movie is . the structure is " kurosawa started out as a baby , then he became a kid , then a young man , then a movie director , then he started making ' masterpieces ' , then he grew old , the end . " the word ' masterpiece ' is used a lot in this film to describe kurosawa ' s output , without explaining * what * makes his films so good / great . just because the off-screen narrator reading a script says that a film is a masterpiece , are we supposed to kiss his rear-end and accept that a certain movie is one of the great works of art of the 20th century ? and one more point . the voice of paul scofield is used as the voice of kurosawa , when excerpts from the director ' s memoirs are being read off screen . he brings pear-shaped shakespearean tones to the text . . . but why him ? ? if you were making a documentary about billie holiday , would you use dame judi densch as her voice ? ? ? ?  for everyone who has read this book , fanny price ends up maturing into her own woman , a beautiful woman . . . with a brain . le touzel looks like she is on medication . terrible acting , she just ruins it ! henry is a little tall for his character . he is also too effeminate . mary crawford is brilliant . edmond is a little too old . mrs . norris is hysterical- ok , this casting decision works . rushworth is also perfect . yates looks too effeminate also . but , le touzel is simply horrid . this is not a good character for her . poor fanny ! i would recommend this movie only because it includes an almost complete textual account of the language austen uses in the novel . the 1999 version is much more fun but terribly incomplete . if they could redo this version with a better suited actress for fanny it would be fabulous !  early 1950s sci-fi directed by lesley selander . special effects of course are very primitive , but pretty good in comparison to what else was out there then . drive-in movie double feature fare ; still interesting enough to watch . two leading men , arthur franz the brilliant young scientist dr . jim barker and straight talking and earthy newspaper reporter steve abbot ( cameron mitchell ) are joined on a manned flight to mars by carol stafford ( virgina huston ) another scientist and two other space experts ( richard gaines and john litel ) . upon landing on the red planet , the space travelers encounter inhabitants that appear friendly and mentally advanced . in actuality , the martians are led by ikron ( morris ankrum ) , who has the idea of conquering earth to vitalize their civilization . there is a beautiful martian ( maruerite chapman ) that dr . barker intends to take back on the return trip . she is the movie ' s redeemable element .  this movie would receive a much higher vote from me in general and i will talk about why , but first and foremost it receives four stars and should stay at four stars because of the directors ridiculously tasteless portrayal of rape and sexual assault . not far into the movie oyama sexually assaults a woman he rescued earlier , and while she briefly becomes somewhat miffed by his actions this attitude only lasts about five minutes before loving adoration sets in and carries her character through the rest of the film . i know many will argue that it ' s not that important in a kung fu beat-em-up , and as a fan of the genera i can ' t say that it ' s all that unusual , but that doesn ' t stop it from being completely tasteless every time i see it . 

what i will say in this movie ' s defence however is that it ' s somewhat refreshing to see a martial arts , or even action movie of any sort , that offers no actual hero for the viewer to get behind . oyama is portrayed as a rapist and murderer ; a societal outcast whose only student becomes completely mentally unbalanced before being gunned down by the police . the final shots of the movie leave one with the feeling that oyama himself is poised for a major breakdown and no longer seems to care for the woman he earlier assaulted into loving him and has since followed him with puppy-dog like devotion . 

whether this was truly the intended message of the movie or not , one can ' t help but feel a little hopeful that oyama might be on the brink of suicide by the time the movie is over . this is a rare emotional treatment from the martial arts genre and its interesting to see a film that leaves you with a sense that its violence is not to be celebrated . if only karate bullfighter had treated the subject of sexual violence better , either by creating more emotional depth and recognition between the two characters involved , or by leaving it out all together , this would have been a much more interesting film .  in the early 1990 ' s " step-by-step " came as a tedious combination of the ultra-cheesy " full house " and the long-defunct loopy classic hit " the brady bunch " . the differences between " step-by-step " and the two aforementioned shows was of course better writing , excellent comedic timing from almost all of it ' s actors , and a great deal funnier situations that weren ' t quite as sugar-coated as it ' s extremely popular predecessors . admittedly though , even with the big boosts in the show ' s basic dynamics and all it still wasn ' t exactly spectacular , nor was it really even that memorable in the long line of corny family programming ! it was just a much better time-passer , you might say , in comparison to the cutesy migraine-inducing " full house " , which coincidentally , ran neck-and-neck with " step-by-step " during that time period in terms of overall popularity . the show , now in syndication obviously , is certainly suitable family-fare but be sure to not expect much beyond that when watching it .  peter hunt started out as a very gifted film editor and got his first stab at directing when he helmed the james bond film " on her majesty ' s secret service " ( considered by many bond fans to be the best of the series ) . other titles in his filmography include epic scale adventure movies like " gold " and " shout at the devil " , both adapted from wilbur smith novels . " gulliver ' s travels " is an odd one on his list of films ; it seems strange that a director of hunt ' s style and expertise would choose to direct a film of this kind . a half-live action / half-animated retelling of jonathan swift ' s classic satire , the film looked twenty years out of date even when it was made , and in all honesty it simply doesn ' t work . and there ' s not a damn thing that hunt ( with his usual eye for fast-paced action ) , or star richard harris ( who can usually enliven the most stilted of roles ) can do to rescue this one . 

lemuel gulliver ( richard harris ) is a brilliant medical student living in 17th century bristol . his father ( norman shelley ) wants him to go to london to make his fortune ; but gulliver prefers the idea of receiving rather less pay but a heck of a lot more adventure as a ship ' s surgeon aboard a ship called the ' antelope ' . during a voyage , the ' antelope ' is blown off course during a storm and hits a reef . the ship sinks and everyone is lost , apart from gulliver . who finds himself washed ashore in the kingdom of lilliput . when he comes round , gulliver finds that the strange land where he has washed ashore is populated by incredibly small humans , no taller than his toe . to them , he looks like a giant . they persuade gulliver to help them in a war against another race of tiny people who live on an adjacent island . but gulliver doesn ' t like being manipulated for purposes of war and devastation , so he makes plans to escape . 

harris is left to carry the entire film here . his first couple of scenes involve other actors , but once he is shipwrecked in lilliput he spends the rest of the film striding over knee-high sets and acting alongside his animated counterparts . the idea of mixing live action and animation was not new at the time , but it certainly hadn ' t been done a lot . a few disney movies like song of the south , so dear to my heart and pete ' s dragon had tampered with the idea , but it was still pretty much in its infancy . " gulliver ' s travels " is not an especially well-animated film , but the scenes showing interaction between harris and his cartoon co-stars are at least competently done . occasionally the film tries to be true to its satirical origins ( there ' s one scene where we learn that lilliput has gone to war with its neighbour because of eggs ! ? ! - and the point seems to be that wars can begin over the most ridiculous of things ) . but at its heart , this is very much a kids ' film and the satirical overtones are barely dwelled upon . everyone involved has done better things during their career Â " gulliver ' s travels " might fill an otherwise empty afternoon , but apart from that it is a forgettable and underwhelming experience .  this is the second adaptation of charlotte armstrong by claude chabrol for the screen : the first was " la rupture " ( 1970 ) ( from novel " the balloon man " ) and it ' s really a pity no one cares about it . it ' s chabrol ' s sleeper , and i urge any of his fans to see it . 

 " the chocolate " cobweb was not that strong a detective story to begin with . i read it 20 years ago and forgot all about it . the movie promises some good things at first , though , then finally disappoints to a fault . this is a confusing chabrol movie , mixing elements of the heyday ( circa 1969 ) , and a lotta tongue-in-chick stuff coming from the eighties , the likes of ' poulet au vinaigre " , not one particularly memorable work . 

part of the disappointment comes from the cast : this is a distressingly poor gathering : jacques dutronc plays like a zombie , isabelle huppert reveals herself a somewhat limited actress , finally rather vulgar . it worked in " une affaire de femme " , it does not here . they are not supported by the young couple : both are bland and unremarkable . actors from the past , say , stephane audran or michel bouquet ( both in " la rupture " ) were brilliant and contributed to chabrol ' s then unique atmosphere . 

the story itself is undistinguished : beginning as some kind of " serious " " la vie est un long fleuve tranquille " ( besides , a character hints at etienne chatilliez ' s very funny movie ) , the movie drags on and on as a laughable psychological drama afterwards . we will not congratulate the young female pianist , who , after all she learned about her wicked hostess , agrees to drive a car along a dangerous road . 

because he makes too many movies , chabrol frequently releases turkeys . one wonder why people who wants to watch one of his movies should choose this one among all his stuff up for grabs . 

it seems that chabrol ' s bourgeoise satire has finally given way to leniency . in " la rupture " the first armstrong adaptation-an average detective story which chabrol completely transcended- , you should hear audran say " they have so much money ! " . here , chabrol has lost his bite , his strength .  i watched this series out of curiosity , wanting to see if they could possibly and with all this modern technology , out do cecil b . demille ' s classic epic of 1956 , starring charleton heston , yul brenner and sir cedric hardwicke . of course , i was let down . yes , they had all the biblical characters correct , but they didn ' t give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes , that held your interest throughout the first movie . if you going to have a mini-series , you have to have some " rivoting " scenes , the " burning bush " , parting the " red sea " , drowning " pharohs armies " , " building sethi ' s pyramids " , could have been done with todays ' technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as " lord of the rings " or the matrix . obviously , they didn ' t want to leave a lasting impression of " faith and sacrifice " , which is much needed in these trouble times .  if good intentions were enough to produce a good film , i would have rated the turgid , ponderous , obvious " focus " a bit higher than 4 . macy does his best , but as an earlier poster commented , miller ' s little parable asks us to suspend disbelief too often . perhaps the novel gives us a bit more background on newman , so we can understand how someone who is obviously not without intelligence could be so dense in perceiving the attitudes of those around him . i agree with another reviewer that if one is unaware of how bigoted average citizens were in america during this time period , then this movie might be an eye-opener . i grew up in the fifties , and the " good " pastors of my lutheran church found nothing wrong with having the church picnic at a commercial beach , whose sign prominently indicated that no jews or blacks would be admitted . it is difficult for young people today to understand that this was the norm , and not just in the south . as late as 1964 , when i graduated from a somewhat racially integrated ( but sexually segregated ) public high school in baltimore , my black classmates could not attend the traditional " father and son banquet , " as it was held at a facility which did not admit blacks . sadly , it was an establishment owned by a jewish family . the subject matter of " focus " is important , and we should never forget , despite the lingering signs of racism in modern america , how truly repulsive the attitudes of that previous generation were . ( the " greatest generation , " indeed ) . so , perhaps this film is somewhat valuable in countering the recent wave of sentimental crap about the forties from the likes of steven spielberg and tom brokow . but in the end , as in " far from heaven , " the filmmakers ' good intentions are undermined by having a protagonist so ridiculously oblivious to the social conventions of their time .  herman has made northern drama his own with little voice and brassed off , but the formula falters in this ropey , flat and contrived tale of two teenage delinquents trying to get season tickets to see newcastle . 

truancy , underage smoking and drinking , underage sex , teenage abortion , school bullying , drug abuse , substance abuse , depression , child violence , child sex abuse , shoplifting , housebreaking , auto theft , violent assault and armed robbery all put in an appearance here . none of these issues are explored , they merely serve to move the story along from one implausible situation to another . the film is not as acutely observed as trainspotting , as poignant as the full monty , or as reflective of the times as wonderland ( from which it shamelessly steals music in an overly-manipulative manner ) . i suspect none of the filmmakers are from newcastle , and have certainly never experienced the social problems the film references . i am all for entertainment , and herman ' s track record shows he is aware of the need to balance the social message with laughs and tears . quite simply , he comes up incredibly short here . 

the film has a nice ending , but there are far too many flat , banal moments to sit through to get there . nicely shot , not very well acted , and ultimately fails on three crucial points : script , script , script .  there was a time when joel schumacher was ranked quite high on my list of favorite directors . back in the late 80 ' s and early 90 ' s , when his name was attached to several great films like " the lost boys " , " flatliners " and " falling down " , he truly was one of the most gifted directors in hollywood . then came the stupid " batman " sequels , unfortunately , and after that it seemed as if every potentially sublime screenplay turned into a gigantic mess in schumacher ' s hands . both " 8mm " and " phone booth " could have been much better films and even the incredibly imbecilic concept of " the number 23 " should have been processed into a slightly more compelling and entertaining movie . literally from start to finish , " the number 23 " desperately attempts to be a mysterious and uncanny thriller and therefore uses all the dreadful clichÃ©s from the big book of cinema history , including heavy-voiced narration , flashbacks , disorderly structure , characters with multiple personalities , numerous plot twists that grow increasingly absurd and sinister asylum settings . nothing helps , however , simply due to the sheer silliness of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired engagement of cast & crew . as much as you try to associate with the lead character and be open-minded regarding the insane theories , this still remains a movie about a two-digit number and two-digit numbers aren ' t scary . walter sparrow ( jim carrey in a rare non-comical role ) is a bored animal trapper whose wife agatha gives him a bizarre book on his birthday . the book tells about all sorts of devilish theories and strange coincidences that are linked to the number 23 . walter almost promptly identifies himself with the book ' s protagonist ( a sleazy detective investigating a grim case of suicide ) and begins to spot copious examples of the 23 enigma in his own private life . i did some research on google and wikipedia and , apparently , this whole 23 numerology nonsense really exists and certain people honestly believe that most catastrophes and accidents are directly connected to this evil number . well , that ' s just crazy ! but hey , i ' m not here to judge people ' s beliefs and fears , regardless of how demented they are , and i can only share my humble opinion on a movie that is based on an out-and-out berserk enigma . " the number 23 " is not suspenseful , in spite of several gloomy set pieces and nasty make-up effects , and never at one point manages to make you contemplate about the role of numbers in your own life . all cast members perform below their normal capacities , but it was still nevertheless a joy to see the lovely mrs . virginia madsen in a relatively big production again . definitely not recommended in case you ' re looking for a solid and creepy evening of thriller fun , but endurable and not entirely without merit .  this owes a great deal to the plot of captains courageous . although he is quite grown up , it is partly the story of a wealthy lad who is shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo vessel and becomes a man in the process . moran of the title is a boyish young woman also brought up on a vessel owned by her father . when the cargo burns , she and crew members are evacuated to our lad ' s ship . however , the captain has smuggling on his mind and his intentions are not honorable where moran is concerned . the inevitable ensues - our lad falls for the mannish moran and she for him . in the end evil is subdued and the lovers are united . some interesting dialogue points out that moran belongs to no man - " and no woman . " ( a nod to sappho here ) . dorothy dalton is appropriately sexless as moran and not too attractive either . valentino does well in a romantic , action role . his sexy build and physique are shown off to advantage and the role is quite a masculine one . he is very appealing . this is no great film but it passes the time . what it really showcases is valentino ' s beauty and sexiness .  pdq bach did it better . much of " bach " ' s speaking part is letters written to various patrons complaining about the amount and speed of his payment . anna magdalena ' s diary , mostly about the death of children and sundry other family matters , is an iota more engaging . the music is disconcerting : 17th century sized chapel orchestras and choirs producing 20th century concert hall sound . the overall production quality reminded me of a junior high slide show . j s bach was a brilliant man whose music speaks for itself . this film adds nothing . netflix sent me 2 discs that wouldn ' t play , so i streamed the movie . clearly netflix was trying to tell me something .  sammi cheng & andy lau are coupled yet again in their 3rd film -- yesterday once more -- directed by hk ' s actioneer johnnie to . . . fans of to ' s action films will be disappointed to find not a single gun was used in the filming . . . furthermore , fans of cheng & lau ' s previous films , needing you & love on a diet , will also be disappointed to find that yesterday is no where near as funny or endearing . . . 

mr . & mrs . to ( lau & cheng ) are a divorced couple . . . both affluent hk citizens . . . both incredibly mischievous . . . both just happened to be professional thieves -- ' two birds of the same feather ' . . . . a couple years earlier , they divorced over an inability to find middle ground on splitting the loot . . . now she ' s remarrying . . . to the son of a rich heiress -- a total momma ' s boy ( carl ng ) through & through . . . the soon-to-be mother-in-law ( jenny woo ) is suspicious of mrs . to ' s past & thinks she ' s only marrying her son for the family jewels -- the heiress ' priceless ruby necklace . . . 

the necklace is stolen . . . is it mrs . to ' s materialistic eye that gets the best of her ? . . . or is it her ex-husband , mr . to ' s way of sabotaging the marriage to steal the jewels for himself ? . . . 

this is not a movie about two pple falling in love or rekindling a love . . . its about two pple who have always been in love but have somehow been to foolish to realize it . . . they let pride & greed overwhelm them . . . 

overall : yesterday is one part caper / heist film & one part homage to classic hollywood glamour from its golden years -- i . e . cary grant & grace kelly ' s to catch a thief . . . johnnie to is riding too heavily on cheng / lau ' s chemistry from their previous films . . . hoping cheng / lau ' s immense popularity & fan base will be enough justification for this third film . . . . i think sammi cheng is one of the most likable / charming entertainers working t ' day . . . & lau is definitely the tom cruise of asian cinema . . . 

i really enjoyed their first two films & consider the cheng / lau pairing comparable to those classic hollywood couples of the 40 ' s & 50 ' s . . . but yesterday falls very short of expectations . . . terrible writing , ridiculous situations , product placements galore , & all the subplots & supporting characters were unnecessary . . . come to think of it . . . this film was unnecessary . . . unless you just love celebrity watching . . .  an atrocious offense to the memory and genius of welles , this senseless assemblage of self-indulgent improvisation on a grand theme should have been locked up in storage along with a number of other unfinished welles ' projects no one has ever seen . now we know why ! to add additional insult to prior injury , the appalling english language dubbing by amateur america dubbing actors and even the great man himself only heightens all the sloppy mistakes in story-telling and construction . it ' s as if every weekend some good hearted spanish soul gave orson a few pesos , a 35mm camera and some short-ends of negative film left over from some other production and told welles to drive out to the spanish countryside and just keeping shooting anything and everything until the film stock ran out . it ' s true that if orson had really shaped this film himself instead the notorious jesus franco , he might have thrown out 85 % of what he shot , but we will never know . as welles never took the time to edit his own work here , and somewhere along the way he or his heirs sanctioned someone else to do so , he is not entirely blameless for the debacle . those who wish to prove that in his early days welles was the luckiest of young men because he surrounded himself with the likes of john houseman , herman mankewiecz , greg toland , bernard hermann and robert wise need no better proof of his adult inadequacies than this mess of a film . in his sad old age welles was capable of doing anything when he needed a few bucks or pesos , including selling his artistic soul . the devil certainly got his due with this one !  i find it disconcerting that in an era when satisfying and fulfilling spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered across the whole spectrum of possible beliefs , that a charlatan and fraud of gurdjieff ' s caliber ( as a charlatan , he is exceptional ; there is no denying he had a special gift . it ' s a pity he misused it , though , for the aggrandizement of his wounded ego , feeding on the adulation of unwary sheep who were at his beck and call and in awe of him ) can inspire such extreme adherence and credulity . this movie presents an idealized version of gurdjieff ' s own largely fictional and fantastic account of his formation and " awakening " ( which i would rather describe as his discovery of how much he could sway the minds and wills of certain types of sadly disoriented people ) . see it , if you dare to have a disagreeable eye-opening about how sadly deprived we are of true religious leaders , to the extent that a clown like gurdjieff could inspire such devotion - and be careful to have your blood pressure medicine at hand if you are one of those who still hope for a healthy religion to emerge from the ruins of christianity , as a supreme example of cinematography at the entire service of the premises and pretenses of a dysfunctional cult .  my god , the things that passed for entertainment in this country . . . 

this is * not * the " tom and jerry " you may have enjoyed on saturday mornings , featuring a hapless cat and a clever mouse . this is a much earlier animation series , featuring a pair of mutt-and-jeff clones who get themselves into various scrapes that result in any of the then-typical dancing-skeleton-type gags that made up so much of early animation . 

this particularly vile outing , apparently originally intended as a vehicle for a pair of actual black stage comedians of the time , has the pair crashing in the ocean while flying to africa , necessitating black-face make-up , exaggerated " negro " dialect and " feets , don ' t fail me now " situations . 

it only shows that in the 70 years between emancipation and this film , the american view of africans hadn ' t progressed much . then again , at least one of them apparently had a pilot ' s license .  despite having an absolutely horrid script ( more about that later ) , this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors , barbara stanwyck and henry fonda . aside from one or two real stinkers , i ' d probably watch just about anything with them in the film , as i am a huge fan of hollywood ' s golden age of the 1930s and 40s . however , no matter how much i love their films , i just can ' t recommend this film . 

the movie begins with fonda and stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort . the two haven ' t yet met , but the film begins loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which fonda horribly yodels while skiing . it was done so unsubtly and made my teeth grind but i stuck it out--especially when fonda fell into a snow bank and this stopped the yodeling ! ! in hindsight , perhaps i should have just turned it off then ! fonda is knocked out in the fall and barbara goes for help . back at the ski lodge , he seems okay but fortunately she is also a doctor and has him x-rayed and nurses him back to health . he , in turn , becomes infatuated with her and proposes to her . despite hardly knowing each other , they marry and so far the film seems like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy . 

once home , however , all isn ' t rosy as she jumps right back into her job as a family doctor and he begins exhibiting signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy . the film plays it all for laughs , but frankly fonda ' s behaviors were really creepy--spying on her and her male patients , attacking or threatening any man she treats , tripping a patient who already has a back injury and stomping into a surprise party and insisting that everyone there ( men and women ) are out to steal away his wife . he comes off as a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic , but it ' s all supposed to be for laughs . considering that he seems like a dangerous nut , you would think that stanwyck would file for an annulment along with a restraining order ! but , oddly , she gets mad but just can ' t stay mad at fonda because he ' s so . . . . . . . . ? i can ' t think of the right word-- ' creepy ' is all that comes to mind ! ! ! later , out of the blue , multi-millionaire fonda gets a job working the counter at a department store . then , through magical thinking , he and babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the past--so a job apparently cures anger and suspicions . when this job falls through , the film ends with fonda buying his own hospital , giving barbara a job there and they live happily ever after . they don ' t go any further with the story , but i assume based on fonda ' s character that he then spent most of his time as hospital administrator beating up all the male patients . 

the first portion at the ski lodge and the next did not fit well together , nor did the final " horatio alger " inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world . they were like three separate plots but despite this , the most serious problem with the film was its seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy ! what a creepy little film ! thank goodness neither fonda nor stanwyck are known for this yechy film but for all their other lovely films .  as an avid gone with the wind fan , i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters . luckily , the film on its own was a wonderful piece . when the book scarlett came out , i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together . while the book lacks any true quality , it remains a good story , and , as long as i was able to separate it from the original , was and still is enjoyable . however , i consider the six hours i spent watching the " scarlett " miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life . discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in margaret mitchell ' s book , this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape , mistrust , murder , and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from . the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film , and even carried through in the second book , and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character . in the novel , scarlett o ' hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family . after coming to an " arrangement " with rhett , she agrees to leave , and proceeds to reconnect with her o ' hara relatives in savannah . eventually , she accompanies her cousin colum , a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood , to ireland , to further explore her family ' s " roots that go deep , " and is eventually named " the o ' hara , " the head of the family . while her duties as the o ' hara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara , scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners , and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties . she , having been scorned by rhett time and time again , eventually agrees to marry luke , the earl of fenton , until rhett comes along in a clichÃ©d " night-on-white-horse " - type of a rescue . the " scarlett " miniseries fails even to do this justice . raped by her fiancÃ© and scorned by her family , the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed . 

i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision .  before i took a job as a reviewer , i never went to films like this , and thus remained blissfully unaware that at the soul of the hollywood film lies a deeply woman-hating spirit that thrives on putting its knocking little knees on the silver screen for all to either empathize with or revile . or is this just a particularly bad year ? an ugly trend ? 

here we have yet another seemingly sweet , innocent , beautiful woman turned lethal weapon . the kind that cautions us that beneath every pair of batting eyes and nesting instincts lies a wild-eyed beast guaranteed to make everyone ' s life within 50 miles a living hell . 

this month ' s specimen is jewel valentine ' s ( liv tyler ) , whose simple dreams include having her own little house , a backyard fountain , and a mondo home entertainment system . unfortunately , randy ( matt dillon , in his first film in 3 years ) , the dim-bulb bartender she picks up at mccool ' s one night intending to rob , is less materially oriented . the kind of guy who drinks beer out of a toilet plunger , he prefers to hunker down in his dead mother ' s house with few creature comforts save his snowglobe collection . 

in that same low-rent bar , the devil in the red dress also bumps into randy ' s cousin , carl ( the highly amusing paul reiser ) , a lawyer with an ego the size of st . louis . when things go south within hours , enter the widowed detective with a heart of gold ( john goodman ) . the result ? three men sustain big , bad crushes on the leopard-clad progeny of steven tyler and bebe buell-crushes that make them do things that common sense would normally contraindicate . like get involved in the first place . 

multiple points of view and flashbacks patch together the front-page news about how easy it is to fall victim to one ' s libido , especially if you ' re male . as each of these men relates his perspective to a confidant , his desire to possess the jewel colors the `truth ' of the situation . about 70 minutes later , things come together in a reasonably amusing way . but it ' s amusement from the same source that tells you that the stuff on the popcorn actually tastes like butter . 

mccool ' s is the first film by norwegian commercial and music-video director harald zwart , and his pedigree is clear during some of the fantasy segments , including one about a car wash , soap and a hose that you can probably extrapolate . it ' s also the debut project from the production company owned by michael douglas , who ' s found his niche as a toupeed sleezeball in a bingo parlor . 

dillon and tyler are unlikely to win any gold statues for this one , though given the one-dimensionality of their overdone film noir-type characters , you can ' t really fault them . several minor roles drag out unexpected guests--reba mcentire plays carl ' s psychiatrist , and andrew dice clay doubles as both the hoodlum utah and his even-scarier brother . ( finally , an outlet for all that aggression . ) 

this film unwittingly speaks volumes about the dynamics between men and women--or men and their mommies . but ultimately you ' d probably find more lasting psychological truths in a bugs bunny episode . i will say that it ' s better , funnier , more sophisticated than other recent gems like tomcats , but should we really have to choose what to see based on what ranks lowest on the misogynism scale ?  victor jory never became a major star . he is better known for later character roles than for his early leads . but he was very handsome and an excellent actor . 

his love scenes with loretta young in this romantic adventure thriller are passionate . their kisses look very real . and very modern . 

vivienne osborne is a standout here also . she plays a woman with a reputation . but the character has a good heart . 

the print i saw was not clear . but what a joy that rare movies like this are turning up ! and they are , in some sort of watchable condition , still intact . this is nothing truly special . but if one is willing to sift through movies of its era with similarly intriguing titles , one is likely to find some suprtb movies .  this film did well at the box office , and the producers of this mess thought the stars had such good chemistry in this that they cast them in the much darker screwball farce , the gazebo . frankly , i am shocked to see all the positive comments on this ludicrously plotted unfunny comedy . both lead characters have the maturity of seven-year-olds and are much less interesting to spend time with . a veteran supporting cast including fred clark , harry morgan , and eva gabor lend excellent support . and , the beautiful cinematography certainly makes the rich countryside of spain seem lush . and , there are four or five truly funny scenes to go with two wise scenes and a whole bunch of recycled and unfunny clutter . 

i cannot recommend it started with a kiss .   ( spoilers ahead ! ) this same exact plot from this movie has been done before . it has been done in ferris bueller ' s day off ! marques " bat man " houston plays sick . his gullible parents believe him . his sister knows that he ' s faking , but she still must go to school ! she is mad . he has a party with his friends while his parents are away . by the time his parents get home , he is sick again and his parents never found out about the party . i like immature better when they were in house party 3 and still immature !  is there anything else on earth to be more enticing than to learn what expects our frail bodies after , um , death . spanish director ignacio cerdÃ  ( a soul-mate of his german colleague jÃ¶rg buttgereit ) provides blow-by-blow answer to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey in the world of preparation tables , scalpels , surgical saws , human entrails and warped minds . 

welcome to the autopsy room ! 

i don ' t know which facets of the film , apart of its notorious reputation , may have helped it to acquire sufficiently high rating . 

storywise it ' s fairly simple and straightforward - a day in the life ( actually half an hour ) of a troubled coroner ( or , perhaps , assistant pathologist or whoever he is ) that is fed up with his routine morbid duty and discharges his psychological tension in a non-traditional fashion , right at his workplace . i ' m perplexed of what particular message the authors tried to deliver with this one-note plot . i suspect it may be somehow inspired by udo kier ' s character ' s quirky demeanor in andy warhol ' s frankenstein . 

artistic values of the film are also questionable . it ' s hard to evaluate the performance of the actors that don ' t squeeze a single word . their emotions are concealed behind the medical masks . there ' s also not enough room for great camera-work - basically , the entire action unfolds mostly within four walls . 

authenticity - effects and makeup are impressive and the setup looks very plausible , but only a handful of medical / forensic experts can judge how truthful and anatomically correct the dissection is carried out here ( if anyone cares ) . honestly , i used to think that the autopsy is done to examine the condition of particular organs and to ascertain the cause of death . now i know that dead bodies are severed , raped and humiliated , intestines are ripped apart , brains are retrieved from the head , stuffed into abdomen and mixed with guts , then the body is stitched back and washed - nothing personal . and what are these poor lads expected to write in their deceitful autopsy reports afterward ? 

shock and disgust factor - it ' s much unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer would discover , to his horror , that the disc he was intended to watch with his wife and kids beside a christmas tree turns out to be a graphic video manual on vivisection . this obscure item is barely available , sought by people well familiar with the subject and not easily offended . hence it would be pointless to warn anyone to sabotage this film . they are well aware what exactly they are watching and what they want to see . 

cerdÃ  is really gifted and stylish director , which is clearly obvious from at least two other parts of his " trilogy " - preceding ' the awakening ' , amazing black and white short , and 30-minute ' genesis ' , visually stunning and moody piece with an off-beat and interesting concept . and i ' m pretty sure that one day he will conquer the hearts of moviegoers with his new , more mainstream oriented , material . and sooner or later ' aftermath ' would become a rarity for the meticulous collectors of his " early " " warm-up " works . 

but in the meantime , i ' m afraid , it may be recommended strictly for medical students or specialists that study mental disorders and sexual deviations .  hip , distinguished doctor james coburn ( as peter carey ) arrives to accept a position as pathologist at a boston hospital . almost immediately , mr . coburn beds beautiful nutritionist jennifer o ' neill ( as georgia hightower ) . while sleeping with ms . o ' neill , coburn is awakened by an emergency involving a botched abortion - the fifteen-year-old who bleeds to death happens to be the daughter of the hospital ' s big donor , dan o ' herlihy ( as j . d . randall ) . coburn doesn ' t believe the man arrested , doctor pal james hong ( as david tao ) , committed the crime ; although , mr . hong admits to performing illegal abortions on the side . while trying to clear his friend , coburn wades through a thickening plot 

 * * * * the carey treatment ( 3 / 29 / 72 ) blake edwards ~ james coburn , jennifer o ' neill , michael blodgett , james hong watching showtime i got the impression that the producers got the idea to put robert deniro and eddie murphy just for the sake of having a film that co-starred the two of them . other than that i can ' t think of a reason to justify the film ' s existence . not that it isn ' t amusing in spots , it certainly is , but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat muted . 

the thing that really got me was eddie murphy ' s character . i can ' t seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job . when i was working person at new york state crime victims board i had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs , but i can ' t think of one who thought that this was just something i do until i get my career going in an area far afield . i mean , can you really see eddie murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real police academy , not the screen version , just to get a day job ? 

anyway deniro is your basic hard working detective who ' s on the trail of a major gun dealer . he ' s undercover and murphy is part of his backup . so what does the showboating murphy do , he calls a reality based tv series like cops to film the action . 

so deniro ' s bust gets blown sky high , but the producer of the show gets some good footage of murphy and deniro and decides on a new reality based television series . so these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working deniro ' s case with all the tv cameras around . 

eddie murphy ' s a funny guy , i loved him in beverly hills cop and in the doctor doolittle movies , but he ' s done better things than showtime and robert deniro certainly has . 

i guess murphy wanted a chance to work with deniro and deniro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film .  i ' ve read a lot of reviews on the imdb ( well , all five of the ones that have been written at the time that i ' m writing this ) and i ' m surprised at the amount of praise heaped upon the brideless groom , which is undoubtedly one of the lesser comedies performed by the stooges . i prefer the older ones where it was larry , curly and moe , although shemp gets credit for most of the funny scenes in sing a song of six pants , another stooges short which is only moderately amusing but far superior to brideless groom . indeed , there is a single slightly amusing scene in the film , the " don ' t-hit-a-lady " scene , which is barely amusing at all and is 15 minutes into the film . not very promising in a 17-minute comedy . 

shemp is a voice trainer whose uncle has passed away and left him an inheritance of $ 500 , 000 , provided he get married within 48 hours , which is short enough notice as it is , but by the time shemp learns about it he has only 7 hours left . this is a premise that had been done and redone before , but was not , i don ' t think , a massive clichÃ© at the time this film was made , as it is now . there are a series of gags throughout the film , none of which are even close to the level of comedy for which the three stooges are so widely known . it seems that the stooges have run into the same troubles that plagued so many of shirley temple ' s films Â there is too little reliance on content and too much reliance just on the fact that they ' re there . 

the standard characteristics of the stooges are here , moe is the mean one , whose meanness is certainly not used sparingly in this film , and the slapstick sound effects ( although with more exceptions than usual ) are fairly amusing , but are plugged into their standard slots in this film . the line " hold hands , you lovebirds " is immortal . the rest of the film is not . 

there is much talk among the other people who have reviewed this movie for this site about this being one of the best of the stooges shorts , that you won ' t find one weak moment , about how this is their best since the early 30s shorts . it ' s just not true . i can certainly understand a level of automatic respect for milestone classics and for the giants of early comedy , which the three stooges certainly are , but that respect is damaged when poorer films are praised more than they should be . the brideless groom deserves some respect because it is a stooges film , but for exactly the same reason , it should have been better . the three stooges were just better than this .  i really like ryan reynolds and hope davis and i actually had high hopes watching this last night on dvd . mainly as i try to avoid reviews until i watch something myself and form my own opinion big mistake ! my 2 / 10 is for the first segment which in fairness is actually quite decent and if they had made the movie about the characters in section 1 alone it may have risen above the 5 / 10 mark . once it moved into tv ' reality show ' territory it stank to high heaven . ryan reynolds captured the essence of an actor on the edge wonderfully but as a gay tv writer and famous games creator / devoted family man he was definitely less effective . from the blurb on the box i expected a flashback thriller along the lines of ' memento ' - unfortunately this is nowhere near that standard of movie .  the creators of this movie must have sat down one day and said " let ' s make fun of the russians and at the same time show people how advanced we ( americans ) are " . the movie portrays the russians as an inferior people who are unable to understand the brilliant ideas put forward by the americans . it is true that american campaigns are probably more professional and more based on expensive studies than campaigns in any other countries are . however , this movie goes to far and it exaggerates the differences between east and west . to me it looked like a propaganda movie made during the cold war .  updating of the clare booth luce play and the 1939 movie is a major disappointment . the cast of women is excellent , most of the individual scenes work but nothing hangs together . there is no connection from scene to scene almost as if the film was crafted in parts and then assembled in a vacuum . granted the story of a woman dealing with her husband ' s infidelity and how she is helped and hindered by her friends is a less shocking one now in an age when divorce is so common , but at the same time its just as timely as ever , i just wish they could have managed to connect all of the pieces together because as it stands now you really don ' t feel pulled along by the plot . wait for cable .  disappointing film with walter pidgeon as a hunter who goes to germany to assassinate hitler . when he is discovered , he is coerced into signing a document stating that he acted on orders from england . his refusal to sign the document brings us to the plot of the film . 

pidgeon is pursued back to england by the evil george sanders and his cohort , john carradine , who speaks little , but is again as always , the embodiment of wickedness personified . 

along the way of being pursued , pidgeon meets up with joan bennett , the latter displaying a wonderful cockney accent . 

the story gets bogged down somewhat as love develops between the two , but again as we approach world war 11 , realism becomes the object of the day . 

the near-ending scene in the cave between sanders and pidgeon is nicely realized but we know where that arrow is going to go to . 

very interesting that while pidgeon is fleeing nazi germany , he meets up again with a young roddy mcdowall , one of pidgeon ' s many co-stars that same year in the memorable " how green was my valley . " how green was " man hunt ? "  first , a warning . ' how to marry a millionaire ' comes prefaced by an apparently random five minute orchestral performance of ' street scene ' , a gershwin-lite piece treated with the full pomp and ceremony of , well , gershwin . sitting through it takes some patience . if you have the dvd , rest assured , you can skip forward . you won ' t miss anything . 

the film itself is one of the perpetual disappointments of 50 ' s hollywood , a movie so bolstered by major star-power , opulent mise-en-scene and perfect high-concept that failure seems inconceivable . the title alone is perfect . generation after generation , however , are forced to ask themselves - how is this so limp ? the script is an albatross about the production ' s neck , a dead , smelling thing that chokes everything and everyone before they can really spark to life . there are no comic situations , just isolated moments that play for laughs . whenever an actual comedy scene threatens to develop , the movie quickly moves on to other , less interesting things . a case in point - the scene where the three leading ladies each bring a date to the same fancy restaurant . one of them , short-sighted , refuses to wear her spectacles out of vanity . one of the dates is married . a classic hollywood farce set-up , surely , complete with mistaken identity , angry wife , and probably a pie in the face for somebody ? well , no . instead , we cut between the three dates as the ladies react ' comically ' to things their partners say . hit the punchline , and cut to the next limp joke . if in doubt , have marilyn walk into a wall . where ' s billy wilder when you need him ? 

the three stars are almost a perfect diagram of the life cycle of the classic hollywood screen goddess . this was one of marilyn monroe ' s breakout films , and the camera just eats her up , even though the script gives her nothing to do . she ' s so luminescent she almost seems newly hatched . lauren bacall , on the other hand , had been a major star for nearly a full decade , and she knows how to dominate the screen even when in frame with monroe . she gets the only thing passing for a real role , and delivers the few good lines with a cynical snap - given the right material , she could have brought this thing to life . she ' s a curiously ageless actress - when she lies about her age in the film and claims to be forty , it isn ' t instantly ridiculous - and far less girlish than her co-stars , giving her a convincing authority . betty grable was far from ageless , and had a good eight years on her co-stars , putting her near the end of her hollywood career . there ' s an air of desperation about her at times , stranded on screen with nothing but a toothpaste smile and a few scraps of comic timing , unable to play her real age but fooling no-one as a contemporary of this new , sharper generation of actresses , relying on the same old schtick that had served her throughout her career ( for marilyn-doubters , seeing the two juxtaposed in this movie helps to throw monroe ' s subtlety and - yes - intelligence into sharp relief ) . she ' s also lumbered with the dead wood in terms of male co-stars ( although all of the men - even the great william powell - are guilty of lazy performances ) ; she ' s unable to strike any comic sparks off them . better to have given her role to the under-utilised monroe , who could be funny all by herself , and left grable with the repetitive mr . magoo routine . 

that the movie is as enjoyable as it is can be put down to the luscious hollywood production , the sort that renders even the twee likes of ' by the light of the silvery moon ' watchable . but somewhere , buried beneath the flabby jokes and professionalism , lies the rough outline of a sharp , cynical comedy about the business of marriage that bacall could have made sing - and new generations of movie viewers will sit down with ' how to marry a millionaire ' in expectation of that movie , ready to be disappointed all over again .  rock hudson ' s second venture in the science fiction genre after seconds is embryo a film that combines elements of the bride of frankenstein and pygmalion in one rather weird film about for lack of a better word a test tube baby that grows up to be barbara carrera . 

hudson is scientist experimenting in organic development and gets a chance to first experiment on his own doberman pincher when it is accidentally hit by his car . 

some pituitary secretions from the female dog are given to a prematurely born puppy and it grows remarkably into an adult . exalted with his success , hudson takes a fetus from a dead accident victim and gives it some of the same stuff . 

what he gets is barbara carrera . and she develops physically and intellectually at a prodigious rate . what she doesn ' t do is develop emotionally . still hudson passes her off as his new research assistant to friends and family like sister-in-law diane ladd , son john elerick , and daughter-in-law anne schedeen . 

embryo doesn ' t explore some of the real issues in this kind of science , it exploits them instead . the special effects as they are , are pretty second rate . hudson looks like he lost interest in the project about halfway through the film . 

now what would have really been interesting is if he had gotten boy child and it grew up to be a harlequin novel hero . now that would have been something rock hudson could have sunk his teeth into .  according to the article at http : / / blog . ifeng . com / article / 2737487 . html , one of the actors in the film , carina lau , was forced to appear in this movie for free . she was the victim of an infamous kidnapping shortly before this movie was made , and later photos of her in distress were published in a magazine , which has since been forced to shut down and its publisher sent to jail . the actress denies she was assaulted but there was a movie leaked on net that allegedly showed her being gang-raped . ( the hong kong press , out of respect for her , has mostly refused to report on the incident , but google will turn up a few articles about it . )  i was waiting for this movie for a time . in the first day of the air in turkey , i watched it . it was totally a disappointment for me . i was planning to watch a historical movie , but the one in the screen was a fictional one . first of all , the main character of the movie cengiz han , the great conquer was portrayed like a soft , calm , even a loser one . you can not feel the power in the movie . historically , the war machine he created was conquered Â¾ ( even more ) of the world know in those years . to do that , cengiz first unite the asian tribes . however , in the movie , this loser man is in one scene poor-alone man , and in second scene , he is commanding armies . war scenes were incredibly week . in the final battle , the mongol horseman were using double swords on their sides and cutting the enemy . : ) as a consequences , me and my friends just laugh at that scenes . mongol army means mongol archery horseman . you can not see that in the movie . another ill thing was the use of fantastic elements in the movie . i do not want to go into the scenes which was portrayed cengiz as a prophet . we can say in the integrity of the movie , it is acceptable . however , the scenes when the old monk saw the future and go to find the wife of cengiz khan after cengiz gave him a mission is really funny . when the monk died in the desert , cengiz ' s wife feel this dead and she find the corpse in the continent . we are talking about the asia again we laughed . there are a lot of more things to say but , i don ' t feel that this movie has value to talk more .  star trek v definitely earns the dubious distinction of being the weakest film in the star trek series . despite the good acting efforts by the actors , it suffered from a general lack of funding from paramount pictures . paramount pictures was not enthusiastic about this film at its very onset . 

the movie begins with the enterprise crew enjoying their extended shore leave as a reword for saving the earth from total ecological disaster . their shore leave is cut short when a disturbance occurs on nimbus iii , the planet of intergalactic peace . captain kirk and the enterprise arrive at nimbus iii only to have their ship hijacked by sybok , spock ' s half-brother . sybok brainwashes the crew of the enterprise and sets it on a suicide mission to rendezvous with " god " just past the great barrier at the center of our galaxy . captain kirk must then figure out a way to regain control of his ship and to fend off the enterprise ' s klignon pursuers . 

the only bright spot in the film is the acting and directing . william shatner , leonard nimoy , deforest kelley , laurence luckinbill , and the rest of the cast all give good performances . william shatner also does a pretty good job directing this film . 

however , the film suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding . first , the part of sybok was initially offered to sean connery , but he refused . so , laurence luckinbill got the part . second , many of the special effects were severely cut back . . . reducing the movies entertaining potential . third , the scene that depicts the arrival at the great barrier left much to be desired . finally , the romance between scotty and uhura in this film did not make much sense at all . . . considering that no such romance ever occurred prior to this point in the star trek universe and it was never explained how such a romance could suddenly materialize between star treks iv and v . 

overall , this is a very weak film . you should probably just skip this film and move on to star trek vi . after all , the cast and crew made star trek vi partly to bail themselves out after their debacle with star trek v .  a desperate attempt to make a " film-noir " sci-fi thriller , but the movie falls short . it has no believable plot , some of the key actors were a joke ( not lars bom , he is cool ! ) . i did like the " access restriction by bandwith maximizing " though . i finished it on principle , but went home with the feeling of having lost two hours of my life . . .  the figure of empress elizabeth of austria ( 1837-1898 ) is , indeed , mostly associated with romy schneider and the sissi trilogy by ernst marischka ( 1950s ) where beauty , gentleness , sweetness but also history are ever present . this was the sissi , perhaps myth for some ; however , a powerful portrayal . the spirit of the habsburgs ' grandeur as well as the spirit of the bavarian simplicity and straightforwardness influenced much those films . simply , they did have a soul . however , jean daniel verhaeghe ' s film , though made 50 years later , appears to be a wrong depiction of the empress and her life . it seems to be an attempt to show something different , to reveal some realism as a cure to sweetness ; yet , it does not occur to add a lot but rather deprives the whole story of much . let me analyze that in more details . 

september 1898 , sissi embarks at the port of geneva . accompanied by her court maid , she goes to visit dr mayer ( didier bezace ) whom she is going to tell the whole life story in order to find herself in this tragic life . the action consists of flashbacks to important moments in sissi ' s life , yet these moments are chaotically presented and , therefore , someone not very knowledgeable of austrian history may get totally misled or confused . much attention is drawn on sissi ' s bad marriage with the emperor franz josef . the scene of her wedding night is a failure . no one treated an empress like that ( i mean undressing and payment ) . the focus on sissi being misunderstood is right historically , however , the points that her views differ from the rest of the courtiers ' are not the true ones . where is her desire for peace ? where is her love to her nation ? where is her charity ? sissi appears to be rather very elegant , modern , liberal ( from the 21st century ' s point of view ) . she foremost cares for her looks which is not true historically . sissi had an inner life which is not showed in the film . " once women will wear trousers " is a sentence said by her and occurs to be the image of the sissi presented in the movie . sissi detests monarchy , which is the film ' s noticeable criticism towards austrian empire . moreover , she partly accepts anarchist movements and , to my very surprise , she blames her husband , emperor franz josef , for the death of rudolph , their son . where is any mention in history that sissi was present in mayerling ? sissi ' s relation with sophie , the mother in law , is better shown , however the scene of sophie ' s death seems barely authentic and the conversation a bit of clichÃ© . 

sorry to criticize so much but another crucial aspect of the movie which i find weak here are performances . although arielle dombasle has her moments as sissi , she generally does not suit to the role . she looks more like a " femme fa tale " than a tragic empress . her make up is seriously inaccurate as well as most of her gestures as the empress . malik zidi is a bit better as rudolph and may be regarded as the one raising the value of the performances , in general . yet , stephane audran does no special job as sophie : you simply don ' t get the impression of why she detests sissi . she did despise her for the sake of sissi ' s young age while crowned , for the sake of her behavior , lifestyle and her believes . partly it appears in the movie but definitely that is not enough . but the greatest mistake is , i think , julien hans capua as andrassi . andrassi was a count with pride , honor , patriotism . . . here , he appears to be a sort of libertine thinking only to make love to his queen . and the portrayal is so weak that this performance is very very pale . the accurate choice is tatyana ivanova as catherine schratt , she really fits to the role with her looks and her gestures . but , unfortunately , her role does not require much time on screen . 

a good point of this movie are some costumes and pretty authentic locations . the port of geneva is well presented and the moment of sissi ' s death occurs to be a good surprise from the movie . it does not appear to be how it really was ; however , the moment is good from the symbolical perspective . . . the empress walks and knows nothing that this is her final moment . that is how she must have felt about it , that is how one insane man destroyed a part of greatness of the world . another good moment visually was when sissi talks to her son rudolph on corfu . but these moments are rare . 

in sum , it ' s not a good film . it distorts a very eminent historical figure , a significant historical time , it tries to cure the sweetness of sissi trilogy but appears to offer nothing creative . charm is gone , grandeur is gone and history is ignored ! not very worth seeking out ! 3 / 10 the story of farewell to the king is intriguing . an american " deserter " ( i had the impression he and his 3 comrades were only trying to escape capture in the philippines as their desperate escape by raft to borneo is not your classic desertion ) . but no sooner do they come ashore when they are discovered by the japanese . nolte ' s character ( a sergeant ) has only moments earlier walked down the beach alone and was not noticed . and incredibly , no one noticed his footprints in the sand which would have led the japanese right to him . but anyway , nolte is taken in by a tribe of headhunters and becomes their king after defeating another tribesman . so he ' s out of the war . then the british commandos show up and want the tribe to assist them in fighting the japanese . 

unfortunately , nolte ' s incessant hamming ruins an interesting story . instead of acting like a former soldier thrust back into the war , now with a tribe of warriors under his command , nolte acts like he was raised by the tribe . he speaks as if english is almost a foreign language , rarely using contractions . he makes sweeping gestures when he talks , and acts like he is one with nature , as if he was raised in the jungle . 

there is plenty of action and many interesting scenes with the british interacting with nolte and the tribe . but nolte ' s character is never believable . it always looks like he ' s overacting . he needed to be a little more of an american soldier and a lot less of a tribesman . as it is , he comes across , not as a regal king , but as a lunatic who has forgotten who he really is . but that is not the intent of the film , as the script has him being admired and trusted by the british commandos . there is never any suggestion that the british thought his behavior was strange . he is simply viewed by the british as the defacto leader of the tribe . thus , it always seems that nolte ' s character isn ' t fitting in with what ' s supposed to be happening in the film . 

another actor might have done a great job with the role , delivered his lines believably , and made it an outstanding movie . but nolte ruins the film by hamming up every scene and appearing to not understand what his character is supposed to be . 

what a waste .  having just finished reading the book " one of a kind " a week ago , i was thinking " this would make a great movie , especially now , when people know a little about poker and poker players " . i was totally shocked to find it while browsing at the video store last night . i had no idea someone had actually turned this into a film . i grabbed it immediately and watched with much anticipation . what a major letdown ! 

all of the intriguing things about stu ungar were skimmed over quickly , and instead i was left with a biopic that could have been about anybody . ungar may have been a burnt-out jerk , but he was also a brilliant thinker that could read people instinctively . that is what made him so fascinating . why not focus on that ? 

and talk about watering down the real truth . this guy was excessive about absolutely everything : drugs , women , gambling , starvation , sleep-deprivation . he gambled on sporting events from dusk to dawn , he would go missing for days while hanging out in crack dens , his body was perpetually emaciated , and yet , if he ever needed money , he could always beat just about anyone at will playing cards . now that ' s a story ! 

too much time spent on his childhood and personal relationships ( although his ties with " vincent " and his daughter were hardly touched on ) and hardly anything about his drugs use ( which was exorbitant ) , his insane gambling and his incredible card-playing abilities . 

probably too late now , but i hope someone remakes this film properly . i had no problem with imperioli . he is excellent . the script just left him with nothing interesting to say .  having enjoyed koyaanisqatsi and powaqatsi i was looking forward to this third part of the qatsi trilogy and seeing what direction it had taken . rarely has a film so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way . although it tries to represent " civilised warfare " in the form of sport , science , trade and other forms of competition , it lacks the global scope and even the coherently developed themes of its predecessors . war is chaos , but even wars have an aim in mind and this film had little structure and unclear goals . 

naqoyqatsi is flawed by being a chaotic melange of images that does little to develop its theme . on the plus side , it wisely avoided using some of the iconic images of last century ' s wars . 

naqoyqatsi is also so insular that several times i had to remind myself that i was not watching an advertisement promoting the american way of life . perhaps this insularity reflects the ongoing " war on terror " . when representing " sport as war " the prominent team logos ensured that the usa was depicted as the winner . hence it missed the opportunity to depict some of the many sports around the world and showing that humanity is united in its use of sport as a form of civilised warfare . 

apart from newsreel , the footage seemed to have been shot on a budget in the confines of new york and there was little recognition of " life as war " in the rest of the world . the gallery of faces ( waxworks ) gave only a nod to the existence of important personages outside of the usa . the makers missed the point that globalisation does not mean americanisation . 

the philip glass soundtrack sounded much like every other philip glass score i ' ve heard ( with the possible exception of koyaanisqatsi ) and at best can be described as " inoffensive " neither adding to , nor detracting from , the chaotic imagery .  i doubt whoever wrote this screenplay has ever actually read mansfield park . . . or if they have it was not very well . none of the characters are what they should be : fanny is lively and conscious of her mistreatment , while sir thomas , who treated her very well , seems to have accidentally fallen into aunt norris ' personality . additionally , a first person narrative by fanny is highly inappropriate to both the story and her character . fanny is not an entertaining heroine , and i would contend that she is not meant to be . additionally , in the movie version , fanny flirts shamelessly with edmund from the very beginning , when they have been raised as brother and sister ! austen ' s fanny would have shrank from flirtation of any sort , and the novel paints the fanny / edmund pairing as highly uncomfortable . . . as it should be . unlike some other jane austen novels ( p & p , emma ) , mansfield park does not rest on the strength of its female protagonist . it is a very different sort of novel than the others ; it is not meant to be a love story . i watched this movie because i have just now finished reading mansfield park , and i am absolutely horrified by what i see ; miss austen is rolling in her grave .  after seeing the movie , i feel the father and the mother are both reasonable person , although not perfect at all . on the contrary , i don ' t like the author , and his two sisters . 

is a person ' s journal an accurate portrait of herself ? no . most of time people only write problems in her journal because she want to solve the problem . so a journal is always a more negative side of a person . in this movie , the author judge his mother ' s life by her journal . not a wise choice . 

the author ' s elder sister is so ugly , external and internal . first , she said her father ' s second marriage is " not fair " for her mother . then , she said she doesn ' t love her mother . so , she don ' t love both father and mother . i doubt she love anybody in the world . her face is so ugly , just a reflection of her heart . through out the movie , i feel the author and his sisters are lack of love and respect to their parents . however , i feel the father are mother are very loving to their children , even the author try to portrait them as cold , deceitful person .  the director of this movie is a famous french tv presenter , patrick sebastien . he likes music and humor for rednecks , and his incredible movie is absolutely in his image . it ' s the story of a young retarded person , called " zep " ( sic ) . a night , he sees his sister ' s sm sexual relation , and decide to do the same thing : he rape the girl who he loves ! zep is placed in a asylum , and his unlucky girlfriend in a clinic . one man will find them . one man will reunite them . this man is a psychologist . this man looks like a hell ' s angel . this man is . . . patrick sebastien ! with an excessive use of clichÃ©s , we ' ll see how the absolute love can break all misunderstandings , and how a humanist doctor can force a victim to fall in love with her rapist . we ' ll also learn how using sandwiches in order to seduce a girl . not only patrick sebastien thinks that he can do better than one century of psychiatry , but he also impose us a silly left ideology ; with the character of the father ' s girlfriend , a boss , who want to take away the feeble of his girl . distressing . but it ' s very pleasant to laugh at zep ( mentally retarded persons are not funny , except in this movie . )  i have read several reviews that ask the question , " why was this film made " ? i myself found that question looming in my mind as the hour and twenty minute feature seemed to drag near the middle , only to give off the sensation that it was picking up steam at the end , when in actuality it was doing nothing of the sort . so , " why was this film made " ? i think that is a great question for those watching heftig og begeistret to ask themselves . this reviewer is proud of director knut erik jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope , brotherhood , and inspiration with this all male choir , but i do not think that jensen did enough to bring a gripping story to the table . let me pose this question to you , " do audience members need more in a documentary than just a straight forward story to maintain interest " ? my answer is yes , and this is where jensen failed . heftig og begeistret was a good documentary , but it was far from great . jensen did a horrible job with the story and dedication of the subjects . it was great to hear the songs , but over time , those songs seemed dull , overwhelming , and a bit precocious . from the opening scene where our men are singing their hearts out in a blinding snow , i knew that i was hooked , but as the film developed i lost interest . why ? jensen never took us , the audience members , to the next level . he kept the playing field level and ultimately hurt the overall tone of the film . was this a movie about the music or about the men in the choir ? the world may never know . 

again , i would like to state that jensen did a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely seen hard times and how they coped with that through music , but it was as if the all male choir were a bunch of the most boring men ever created . jensen gave us the music superbly , but it was the characters , the subjects , that i knew nothing about by the end of the film . in the mix we had a 97 year old man who still had his driver ' s license , we had a large man in a tub singing classic american songs , we had old men who were once heartthrobs in their youth , we had some tension between the youth of the choir and the veteran singers , and we even had an ex-drug addict that had only been clean for eleven years . did jensen develop these interesting stories at all ? nope , he left them on the table . it was obvious that these singers were willing to talk further about it ( see the political man who missed his political days ) , but jensen seemed to clear away from those heartfelt moments and head straight back into interesting places that he could have the choir sing . to me , the music was defined at the beginning of the film , i wanted to be introduced and hear the stories of these individual men . they were all captivating , yet jensen seemed to ignore them completely . 

by ignoring the major subjects of this documentary , jensen became unsuccessful in creating any sort of tension towards the end . without giving the ending away , i felt like jensen was coloring in the lines . instead of being bold outside the lines , he chose to create no moment of sympathy , emotion , nervousness , or sadness . jensen took our subjects from point a to point b to point c without asking us to become involved in any way shape or form . i can see how national sentiment had made this film into a huge success in norway , but for everyone else watching ( i . e . me ) more was necessarily needed . i wanted to feel for these guys . i wanted to know if they were going to do well as they traveled , or just find themselves loved in their own city . there was no story , mostly in part to no development of the subjects . when you watch modern documentaries ( oddly , this film was made in 2001 ) , you want it to play out similar to any hollywood feature film . you want suspense , realism , and drama , alas , with heftig og begeistret you get nothing of the sort . 

overall , i must ask the question again , " why was this film made " ? my final answer alex , is that jensen wanted to show how troubling times and a changing economy can still produce happiness in even the coldest places of earth . i think that jensen wanted to show human dedication and how something as simple as singing can unite a population . with that said , jensen demonstrated that perfectly in this film , but he did not create a good documentary . when you make a film of this nature , i feel that you must look within the group , examine the choir participants and hear each one of their stories to bring about an ending that will grip your heart . the only thing that this film gripped was my attention span as it attempted to leave the room at rocket speed . again , i do not want to sound negative about this film because the music was excellent and the men singing did bring about a feeling of honesty , but i needed more . with documentaries becoming a bigger staple of the film community , one expects a bit more than what heftig og begeistret handed to us . i want to see reality and people , not just another song and dance routine ! 

grade : * * out of * * * * *  like a lot of films from the early sounds days , cimarron must be viewed more for historical interest than as compelling entertainment . the hammy acting of lead richard dix , nominated for best actor , can be excused as a relic of the silent-film school of acting . however , even giving benefits of the doubt , cimarron is a badly shaped piece of drama -- a bloated film that moves from unrelated sequence to unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact . offically , the film is two hours and four minutes ; it feels like four hours when you ' re watching it . there is no reason to waste your time on it unless you want to see every best picture winner or have a keen interest in the early sound days . in my opinion , cimarron is the worst choice for best picture in academy history and the award should have gone to city lights or little ceasar . cimarron is barely remembered today , and would have be remembered at all if not for its oscar win .  this was a strange film . a bit horror and certainly film noir . some fifth columnists meet and mysteriously start dying off with a japanese dagger in their hands after monsieur colomb ( bela lugosi ) shows up . 

soon the lone ranger arrives in the person of fbi agent richard ' dick ' martin ( clayton moore ) . martin is ineffective in finding the killer as he is more interested in the niece ( joan barclay ) of a missing doctor , who is part of the gang . 

after the last man dies , and the doctor is horribly disfigured by some strange serum , the true story of the group comes out and that is where it gets interesting and weird . i won ' t spill it . 

lugosi was marvelous as the skulking killer .  i loved this movie when i was a teenager . loved it . it hasn ' t grown up with me , though . maybe that ' s because it ' s a melodramatic load of old rubbish , full of macho posturing , cheesy dialogue , overwrought slo-mo and characters saying ' goddammit ' a lot . the lumpy narrative blobs gracelessly from one character to another , one plot strand to another , without ever bringing it all together , and it doesn ' t help that william baldwin ' s mono-expression of a performance is wet enough to put out every fire in the movie ' s overlong runtime . robert deniro and donald sutherland are worth watching , but no one ' s really at the top of their game here , and the women folk get particularly short thrift . the only real impact comes from the impressive firefighting sequences , and hans zimmer ' s majestic score , which remains one of my all-time favourites .  this meandering tale of mob revenge is simply not very interesting , even with ed mcmahon in a ripe role as the chief heavy . jim brown kicks ass effectively , gloria hendry proves again that she can bring life to even the poorest roles , and brock peters is decent as the cop who plays by the book . it ' s still dull and badly constructed , and even the print shown on cable is now emasculated of its original james brown score .  with al jolson at the height of his popularity and warner brothers ' s the jazz singer having been the highest grossing film of 1927 , it was inevitable that the other studios would churn out a few vehicles for their own jolson-esquire characters . but while the jazz singer was a sensation for its being the first part-talkie , the matinÃ©e idol lacks the singing voice of its star ( the now obscure johnnie walker ) , and has to make do with just his visual antics . 

the matinÃ©e idol was an early directorial assignment for the renowned frank capra . capra ' s first couple of full-length features for harry langdon reveal a very showy , excessive style , which made langdon ' s already mediocre slapstick almost unwatchable . a couple of pictures later and capra has learnt to ease off a bit , with some fairly regular and decent camera-work . however he still shows no aptitude for shooting physical comedy . the longest comic routine - the stage performance - seems to have a few good gags , but it ' s all cut up into lots of different camera angles , and there is no chance for the comedy to flow naturally from the performances . theoretically , a good portion of the jokes are in the intertitles , but there are far too many of these and none of them is especially funny . 

of course , capra would eventually mature into a fine dramatic and romantic director , and you can see him beginning to develop in this respect . he cuts down the line , closing in on walker and bessie love in the scene where she first lays eyes on him in his don wilson get up , neatly establishing the wordless connection between them . then there is some beautiful and tender framing of the couple in their scene together at the masquerade , which is all very reminiscent of the love scenes in capra ' s early 30s output . 

johnnie walker , columbia ' s answer to al jolson , is not an exceptional talent . his comic timing is good but there is nothing to make him stand out . bessie love on the other hand is a pretty good actress too , with a very expressive face . kudos to her for getting involved with the physical comedy and losing her dignity with the boys . there ' s also a good role for lionel belmore , that rotund and jolly character actor who seems to turn up in absolutely everything in the late 20s and early 30s . 

the matinÃ©e idol is one of those pictures that has gained more than its fair share of attention thanks to its director later having made a handful of masterpieces . in and of itself it is a very uninteresting piece , and like most of capra ' s work before he met robert riskin , a disappointment .  take a few dark and stormy nights , fog coming in from the coast , obsession and doubt , two brothers who have a mysterious connection based on hatred , a suspicious disappearance , a shoe in the night silently grinding out a glowing cigarette butt , and , finally , a tremulous heroine who finds herself threatened as much by her own doubts as by one -- but which one ? -- of the men around her . sounds like we might have a good 80 minute noir . instead , under the direction of vincente minnelli and with two a-list leads , katharine hepburn and robert taylor , undercurrent becomes a nearly two-hour matinÃ©e melodrama , a long slog of threatening angst amidst the perfectly groomed , coifed and dressed cast . when you glance at your watch half-way through a movie and with a sinking heart see that you have another hour to go , both you and the movie probably have problems . 

minnelli , in one of his earliest non-musical movies , doesn ' t lay on the rococo hothouse approach as heavily as he later was known to do . still , what is basically a simple story of greed , murder and obsession is turned into an endless katharine hepburn vehicle . hepburn shows us in carefully lit close-ups how to demonstrate fear , love , anxiety , giddiness , happiness , doubt , suspicion and terror . robert taylor is more or less along for the ride . 

hepburn starts the movie as the tomboyish ann hamilton , an energetic young woman in slacks who helps her father with his inventions . their housekeeper is determined to get her married . when dr . hamilton decides to sell an important formula to alan garroway ( robert taylor ) , it ' s love at first sight . garroway is the smooth , handsome , dynamic inventor of the garroway distance controller , which was vital in the war , and which has turned him into a hard-charging millionaire manufacturer . he ' s a captain of industry , as one of his many washington friends says . ann hamilton , now ann garroway , may still be a bit of the tomboy , but her husband shows her how to dress and how to be a successful social hostess for all those congressmen and judges her husband knows . she learns fast and eagerly . they both are obviously and blissfully in love . 

but wait . the canker is about to gnaw . ann realizes she knows nothing about her husband ' s family . none of his employees or friends seem inclined to talk about them to her . when she learns bit by bit that alan ' s mother died in the old family home in middleburg while seated at the piano , or that he has a brother , michael , who has disappeared , alan becomes very quiet . . . and sometimes goes into a rage . he always apologizes . but wait once more . did his mother really play the piano ? didn ' t she really die in bed ? wasn ' t michael caught taking money from the family firm and alan sent him away ? all this plays out against the exquisite hotel suites , the manicured country home in middleburg with the horse stable and the tasteful ranch house by the sea . everyone in the movie except employees are dressed to the nines . there are exclusive cocktail parties and intimate dinners for twenty . even in a black- and-white movie , minnelli can ' t help but give us dining tables filled with crystal and china , tasteful and elegant furniture and lots of gowns . 

by the end of the movie , when all is finally known , when ann on horseback is chased along a high , extremely well-designed mountain trail by the bad guy on another horse , when she is threatened with death by boulder and her pursuer finally meets death by horse , it ' s a relief . even robert mitchum , who plays michael , is unable to bring much tension to the movie . what might have been in lesser hands a taut little b-movie , instead with the a list is just an overwrought melodrama , too big for its bones .  wow , this is anti-christian bias big-time ! this is based on a stephen king novel and he written this kind of bias before and then hollywood exaggerates it even more . in this film , we see a protestant minister and a catholic priest both act like fools and be profane at the same time . of course , the devil has taken over the town so maybe his influence is into these guys , too , but they are typical hollywood portrayals . they never show a minister who talks and acts like billy graham , or your local minister or priest . and - another " given " - they make the satan character the most interesting of the film . 

max von sydow plays the devil and makes him a likable guy . ironically , von sydow has played a number of these roles after portraying jesus in the 1964 film , " the greatest story ever told . " you wonder why actors are so screwed up ? they don ' t know if they are god , satan or anyone in between . 

ed harris , who played a lot of unlikeable roles up until the last few years , is appropriately cast in this story . he and the rest of the mean-spirited characters in this film do not make it fun to watch . 

from what i ' ve heard , king ' s book is even darker and more sick than this hate-filled movie but better constructed . frankly , who cares . king and hollywood deserve each other .  although this has to be the nadir of season six , this schmaltzy episode isn ' t badly written or acted . it ' s just that most of us looked to the x-files for taut , gripping horror / thrillers ending without easy answers and moving toward dark but fathomable conspiracies . season 6 gave us a stream of tongue-in-cheek comedies that undermined the show ' s continuity and , frankly , made simpsons ' halloween specials look like great thriller tv . 

in this episode victoria jackson of snl fame plays the long-suffering girlfriend of a man who sets himself up as a rainmaker . however her weatherman boss is the one who truly loves her and mulder winds up having to provide him dating advice in order to get out of town . 

there ' s some playful fun with the chemistry between the agents and some amusing but none-too-sophisticated characterization of midwestern hicks . it ' s nothing you ' d want to see more than once ! 

it ' s hard to figure out season 6 . x-files creator chris carter seems bored by the whole ' syndicate conspiracy ' story arc and abandons responsibility to the black comedy writers .  it is hard for a lover of the novel northanger abbey to sit through this bbc adaptation and to keep from throwing objects at the tv screen-in fact , if jane austen herself were to see this , she would be somewhat amused and possibly put out . maggie wadey ' s adaptation has made northanger abbey into what it satirized , the gothic novel ( and the readers of gothic novels ) . 

the role of catherine morland in the adaptation is portrayed fairly closely to austen ' s catherine , a open-hearted , generous girl whose imagination simply runs away with her . but the henry tilney of the novel is not a snuff-taking , cane-wielding , sappy-line-making hero of a gothic novel-he is a tease , a nearly-handsome man with a messy room and a living ( that ' s right , henry tilney is a clergyman , a charm that is completely dropped from the script ) . some of the best scenes from novel , when henry , completely deadpan , outrageously teases the literally-minded catherine on diction , journals , mrs . radcliffe , etc . , are not portrayed in the adaptation . a large section of henry ' s personality is lost when those scenes are not adapted . besides , peter firth ' s appearance is not accurate-henry tilney is supposed to be 24 or 25 , dark hair and a brown skin , not 35 or 40 and blond . 

there are so many other absurdities within the adaptation that invoke surprise and disgust-who is the marchioness , and what is she doing in the story ? ! why is john thorpe less of a dunce and more of a schemer ? why is northanger abbey a castle ? catherine of the novel , with her romantic visions , expects hidden passages and dark tapestries , but is very disappointed to discover that northanger abbey is actually a comfortable , modern house-another element of satire ! why portray general tilney as a drunk ? why does catherine have those strange visions of mrs . allen threading her finger , etc . ? catherine ' s imagination only runs away with her at northanger , with henry there to correct her gently . and lastly , why are so many facts concerning the tilney family and mrs . tilney ' s death altered unnecessarily ? to make the story more `horrible ? ' all of these oddities and more simply are too strange to be overlooked . 

 > a better film could have been made to portray the tragedy of bosnia . some parts are very effective and the film does well to give some idea of the suffering of the people specially the children , but overall it looks less like a film and more like a documentary . woody harrelson is very good but the rest of the cast has performed well without being extra ordinary . should be watched in order to get a rough idea of what the war did to the children of bosnia . if one expects a great and gripping movie , welcome . . . . . . will be a disappointment .  it ' s nice to see julie andrews trying a straight dramatic role here--something she hadn ' t done in awhile--but her character of judith ( wise they didn ' t try to pass her off as a ' judy ' ) has the old refined manners and tomboyish hairstyle of yore , and andrews enacts ' grown-up ' as any other actress would interpret frigid . it ' s a surprisingly bland drama set in barbados involving omar sharif ( not the liveliest leading man around--not even in 1974 ! ) hoping to make andrews a spy while also slowly leading her into the proverbial bedroom . unmemorable outing does have some camp value : the james bond-like credits at the beginning are a cheesy hoot . as for julie : she ' s quiet and contemplative , but that doesn ' t do much for the audience , or for the film . blake edwards paces the freakin ' thing like a funeral . * from * * * *  from the late teens to the 1920s , stan laurel was a solo act in films . during this time period , laurel was definitely not among the upper echelons of talent and his humor isn ' t nearly as good as contemporaries such as lloyd or keaton . however , for second-tier short comedies , he did create a decent niche . as far as the quality of the films go , they varied wildly . some , such as dr . pyckle and mr . pryde , were terrific , whereas most were of average to below average in quality . 

frozen hearts is an odd film . like many of the films he made for hal roach and distributed by pathÃ© during this period , the costumes were absolutely first-rate and the film looked very nice . however , despite this and having support from the likes of james finlayson , one thing they forgot to include in this film was humor . none of the jokes seem to work and the film looks almost like a drama , not a comedy . only the really silly intertitle cards betray the type film it ' s supposed to be . 

my advice is try to see all his laurel and hardy films and then see the solo films . in addition to dr . pyckle , try seeing the soilers and mud and sand--two of his more tolerable solo shorts .  a man comes to the office of the psychiatric dr . sammael ( joan severance ) claiming to be the demon asmodeus ( kane hodder ) , the torturer of the 13th level of the hell , and he would like to tell weird things . he tells that he had made a deal with lucifer to become human again . he should knock-up his virgin sister mary elizabeth ( alison brie ) on the day that their mother died and she should kill six people and deliver the anti-christ , and then he would escape from the pit and reborn . when mary elizabeth gets pregnant , her stressed and abusive sister catherine ( denise crosby ) does not believe that she is virgin , but their father and former obstetrician albert martino ( james callahan ) examines his daughter and sees her intact hymen . meanwhile the church discovers the truth about mary elizabeth ' s pregnancy and sends the priest and former military father anthony ( eddie velez ) to spy mary elizabeth . she is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver , lars ( jorg sirtl ) , who is the lover of her tenant and friend jennifer ( azalea davila ) , and jennifer herself and eat their hearts and drink their bloods , but she believes that she has nightmares . however during the ultrasound , she realizes that she is carrying a monster and she asks her father to stop her pregnancy . but it is too late . 

the awful " born " is a b-movie ( actually a z-movie ) that believes that is a great movie . the result is a pretentious and disappointing production , with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and terrible acting and direction . the plot is a complete mess : there is a priest that is a hit-man and former soldier ; a demon in existential crisis going to a psychiatric ; a father that examines the virginity of his daughter ; two female-demons ( succubus ? ) that stand naked like a statue with both hands covering their sexes ; a character that is a slut , and only exists to expose her beautiful body . there are many scenes with free and cheap nudity . but the worst is the acting : the unknown lead actress alison brie is histrionic , with ridiculous voices and grimaces . sorry , ms . alison brie , but i hated your annoying performance . i have not recognized joan severance , who has a good performance , since i still had the image of her youth . denise crosby performs a hateful character and like everybody , she got older but she is still a good actress . i believe that if the writer and the director had included some dark humor and assumed that this movie is a b-movie , the story might have worked better and better . my vote is three . 

title ( brazil ) : " o anti-cristo " ( " the anti-christ " )  starring : james belushi ; peter dinklage ; alex neuberger and jason lee underdog is a true hero ' s tale . here is the story of shoeshine , a regular , playful little beagle . when he is dog napped by a megalomaniac midget hell-bent on destruction , something freaky happens . 

our quirky little neighborhood pooch gains extraordinary powers . he can run as fast a cheetah ; fly as fast a superhero and has the power of thunder . he is no longer shoeshine ; he is underdog Â the best crime-fighter in the animal kingdom . the city cannot sleep until underdog rids it of the evil midget dr . simon barsinister and his cronies . 

if you fancy some really light-hearted entertainment with all the clichÃ©s of superhero action flicks , then this one is for you . as for quality entertainment , this one is strictly for the juniors . those of you hoping to enjoy the comedy of the fast-fading star -james belushi - a word of caution : this is not one of his finer works .  this film is worth seeing since it is a classic in the sense of being the very first full length film released in the process of three demention . it was not very good in its acting or story plot , but can be a great movie quiz question from an historical standpoint . it should be seen in the 3 d process with polarized lenses .  i hadn ' t seen this in many years . the acting was so good as i began this time , i thought , " great ! another movie i misjudged as a foolish young man . " but then the theme started to be clear and i felt the same way . 

this was hollywood , the seat of glamor ; so the concept shouldn ' t be a surprise . but it is so condescending a concept i feel as if i need to take a shower after watching it . in brief , it tells us that even physically ugly people can seem beautiful to each other and even feel attractive . 

dorothy mcguire is likable as the homely heroine . she seems to have been filmed wearing minimal make-up . robert young is injured in the war and feels scarred . his parents can ' t bear to look at him either . he seems to have all his faculties and in part , the notions of disability are outmoded . 

herbert marshall is on hand as a blind pianist . his character speaks is hushed tones and is omniscient . 

the best performance is given by mildred natwick as the owner of the title residence . she is bitter and dour but not made of ice . her story is much more interesting , and believable , than that of mcguire and young .  in 1967 i saw an outstanding musical at the wintergarden in new york city where angela lansbury lite the stage as mame . but did hollywood give her the lead ? ? ? ? no lucille ball great as lucy was given the role . she killed the film . what a mistake there was no chemistry as there was on the stage bea arthur and angela what a twosome when they sang . . it is too bad a producer does not put these two together even today for a film made in senegal , based , i guess loosely on carmen , the book , by prosper merimee , this film doesn ' t achieve a mere resemblance of the story that has been made famous as an opera and as other films . 

ms . gai as the karmen of the title is very good to look at . her fiery dancing smolders the screen , as is the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the film . 

this is a karmen that aims to please to all genders , but a real carmen , she is not ! 

we would like to see ms . gai in other films in which her talent is better used than here .   " electra glide in blue " is a slow moving b-flick in which blake plays a desert motorcycle cop who wants to be a homicide detective and becomes embroiled in a murder investigation . a mediocre film at best , " eg in b " features some members of the band chicago , a whiff of action , some philosophizing , and lots and lots of boring dramatic filler . not worth the time .  old ed was active back in the late 1950 ' s he was apprehended 16 november 1957 . the pr-24 police baton was invented in 1974 . yet the cops in the movie are all carrying the pr 24 . back then it would have been a standard " billy club " not the side handled pr 24 . sheeze , if you are gonna make movies do your research and get it right . also it makes no mention of ed ' s usage of the bodies . he tanned most of the skins and made various articles including a lampshade , a belt and several masks . he also had a large selection of " shrunken heads " that several local children knew about as he often babysat for them . he was found incompetent and committed to the central state hospital for the criminally insane .  the fact that a film is on dvd doesn ' t guarantee that its quality is very good . the fact that a film ' s quality is threadbare doesn ' t mean you shouldn ' t buy it . this review actually applies to 2 films paired on a single dvd . 

the plots of these films are of little consequence . they are of interest only to people who collect holmes films anybody who merely wants a few of the better offerings would do well to purchase some of those made by jeremy brett or , in a pinch , basil rathbone . there are a few other very good holmes films featuring good actors on a one-shot basis Â such as " seven per cent solution " or " private life of sherlock holmes " . in any event , these films are considerably less estimable . 

here we have a pair of films featuring some of the best actors to do holmes , even if the results tend toward disappointing . this appears to be the only disc with these films on it ( although " deadly necklace " ) appears by itself in the same version on other discs . 

 " ( sherlock holmes and ) the deadly necklace " dates from 1962 , although it neither looks it nor sounds it . some who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was produce by hammer studios . not that hammer hasn ' t turned out some really schlock stuff , but where christopher lee was concerned , they usually did a better job . the print a direct transfer from a rather worn 1 : 1 . 33 copy in black-and white . the quality of the color suggests the original may have been in color , and the snipped ends of the film ' s aspect suggest it may originally have been 1 : 1 . 66 or more . 

the film is set in the early 20th century Â not improbable , since holmes was still working then ( and didn ' t actually die until 1957 ) . however , the script is not adapted from any actual doyle story . it involves an egyptian necklace , and professor moriarty shows up as a world-famous archaeologist as well as the prince of crime . the plot is melodramatic and banal . 

the biggest defect of this film is that Â for whatever unfathomable reason Â hammer filmed it in germany . it was nonetheless filmed in english . it was then dubbed in german and then re-dubbed in english . so what you hear isn ' t lee nor any of the other original actors , but a bunch of unknowns Â not that , outside of lee , i doubt anyone would know any of the other actors . this is too bad , since lee ( see his " hound of the baskervilles " ) makes a quite decent holmes . as it is , his voice double is condescending and plain as bread pudding with no raisins nor cinnamon . 

the music for this film is primarily jazzy , in a possible attempt to be " period " . too bad nobody thought of ragtime . as it is , the music doesn ' t relate to what ' s happening on the screen , and often is at odds with the action . 

the other film is " ( sherlock holmes and ) the speckled band " from 1931 , starring a young raymond massey . the quality of the picture and sound is fully up to that of the 1962 effort , and in fact a bit better . massey makes a quite respectable holmes , although he certainly doesn ' t own the rÃ´le in the way rathbone did and brett does . the other thespians who take part in this production are unlikely to be of interest to modern readers . the acting Â as is true of many films of this period Â owes a lot to the post-victorian stage and to silent films . 

it should be noted that , while " the deadly necklace " is available on dvd by itself , " the speckled band " is available only with the former film . 

there is very little else to be said of this film . the settings seem to be an odd combination of the 1890s ( horse-drawn carriages ) and the 1920s ( electronic devices such as a primitive dictaphone ) . taken altogether , it ' s an interesting curio and a sufficient inducement to buy the dvd with the pairing rather than a dvd with " deadly necklace " only .  i really liked the idea of traveling between dimensions , and i even liked the wade / quinn tension in early episodes . some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extremely interesting backdrops for their stories . however , as the show went on there were more silly disputes among the friends and less of a true bond . there was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension . and every world had one of the characters falling in love . the writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top . too bad it would ' ve been nice to have a closely knit band of friends ( a la star wars ) traveling to different dimensions on tv for several years , rather than a tired band of knit pickers .  sorry folks , i love ray bolger ' s work but the one thing he ain ' t is a leading man . maybe if you pretend he ' s the last man on earth , this romantic plot might work but come ' on now ! 

here ' s a movie that exists simply to showcase the title song which was a big hit for the basie band the year before ( 1951 ) . and some pretty nifty singing and dancing save it from being a total disaster . 

however , the story line is pathetic , even by 1952 musical comedy standards . and the other songs are equally as forgettable as evening in paris cologne . the dialogue embarrasses the stars , day & bolger . only claude dauphin ' s boyeresque charms keep his character three dimensional . 

so , how to enjoy this movie on video ? 

a . ) fast forward through all the dialogue . . . 

b . ) surrender yourself to doris day ' s vocals and ray bolger ' s loose-limbed footwork . and don ' t miss dauphin ' s hilarious take on a rain-soaked , windswept reprise of " april in paris " . . . 

c . ) finally , keep a couple of bottles of cabernet chilled and handy . 

bob raymond the box is a film with great potential , but the makers totally misused that potential . the film seemed to take for ever , because of the boring family dinners and scenes about school and job-dialogs between the action . those scenes could and must be deleted in my opinion to keep up the tensity and thrill . the philosophy of human free will has potential and seems to referring to the philosophy of thomas hobbes ( 1588-1679 ) , but we find ourselves regretfully struck with magic and nosebleeds , were even harry potter would flunked his class with ! 

probably the best part was that moment when norma lewis ( cameron diaz ) has been shot to death , by her loving and caring husband as an act of human free will . i wonder how hobbes would react if he could . . .  the opening credits are pure poetry and i have watched it several times . it had a corny 20 ' s adventure feel to it . of course kathy is gorgeous , but that voice ! did she realize this was a talkie . one word--voice coach . great film for chronic insomnia ( along with a bottle of scotch ) .  korine ' s established himself , by now , as a talented and impressive image-maker . the promotional posters for mister lonely all include the film ' s most impressive compositions ( though there ' s one in particular i ' ve yet to see in promo material : that of a blue-clad nun teasing a dog with a stick , surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pouring down ) . the opening images of this film , of michael jackson lookalike ( diego luna ) riding a small motorbike round a track , is strangely compelling and beautiful : roy orbison ' s " mister lonely " plays on the soundtrack , and the images unfold in slow-motion . there ' s also a funny and terrific sequence in which the same character mimes a dance , without music ( though a radio sits like a silent dog next to him ) , in the middle of a paris street ; korine splices in sound effects and jump-cuts that evoke both a feeling of futility and dogged liberation in the character ' s dance routine . 

the first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely poignant ; father umbrillo ( werner herzog ) is an autocratic priest about to fly with some nuns over , and drop food into , impoverished areas nearby . in a scene that is both light-hearted and affecting , herzog must deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wishes to make the plane trip with them in order to see his wife in san francisco . as the exchange develops , herzog draws out of the man a confession : he has sinned , and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife having left him in the first place . this scene , short and sweet , gains particular weight after one learns its improvised origins : the sinner is played by a non-actor who was on set when korine and co . were filming - and his adulterous ways had given him , in real life , a lasting , overwhelming guilt . 

henceforth , the film is hit-and-miss ; a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that add to a frivolous , muddled narrative . whereas gummo and julien donkey-boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight via coherent structural frameworks , mister lonely feels like a victim of editing room ruthlessness . a few scenes were cut from the film , which would have otherwise painted fuller pictures of certain characters , due to continuity errors in costume - a result , no doubt , due to the absence of a shooting script and korine ' s tendency for improvisation . one deleted scene in particular - in which ' charlie chaplin ' ( denis lavant ) and ' madonna ' ( melita morgan ) have sex - would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later on in the film ( i won ' t spoil it , but it ' s there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration , and , as it is , only half-succeeds ) . 

the two strands of the narrative , unconnected literally , are best approached as two entirely different stories with the same allegorical meaning ; one compliments the other and vice versa . ( it ' s something to do with the conflict between one ' s ambitions and the reality of the current situation . ) but there ' s not enough of the herzog scenes to merit their place in the film , and so any connection between these two allegorically-connected threads is inevitably strained - and the inclusion is , in retrospect , tedious . 

this is an ambitious step forward from julien donkey-boy that suffers mostly , at least in the lookalike segments , from having far too many characters for the film ' s running length , a flaw that would have been even worse had big star names played everyone ( as was originally planned ) . 

with many of the imagery ' s self-contained beauty , and moments of real , genuine connection with the soundtrack , this feels like it ' d be much more suited to an art installation or photo exhibition . as an exploration of mimesis and the nature of impersonation , it ' d lose none of its power - indeed , for me , it would perhaps be more impressive . the loneliness attached to iconic performativity ( such as that encountered by both the icons themselves and those who aspire to be like them ) is well-captured in images such as that wherein ' marilyn monroe ' ( a gorgeous samantha morton ) seduces the camera with a seven year itch pose in the middle of a forest , or when ' sammy davis , jr . ' ( jason pennycooke ) settles , post-dance rehearsal , with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible , tranquil lake . 

as it is , moments like these , and all those where the titles of randomly-chosen michael jackson songs crawl across the scene , are married to one another in a film narrative far less affecting than it should be . 

 ( for those who see it , i lost all faith during the egg-singing scene , late on . you ' ll know which scene i mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb , as some sort of gimmicky attempt at the new cinematic language for which korine has previously been hailed . )  somehow , this documentary about miles manages to include very little music and no complete tunes . though miles appears in the film , 95 % of the interviews are other folks , not miles . there are huge chronological gaps , many aspects of his life ( his childhood prodigy , his drug addiction ) are skipped or glossed over , and you ' ll learn little about what made the man and his contribution to music so groundbreaking . skip it .  i have to admit that in spite of all media promotion and being nominee for oscar , my expectation from the film was not so high before watching it . and i really found what i expected ; a film trying to be likable for both for conservatives and liberals in turkey , trying being authentic for foreign spectators and enough funny for all . but it should be understood that it is not possible to be favorable for everybody , therefore film stays as average for all . 

whole movie is telling a story occurred within 24 hours . to fit the short story in a full movie length , some scenes are added without a connection with the main story . these are mostly the ice-cream selling scenes to the eccentric local people ( i . e . goat herdsman , old women etc . ) , and each of these selling scenes are tried to be interesting to the spectators by skits with comic dialogs . the subject is mentioned as a universal problem : struggle of a local producer-tradesman against holding companies and monopoly , but this was the interesting subject of twenty years before . most of the readers will remember the " hero grocer against supermarket " from ferhan sensoy in 1980 ' s . this was the correct story at correct time . shortly the story is not strong enough and worth to be a movie as by now . 

except some gibbers due to local accent , the performance of cast is so successful . the leading role is played by turan ozdemir with excessive body language but anyway he is successful too . 

on the other hand against limited budget , appreciable efforts of director and players are obviously giving a good mood to the film . but this is not resulting a film well enough either to compare with italian neo-realists or worth to be oscar nominee . 

note : in the real life , normally the ice-cream seller would stop his own production and be the dealer of one of the competitors of manda brand .   ' carolina moon ' is an adequate made-for-tv movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the town where

she grew up in and where her childhood best friend was murdered . turns out that every year on the same date another

young girl is murdered and tori , played by claire forlani , must solve the mystery before she ends up dead . claire forlani ( meet joe black , csi new york ) is the female lead and does a pretty good job of it , ably supported by the rather delicious oliver hudsom and a still luminous jacqueline bisset . the script , adapted from a nora roberts novel , is bog-standard and the plot

is tediously predictable . that , however , is offset again by , like i said , the rather delicious oliver hudson .  soultaker was written by and starred vivian schilling . it also starred joe estevez , gregg thomsen , and robert d ' zar as the angel of death . 

the story begins with introduction to soultaker , played by joe estevez . we quickly learn what soultaker ' s role will be in this movie . 

next the college aged young people are getting ready for a summer festival , aptly named " summerfest " . in this film , the battle of the classes is omni-present throughout the film . the girls come from a wealthy class , and the guys come from roughly middle or lower class . the class roles seem to play a role in the film for some reason which isn ' t really clear or pertinent to the story . 

at summerfest we learn more about the apparent class struggles of why zach isn ' t encouraged to date natalie . soultaker makes an appearance as well , with apparently his boss the angel of death . here d ' zar ' s character points out who is to die and who ' s souls are to be taken . it ' s revealed as well , that soultaker will have a character conflict regarding natalie , and how he deals with her because of someone in his past . 

meanwhile natalie is ditched by her ride to summerfest , and zach convinces her to ride home with them . during the ride home , soultaker takes an active role causing them to wreck horribly at high speeds . 

the rest of the story surrounds the soultaker collecting the souls of the dead passengers , and zach and natalie trying to outwit him to return to their bodies so they can continue to live . the class and character conflicts lay in the story , but are really never brought to the forefront or resolved . 

there ' s an attempt towards the end to drag out some of the drama , there ' s a lot of chasing and running which does tend to be really boring . it ' s not really acceptable , and it would ' ve been nice had this been dealt with differently , somehow to maybe increase the drama but not bore the audience . 

the story and acting are decent . the soundtrack is ok , and even the production values are good . 

robert d ' zar in his brief on screen appearances does a nice job as the angel of death . joe estevez does ok , however sometimes his role acting a bit flat . vivian is pretty and does a decent job as natalie , although perhaps over acting a bit in a few scenes . 

this may sound odd , but this movie definitely could ' ve benefited from some pointless nudity . vivian teases us a bit but that wasn ' t enough . 

in my opinion this was a pretty serious attempt at making a movie . the results , it ' s worth watching . just don ' t expect a perfect production . 

3 / 10 robert montgomery-myrna loy farce about loy ( irene ) and her fiancÃ© , played by reginald owen , stranded in labrador when their plane crashes . ( that ' s really what should have happened to this highly predictable film . ) montgomery lives there while he is waiting for his fiancÃ© . 

surprise ! montgomery and loy are soon attracted to each other . the scene with the bear is so contrived . we knew it was a tamed bear all along . 

complications ensue when clara shows up . loy wants montgomery to tell clara that they should part ways , when he refuses , she wants to leave at once . 

you don ' t have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how this will end . out with all that snow , it ' s just too cold for anyone !   ' this life ' is truly as bad as it gets . its cast of mercenary , lascivious , ruthless , duplicitous , shallow characters are intended as a reflection on its post-eighties setting and i have to admit in this regard it is an accurate creation . unfortunately , it leaves me nothing to sympathise with or care about and i regard it as just another step toward the television premium-rate phone in scams ; astonishingly bad , cheap , reality and ' celebrity ' saturated television ; and other cut and run attitudes that have destroyed this medium and , indeed , much of british society . sounds exaggerated ? i don ' t think it is . in this regard programs such as ' this life ' have indeed been as influential as they are often called .  this movie is a window on the world of britain in 1973 - a world of holiday camps , fags and birds . i was actually at pontins prestatyn while this was being filmed , so it ' s fascinating to see where i holidayed as a kid , and what a world we have left behind . the ' plot ' , such as it is , concerns stan and jack ' s attempts to turn a job at a holiday camp ( 25 quid a week ! ) into an opportunity for chasing young women and winding up blakey . they are joined by the rest of stan ' s family and some laughs are to be had from arthur ( michael robbins ) and olive ' s ( anna karen ) persistent chuntering , as well as the sheer oddness of blakey , but the idea that young women would see anything desirable in brilliantined stan ( reg varney ) or lecherous jack ( bob grant ) is just risible . harmless enough in its time , now it ' s just a curio from a bygone age .  in 1913 , in carlton mine , addytown , pennsylvania , the cruel owner of a mine uses poor children in the exploration and after an explosion , a group of children is buried alive . on the present days , karen tunny ( lori heuring ) has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal disease when the family savings have been spent in the treatment . without any money , she moves with her daughters sarah ( scout taylor-compton ) and emma ( chloe moretz ) to an old house in the mountains that belonged to her husband . karen is advised by her neighbors to stay at home in the night , and sarah hears that there are zombies in the area . when emma becomes friend of mary , he mother believes she is an imaginary friend . however , when sarah ' s friends are attacked and eaten alive by zombie children and emma vanishes , karen and sarah chase her nearby the mine . 

 " wicked little things " is not a totally bad movie : the acting is good ; the make-up is creepy ; and the cinematography and the music score are excellent . however , the story , and consequently the screenplay , are very weak , indeed a bad collection of clichÃ©s . the beginning is reasonable , with a widow moving to a house in a remote location because the family spent all their resources with the illness of the patriarch . but when she arrives , coincidently the little zombies attack people without any consequences , for example , families do not search the missing persons . then the wicked mr . carlton comes to the place with the most disgusting attitudes , a typical clichÃ©s that he will die in the end . there is no explanation why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing mr . carlton . when sarah is running away with her mother and says that she is tired and cannot run anymore , it is one the most stupid lines that i have ever seen in a horror movie . my vote is four . 

title ( brazil ) : " zombies "  johnnie ( bert wheeler ) is a would-be songwriter ; newton ( robert woolsey ) is a would-be inventor . both work at a cigar stand in the lobby of an office building . johnnie wants to sell a song to winfield lake , a song publisher who also owns the building . lake ' s secretary , mary ( betty grable ) , is johnnie ' s sweetheart . when lake turns up dead , circumstances conspire to make mary and newton think that johnnie is the killer . they conspire again to implicate mary , who goes to jail . but who really shot lake ? who is the black widow , the blackmailer who had threatened him ? the other characters in this wacky murder mystery are : lake ' s suspicious wife , a self-satisfied private detective , a seemingly slow-witted janitor ( willie best ) , lake ' s auditor , a songwriter who thinks lake is stealing from him and another who thinks everyone is stealing from him . it ' s up to newton and his truth machine to reveal the real killer . 

the baby-voiced wheeler and the cigar-chomping woolsey strike me as an arbitrary pairing , but they made several movies together in the 30s and some of them were funny . 

not this one . george stevens , who went on to have a distinguished career , directed this dismal comedy with a tedious murder mystery plot . but two scenes are good , and both feature wheeler and betty grable singing the excellent " music in my heart , " written by dorothy fields and jimmy mchugh . the first time , they sing it walking up a staircase ( after which they dance back down ) . later , wheeler and woolsey are on stilts so that they can see and talk to mary , who is in a jail cell on a high floor . wheeler and grable sing to each other through the bars . 

 " the nitwits " has a few laughs , but the level of comedy is best illustrated by woolsey ' s line : " sonny , you ' ve got the brain of a six-year-old boy . and i ' ll bet even he was glad to get rid of it . " it ' s watered-down grouchoÂwho didn ' t use the superfluous " even " when he said it .  it is a movie which sheds the light on the begging of the palestinian struggle against the israeli occupation of palestine but it does not show the real feelings of the people back then and how they were tricked into believing that they could return to their home soon , it does not mention the massacres committed by the jews like der yassine and how they tortured and killed and destroyed the family of any palestinian freedom fighter it lacks the credibility about the real palestinian struggle and about anything palestinian , however it has something about the suffering of palestinian citizens ending up as refugees in the nearby arab countries , the movie focuses on the story of the man in coma he is now in the present time and through his story we see the film . the movie is just telling the life of one person and has some nudity scenes which are irrelevant to the story .  luchino visconti , the artist with the sword . courage should be the first word associated with his entire opus . film . theater . music . revolutions , artistic , cultural , personal . a legacy with powerful consequences and endless ramifications . he introduced the neorealism through the work of an american novelist james cain in " ossesione " he gave anna magnani the most extraordinarily beautiful close ups of her career . he gave us alain delon and maria callas . but the last word about his life and work rests on the talents of a certain adam low and the voice of helmut berger . what a terrible fate . 

for those interested , there is a 61 minute documentary by director carlo lizzani ( a man who really knew visconti ) titled luchino visconti a portrait . it is out on dvd distributed by image entertainment when a bbc murder thriller is this rife with heterosexual dysfunction , you know who the killer must be : the homosexual . 

who murdered the sexy blonde teenager ( who ' s also a pathological liar ) on her way home from school ? let ' s see , could it be the mother who ( against all common sense ) is letting her teenaged son make unchaperoned visits to his serial-killer father behind bars ? could it be the moody son , who ' s impressed by his dad ' s no-nonsense attitude about women ? could it be the serial killer himself , who seems able to manipulate events from behind bars , a la hannibal lecter ? could it be mom ' s boyfriend , a teacher at the school whose affair with an ex-student led to his wife ' s suicide ? or could it be boyfriend ' s daughter , who goes blabbing everyone ' s secrets at school , causing untold misery ? no , it ' s none of these likely suspects . it ' s . . . the homosexual ! 

the only mystery for the viewer is guessing who the homosexual is . of course , it could be anybody , since the only characteristics of the homosexual are shameful secrecy and a propensity to murder and otherwise make life complicated for the " normal " folks . the homosexual is the invisible root cause of society ' s ills ; only when this person is exposed and eliminated can the fractured family come back together , and things can return to normal . . . whatever that is . 

as for the cast , both jemma redgrave and robson green are now officially past their sell-by dates . the world could get by marvelously without ever seeing either on screen again , but as long as the bbc has roles for the aggrieved woman and the misunderstood man , i suppose they ' ll keep coming back in movies like this one .  if you pack all the clichÃ©s about city firefighters into 105 minutes ; you have ladder 49 . 

it has a story but is highly clouded by all the clichÃ©s . it turns it into movie that with every event ; becomes so predictable it ' s not worth watching . there is no depth to the story and even the acting seems superficial . 

it looked like it wanted to be a tribute to firefighters but ended up being boring and pretentious . the parallel between jack morrison being fatally trapped beneath an inaccessible part of a building and firefighters being trapped beneath the rubble of the twin towers was all too obvious . 

it doesn ' t compare to movies like backdraft and certainly does not set an example for future movies about fire personnel .  quintet marks the only venture of both paul newman and director robert altman into the realm of science fiction . it was said of newman that he could not do comedy , but he tried until he finally scored a real success in that genre with slap shot . but the failure of this film left him gun shy and he never tried it again . 

this is one of the biggest downer films i ' ve ever seen . it ' s a futuristic ice age , brought on by who knows what , but presumably it ' s a nuclear winter . even during the ice age of thousands of years ago , the equatorial parts of the earth still sustained animal and human life , but apparently not here . seals have survived and paul newman is a seal hunter on the outside . 

but hunters do need a little r & r and newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring the natives have some kind of game played with six people and it ' s a kind of russian roulette . to win you have to kill five other participants in your game . 

it ' s a sad turn to see what man has come down to . which is one of the reasons i just could not get into this story . the atmosphere is bleak , the story is bleak , the people are bleak , it ' s all so bleak . no wonder this thing came up short at the box office . 

it ' s a film that just about everyone thinks is never going to be on the top ten list of paul newman films , including me . 

this is man ' s future , what a bummer .  i walk out of very few movie screenings and this movie managed to become one of those that i couldn ' t bear to watch any longer . as far as the awards it won goes , the ones awarded by turkish festivals are not credible in my opinion . my only explanation for the queens festival award was to think that somehow a layer of comedy was " gained in translation " as the subtitles helped distract attention from the horrendous performances . 

at the beginning of the screening i attended , the presenter briefly talked about the history of turkish cinema and at one point mentioned that early turkish cinema was appropriately named " stage cinema " since many of the filmmakers and actors involved were people from the theater scene . 

ironically , this movie falls right into that category . english speakers reading subtitles may think that turkish is a naturally loud language and attribute all the yelling in the movie to that , but observant native commentators will immediately notice that all the actors are performing with exaggerated loud voices . you could attribute this to the amateur nature of all actors , but the biggest source of " yelled-out-dialog " is the main character , played by the only professional actor in the movie . not surprisingly his background is in theater . my guess is that in response to his loud delivery of lines , all other amateur actors raised their voices as well , hence turning the whole movie into a series of unnatural performances . 

put on top of all of this a storyline that develops at a snail ' s pace , you get an extremely boring movie . 

i have to say i also have a personal problem with turkish movies that depict entirely rural life with shallow uneducated characters . ever since " zugurt aga " , one of the best turkish movies ever made , turkish filmmakers seem to be not able to avoid the appeal of the rural part of the country . this is only interesting in small doses and if it is as beautifully orchestrated with excellent writing and directing as in zugurt aga . most often , however , it is extremely boring and frankly somewhat embarrassing to native " urban " turks . rural communities make up a neglected , undereducated part of the country , and while this provides good material for comedy , it comes at a huge cost to turkey ' s image . 

a western audience member whose only exposure to turkey is this movie will undoubtedly think that turkey is like afghanistan . i wish filmmakers would realize this and let go of their passion for the stories of the " rural man " and stay loyal to the majority of the country , who live in cities that put metropolitan areas in europe to shame .  it is a shame that a movie with such a good cinematography as this one had no plot to be supported by the work of sarah cawley ( cinematography ) and adam lichtenstein ( film editing ) , and above all , no sense of what goes on in mexico city . the movie tries to be a very realistic depiction of life in city , but it is unable to do it . it is a shame , a lot of film wasted . an american woman tries to find her brother who has been kidnaped . the first account of the story is powerful and interesting , very realistic , but it seems that there was no effort to come with a better narrative of the ordeal , especially when it comes to the issue of the attitudes of the us embassy personnel in mexico city , when dealing with an issue like this one . compare , as an example , with frantic ( 1988 ) , which deals with a similar issue . something similar can be said of the role of local authorities . compare , as an example , with todo el poder ( 1999 ) . the movie is worth watching if you want to get a sense of the looks of the city itself , paying little or no attention to the rather weak " plot " and the many twists that require a rather extensive suspension of disbelief . who is going to believe that a mexican patrol from mexico city is going to go all the way to catch the main characters to the mexico-us border ? and that this policeman is going to be able to use its radio from the border to mexico city ! only the producers of this movie . it is worth mentioning that unlike frida and other movies about mexico at least in these one mexicans talk spanish .  1st watched 1 / 1 / 2003 - 3 out of 10 ( dir-henri verneuil ) : sober drama about a well-to-do doctor who gets into trouble carrying on a relationship with a younger woman , whom his family brings in to live with them , as well as being married to another in the same household . his searching for happiness is not clear , but they do bring out the reason for his unhappiness rather well by displaying the overbearing trait of the females in his wife ' s line . well played , but predictable drama .  all through his career hitchcock did great films ; this was not one of them . 

a man knows too much , his daughter is kidnapped to secure his silence , and in the denouement all is resolved to the accompaniment of gunfire and rooftop drama . 

anyone who has seen 1930s fritz lang films- ' m ' comes to mind- will know how far this urban narrative of crime and conscience falls short of what had already been done in that genre at that time . there is an altogether amateurish air about much of the staging and acting which subverts any sense of menace , darkness , and depravity that hitchcock might have been seeking to instil . 

what it is worth watching out for , however , is the sequence associated with the shooting at the albert hall . once that kicks off it is as if the film has been given a blood transfusion . the camerawork is lively , the cuts are interesting , and the way that everything combines to a climax is masterly . here you can see the future master : hitchcock effortlessly orchestrate all the resources to impressive and memorable effect : when the scream comes you really feel as well as hear it .  army private gene kelly , who ' s also a talented trapeze aerialist , comes under fire for doing daring stunts without a net and alienating his high-wire cohorts ; meanwhile , there ' s an elaborate ' camp show ' to put on for army soldiers and personnel , and the whole studio of m-g-m has shown up to join in the fun . mickey rooney plays m . c . ( unctuously ) , introducing acts like kay kyser and his orchestra , bob crosby , benny carter , and the m-g-m dancing girls ( who appear to be dressed as vegetables ) . red skelton does a cute bit with donna reed and margaret o ' brien , but the other comedic bits suffer from an apparent vacuum between the performers and the allegedly-live audience ( they ' re awfully silent until the editor cuts to them for exaggerated reaction shots ) . judy garland sings an inappropriate song about a jumpin ' night at carnegie hall ( improbably accompanied by classical pianist josÃ© iturbi , whom judy calls ' hep ' ) . the production is glossy , but the manic energy feels false , fabricated . * * from * * * *  mickey rourke hunts diane lane in elmore leonard ' s killshot it is not like mickey rourke ever really disappeared . he has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene . he was memorable in : domino , sin city , man on fire , once upon a time in mexico , and get carter . but in his powerful dramatic performance in the wrestler ( 2008 ) , we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in get carter . whenever we get to know him , rourke remains a cool , but sleazy , muscle bound slim ball . 

this is an elmore leonard story , and production . leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller 3 : 10 to yuma , be cool , jackie brown , get shorty , 52 pick-up , and joe kidd . this means that we get tough guys , some good , some not so good . 

it also means we get tight , realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation , weaving complications into violent conclusions . killshot is no different . tough , slim ball killer rourke stalks unhappily married witness lane . think history of violence meets no country for old men . it is not as intense , bloody or gory as those two , but it is almost as good . if you like those two , including david croneberg ' s equally wonderful eastern promises , you will like killshot also . 

director john madden has not done a lot of movies . his last few were enjoyable , if not successful : proof , captain corelli ' s mandolin and shakespeare in love . 

diana lane hasn ' t had a powerful movie role since she and richard gere gave incredible performances in unfaithful . lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as nights in rodanthe , must love dogs , and under the tuscan sun . here she is right on mark , balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension . 

this is a small part for rosario dawson . yet dawson does a good job with it . you see a lot more of lane , including an underwear scene to rival sigourney weaver in aliens and nicole kidman in eyes wide shut . 

while you are in the crime drama section , also pick up kiss , kiss , bang , bang , and gone baby gone , and before the devil knows your dead . the last has wonderful performances by phillip seymour hoffman , ethan hawke , marisa tomei and albert finney . 

killshot flopped at the box office . more is our luck . it is certainly worth a 3-4 dollar rental , if you like this genre . 6 / 20 / 2009 the topics presented are very interesting ; suburban culture , suburban sprawl , public transportation , oil & gas depletion , energy dependence , alternative energy sources , etc . 

the problem is that this is a pure and shameless propaganda piece . one viewpoint is presented , then hammered upon the viewer over and over . you see the same handful of ' experts ' repeatedly making their case . the supposed ' narrator ' starts off sounding like a news reporter , but by the end even he is preaching the film ' s dogma . 

the dark side of the film is not so much the gloom and doom message about oil depletion , but the sense that the folks in the film are actually wishful for a post-oil society and all that it entails . they paint this picture of a utopian society where we all return to the self-contained local village model ; walk to work , shop locally , grow our own food , and generally live an idyllic 19th century lifestyle . for them , the post-oil society would seem a grand vision of a better world . it would certainly spell the end of globalization , and better still , the end of walmart . i will give them some credit for applying actual math in exposing the weaknesses of several over-touted alternative energy sources , including ethanol and hydrogen . 

i gave it 3 stars because i appreciated the old footage and the premise .  i caught this during a brief run in a philadelphia theater . despite its local provenance ( and its relation to a hometown tragedy , namely the beating death of eddie polec in 1994 ) , i really have to come down hard on this movie . the director , for reasons best known to himself , decided to shoot the entire film guerilla-style , with nonstop handheld cameras and rapidfire cuts . such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence , but is utterly inappropriate for the rest of the material , which makes up the majority of the film . a stroll down the sidewalk , a brother-to-brother discussion on a sofa , hell , even a kiss on a first-date are all shot cusinart-style , distracting this viewer from ever being able to enter into the drama . martin also undercuts his narrative by packing in far too many topics : besides the birth of mob violence , we get anorexia , alcoholism , divorce , racism , parental abuse . . . did i miss anything ? no doubt a better cast ( and a better-focused direction ) would have knit these threads together , as martin surely intended , to demonstrate how one moral flaw leads into and sustains a host of others . . . but good intentions do not necessarily a great film make . just a sprawling mess . martin , i know you ' re from my town , and i ' m down with you man , i really am . . . just do a better job next time , like you did in two plus one .  it ' s about jealousy , it ' s about racism , it ' s about manipulation , but the underlying message is love . geoffrey sax tried to pull off shakespeare ' s othello , by bringing it to modern day context . however , the actors were not convincing enough to pull this off . there were extra bodies to help put everything in to perspective , however , john othello , played by eamonn walker , over reacted a lot in this film , causing for the down fall of keeley hawes , dessie brabant , eventually ending in dessie ' s death . 

ben jago , played by christopher eccleston , was seen as the main character in the film . he didn ' t give enough evidence for dessie to be cheating on othello , with michael cass , played by richard coyle . instead he just played a friend to all and gave one reason as to why she " was " cheating . in the play , it took a lot more convincing from iago to make othello even suspect anything . this change made the movie more about rage for the wrong reasons , than what the book was based off of . however , the movie did have a few good points . it turned the army scenes into more a racist group toward blacks , where othello is the main chief of the police squad . these scenes are made believable by the raging crowds , and burning fires . you are able to sense the amount of racism in the movie , more so than you can in the book . this book plays up the modern day scenes by making it much easier to understand , than the shakespearian times it was written in . in the play iago ( jago ) gets tortured at the end , but in the film he gets his satisfaction , and gets othello ' s position . he never gets what he deserves and is never caught for telling the lie to othello until it is too late . i saw this as a downfall in the movie , because i feel that the villain is granted his treasure of the promotion out of lying , and in the book , he is found out by rodrigo . overall , the movie could have done a better job based on the play than what it did . i feel that the director of the movie left out some of the most important parts of the play that were mentioned or there to make the play flow , or make it more of a tragedy . i would say that you should read the book first , in order to understand all of the events that happened in the movie , otherwise you may find yourself lost , and confused .  i have been living in istanbul for 24 years and i ( a 39 years of experience would suggest ) do know what istanbul has gone through all those years . 

faith akin is still quite young ( born in 1973 ) and falling in the great mistake of being orientalist when looking at turkey ( just as his other movie gegen die wand did ) this movie seriously lack contemporary urban turkish life and misleads the audience when giving out ( quite false ) clues as to the geographical and cultural spreading of istanbul . 

anyone who could speak turkish could easily attest that many underground bands & groups depicted in the movie ( siyasiyabend for one ) are so miserable and their members cannot even speak a proper language that they cannot be taken as ' representatives ' of the contemporary turkish music . much less a piece of crap which many turkish listeners even do not know about at all . 

we turks have long been accustomed to ' superficious ' westerners who look at turkey with some orientalist point of view : trying to fit the actual turkish image into their mind molds . . what is new in this movie is the fact that now a turkish originated director ( faith akin ) is making the same mistake : looking at turkey with some false western glasses and scrambling to depict it as if he understands better . all of a vain effort . 

just ask any turkish friend of yours : what sort of a musical documentary is this without mentioning the names : zeki muren , baris manco , ajda pekkan , teoman , muslum gurses , ibrahim tatlises , ferdi ozbegen ? . . and many others who have shaped so far the real music we are listening today ? 

faith akin has a long long lesson to learn before babbling away and confusing other people ' s minds with false images about the contemporary turkish music .  algiers is not a classic , it is a perversion of the wonderful original pepe le moko , directed by duvivier and starring a much more attractive and charming pepe , jean gabin . if you want to fully experience the casbah and the characters in algiers , i recommend you don ' t even watch this movie and see pepe le moko instead , for it is much more elaborate , more beautifully filmed , the lines are not clichÃ©d and the characters adhere much more to reality . furthermore , the ending is so dramatic and key to pepe ' s character that you ' ll find the algiers version intolerable . although algiers does an almost excellent job mimicking each scene , the acting falls short as does the credibility of the characters . plus , the wardrobe is truly breath-taking in all scenes , particularly pepe ' s in the last scene and gaby ' s ( at all times ) but also when she ' s on the boat . frankly , algiers is cheap as far as imitations go .  first , let me mention the fact that , in spite of its title ( Â«storiesÂ» , in plural ) , there is only one kitchen story . as to whether isak died or not at the end , i ' m not so sure since , in one of the very last scenes , his pipe is seen lying on the table next to the two cups . on the dvd cover , there is a reference to tati . it claims that the film is Â«trÃ¨s drÃ´le : rappelle tati ! Â» ( Â«very funny : reminiscent of tati ! Â» . the great jacques tati relied mainly on mime and silent deadpan attitudes to achieve his comical effects and to offer his critically satiric views of his 1950âs french Â«modernÂ» society . of course Â«kitchenÂ» does take place during the 1950âs and it does offer some ( rather faint ) satirical references to the absurdities of bureaucracy and there are some long moments were no words are uttered -â but they are not really funny . are all these small details enough to make Â«kitchenÂ» a Â«tatiesqueÂ» movie ? this being said , i have to admit that Â«kitchenÂ» does deal with the sometimes false objectivity of scientific research versus the Â«truthÂ» of human subjective emotions . generally speaking , the movie was agonizingly slow , with nothing much happening -- with barely any Â«dramatic impulseÂ» : the involving parts were the set up during the first 15 minutes or so , and during the last half hour or so . indeed , the last segment was -- finally ! ! ! -- interesting and moving . it might seem that it was a short subject , of less than an hour , unduly stretched to some 90 minutes . now , about the set-up ( a Â«scientificÂ» observation on the behavior of single males in their kitchen ) : at first it seemed very promising â- with the charting out of the comings and goings of bachelors in their kitchen as a means to determine what new inventions would be most useful to come up with . but very quickly this premise turned out to be just a prologue , an Â«excuseÂ» to introduce the real subject which was only fully developed towards the end and which was about loneliness and the invaluable bond of friendship . pity ! i honestly wanted to like that movie . yes , it seemed so promising when i heard about some of its unusual little Â«anecdotesÂ» -- which were indeed there and which i enjoyed -â such as the burning of a manâs nose hair ( instead of using scissors to cut it off ) , the Â«investmentÂ» of having a huge quantity of Â«valuableÂ» black pepper stacked away in a barn , the role reversals ( the observant becoming the observed ) , a manâs mouth emitting sounds from a radio program . and there is also a sick horse becoming the catalyst of half-hidden human despair , the relative importance of right or left side car driving in sweden and norway ( a reflection of the importance for each of these very close neighboring countries to affirm its individuality ? ) . am i the sole person who did not fully enjoy that film ? does this necessarily mean that i ' m wrong ? perhaps itâs almost generally praised Â«fine pointsÂ» were , in fact , Â«too subtleÂ» for me ? perhaps . . . could my individual views on this movie ironically reflect the very essence of the film itself -- which would be the vital necessity to have the right to differ , to affirm oneâs individuality and not to follow blindly societyâs trends and opinions ? each one of us has the right to have different personal views and not to be a slave of the demands of oneâs bread-winning Â«dictatorialÂ» demands : often , we do have other alternatives that would allow each one of us to be useful to our society while respecting oneâs inner principles . in short , being true to oneself -â the way that in that film folke ( isakâs Â«scientific observerÂ» ) ends up by giving up his job while preferring to stay in his new friend isakâs house and help his out with the tasks of his farm . . . and so , Â«vive la diffÃ©renceÂ» , as the french say !   " a research scientist is experimenting with human dna in an attempt to create the perfect human being . his work has made it to the point where he can take a human fetus and accelerate its growth to that of an adult within a few days . his latest creation is a ( spoiler omitted ) , but side effects from the process ( spoiler omitted ) , " according to the dvd sleeve ' s synopsis . 

 " embryo " opens by promising : " the film you are about to see is not all science fiction . it is based upon medical technology which currently exists for fetal growth outside the womb . it could be a possibility tomorrow or today , " according to dr . charles m . brinkman iii . right . and , dr . joyce brothers appears , later , at a party with roddy mcdowall . 

first , we see rock hudson ( as dr . paul holliston ) light a cigarette and drive recklessly ( watch that speedometer ! ) during a storm ; unfortunately , he hits a dog . mr . hudson takes the wounded canine home . he learns it is pregnant , and manages to save the life of one of the puppies , due to his experimental knowledge of fetal growth . what this really boils down to is that hudson uses an experimental drug to grow the embryo , so that it can survive outside the mother ' s womb . the dog , " number one " , grows to adult-size rapidly , and is passed off as its mother . 

hudson lives with his sister-in-law diane ladd ( as martha douglas ) ; since his wife nicole , also a doctor , died in another car accident . ms . ladd seems more emotionally stable about nicole ' s death than hudson , who survived the crash that killed his wife . things begin to get creepy when hudson ' s dog shows an intelligence level far above any normal dog . then , hudson decides to use his accelerated embryo growth on a human , barbara carrera ( as victoria spencer ) . 

hudson and the cast try their best ; but , the " embryo " storyline is wretchedly absurd nonsense . if you take away her silly opening and closing scenes , ms . carrera ' s valiant characterization almost works ; she might have been a bigger star , if offered better films than this . the infantile ending suggests a sequel ; but , happily , the idea was aborted .  like a lot of movies involving little kids , this starts off " real cute " and likable . . . and then , after about a half hour or so , becomes the reverse . 

that ' s certainly the case here in this time-travel story ( which i usually love ) where an adult meets a kid who his really him at the age of eight ! great premise and a great lead actor in bruce willis , but . . . . . 

the kid " rusty " is a smart-aleck and whiny brat and willis rusty grown up now as " russell " gets abrasive with his constant yelling . that is entertainment ? no , thanks . 

young breslin has gone on to become a very good child actor , being involved in a number of films including " the cat in the hat " opposite a more famous child actor : dakota fanning . 

overall , a disappointing film , especially with all the good press this movie got when it was released .  it starts really interesting - the story develops around the main character , who runs a " cleaning business " , specialized in cleaning up crime scenes . as a former cop , he runs into some strange situation , when one job does suddenly " offically vanish " . furthermore , he discovers some relation to an investigation into police corruption . his " columbo feeling " is justified , the deeper he gets into the background of the story . the good actors ( jackson , ed harris , eva mendes ) play in an suspenseful story with some twists --- but only up to the last 25 minutes . ( up to here 7 of 10 stars ) . spoiler : : : : suddenly the movie looses its touch and in the end there is a completely unnecessary shoot-out , involving the 14-year old daughter , a betrayal of friendship and a not justified righteousness out of the character development . . . why not having cutler giving up his investigation for the sake of the friendship ? or having the daughter discovering some facts ? or . . . many possible much better story finishes are imaginable . . . a truly wasted ending !  last night i got to see an early preview screener of prozac nation . because i love everything that christina ricci does i was very excited at first , but as the movie continued i started to wonder where it was going . based on a true story , it is simply about christina ricci ' s character and her struggle with depression , drugs , friends and family as you can probably tell from the title . in my opinion this movie moved too fast , and it was way too dramatic . i would say there was a dramatic moment every five minutes , and the movie moved through her life extremely fast , and this left no room for us to connect with christina ricci ' s character . christina ricci ' s performance was fantastic as always but jessica lange stood out throughout the whole movie , and i believe this movie ' s success will be all because of her and christina ricci . i would rate this 4 out of 10 and i would suggest you rent this one or read the books by elizabeth wurtzel they are good and definitely worth checking out .  i went to see this movie tonight , trying to keep an open mind . i had hoped to enjoy a movie that i expected to be different from the book . there were considerable differences from the book , much like the changes made in the divinci code . i went to see the divinci code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film , in spite of , the changes from the book . it was still enjoyable , filled with action , and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating . unfortunately , angels and demons disappointed on almost every level . throughout the movie , symbols are found and figured out quickly , without any interest for the viewer . they blow past the various immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work . the final illuminati symbol , which was the most interesting and creative one in the book , was replaced with the crossed keys symbol . in my opinion , that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols , which is what the langdon character is all about . overall , this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book , and fails at the attempt to be an action movie / thriller . 4 out of 10 intended as light entertainment , this film is indeed successful as such during its first half , but then succumbs to a rapidly foundering script that drops it down . harry ( judd nelson ) , a " reformed " burglar , and daphne ( gina gershon ) , an aspiring actress , are employed as live window mannequins at a department store where one evening they are late in leaving and are locked within , whereupon they witness , from their less than protective glass observation point , an apparent homicide occurring on the street . the ostensible murderer , miles raymond ( nick mancuso ) , a local sculptor , returns the following day to observe the mannequins since he realizes that they are the only possible witnesses to the prior night ' s violent event and , when one of the posing pair " flinches " , the fun begins . daphne and harry report their observations at a local police station , but when the detective taking a crime report remembers harry ' s criminal background , he becomes cynical . there are a great many ways in which a film can become hackneyed , and this one manages to utilize most of them , including an obligatory slow motion bedroom scene of passion . a low budget affair shot in vancouver , even police procedural aspects are displayed by rote . the always capable gershon tries to make something of her role , but mancuso is incredibly histrionic , bizarrely so , as he attacks his lines with an obvious loose rein . although the film sags into nonsense , cinematographer glen macpherson prefers to not follow suit , as he sets up with camera and lighting some splendidly realised compositions that a viewer may focus upon while ignoring plot holes and witless dialogue . a well-crafted score , appropriately based upon the action , is contributed by hal beckett . the mentioned dialogue is initially somewhat fresh and delivered well in a bantering manner by nelson and gershon , but in a subsequent context of flawed continuity and logic , predictability takes over . the direction reflects a lack of original ideas or point of view , and post-production flaws set the work back farther than should be expected for a basic thriller .  some nameless aliens off on a distant ship from a distant planet have sent the giant robot kronos to rob the world of its energy . they ' ve got a prototype clanking around mexico for openers and if he proves successful more will be sent . it would certainly take a lot of time for just this one kronos to perform that task . 

for reasons i can ' t explain the aliens first capture the mind of leading scientist john emery who telepathically directs kronos to his first targets . since emery is killed off later and the monster seems to function well enough without emery as a controller , why the aliens needed him in the first place is a bit bizarre . 

in any event scientists jeff morrow , barbara lawrence , and george o ' hanlon who work under emery aren ' t fooled a bit about his nature . and of course they come up with a plan to deal with the raging metal giant . 

kronos is a perfect film for the fifties , the bad guys are never seen they ' re just out there looking to undermine mankind . it ' s a perfect film for the cold war . and jeff morrow assures us we ' ll be ready for them in the future . 

the players look like they ' re having a grand old time mouthing as many clichÃ©d lines the writers could put in the script . i get the impression that kronos is the kind of film ed wood might have done on a bigger budget with a bit more care .  i do not know which one was first released earlier in 1970 . cannon for cordoba is an " europen western " it was made in spain . this means this is fairly inferior to sergio leone ' s so-called # western spaghetti and to the real american masterpieces of john ford , sam peckinpah , howard hugues , john sturges and anthony mann , in my order of merit . this order is not to be interpreted as all john ford westerns are better than all by sam peckipahn ' s . i think imdb ' s 100 sort them out all pretty well . 

the worse about this firm is the casting . george peppard is fit for a sergeant ' s role , raff valone for a " maffia capo " and giovanna ralli to a " puttana " in " piazza vennezia " in the sixty ' s in rome .  yumiko ( wakana sakai ) , the pretty adopted daughter of a recently-deceased japanese businessman , inherits control of her father ' s company ; her uncle kazuo ( shun sugata ) , miffed that he wasn ' t left the business to run , orders a hit on his niece . when jug-eared chef kensuke ( takashi okamura ) enters the wrong hotel room by mistake and knocks out hit-man invincible ( jung yuen ) , he is mistaken for the killer and sent to kill yumiko . instead , he falls for the pretty heiress and ends up vowing to protect her . however , she is kidnapped by kazuo ' s men while kensuke is preoccupied playing an arcade game with cop daniel ( sam lee ) . 

uncle kazuo keeps yumiko in a hypnotic trance , and takes control of the business , but runs into a spot of bother himself , when his gangster pals threaten to reveal his illegal activities unless he allows them total control . 

meanwhile , kensuke teams up with two martial arts experts , lam kau ( yuen baio ) and lam doi ( candy lo ) who are hunting invincible . he learns kung fu and attempts to free yumiko . 

a mixture of broad slapstick humour , spoofery and fight scenes , no problem 2 is a disappointing film considering the talent involved : 80s kung fu superstar yuen baio manages a few fight scenes but is getting a little old for acrobatics these days ; director kar lok chin delivers the kind of dumb parody schtick i ' d expect from a scary movie film ; jung yuen resorts to mocking his character in operation scorpio ; and sam lee well , sam lee is as annoying as always ! 

on the other hand , collin chou , as gangster ben , impressed me ; he has an obviously strong screen presence which has not gone unnoticed by hollywoodÂhe has since starred in two of the matrix movies and is soon to appear in d . o . a . , directed by corey yuen . i was also impressed by wakana sakai , but for an entirely different reason : this beauty is easy on the eye and should go much further in the film business . 

there is some fun to be had from working out what movies are being parodied , but at 104 minutes i found this film a real chore to sit through . if people pulling funny faces accompanied by silly sound effects makes you burst your sides laughing , then no problem 2 might appeal to you . otherwise , i would leave well alone .  as a south african , living in south africa again after a 32 year stay in the uk , i am sorry to say that this movie is a huge disappointment . the three main problems i had with the movie was a ) why swank and ejiofor - an american and a nigerian - to play the leads . this country is bursting with talent and has no need of imports . . . b ) gillian slovo has been trading off her struggle credentials for years now . she ' s a very mediocre writer and even her novel doesn ' t stand up the flaccid direction of mr hooper . . . and c ) hilary swank again , such a great actor , as proved in million dollar baby ( but that ' s eastwood too ) , here dressed in the contemporary new york style whilst roaming freely around the poverty of the karoo . where was the consideration and sensitivity needed by the costumer and director ? yes , the film is ultimately moving - how could it not be ? - but the overall mood at the conclusion is one of tremendous letdown . heart ' s in the right place but needs a pace maker .  hands of the ripper

an edwardian doctor ( eric porter ) uses newfangled freudian analysis on a young girl ( angharad rees ) who turns out to be the daughter of jack the ripper , and just as deadly . . . 

unlikely hammer horror , in which a respectable society figure takes charge of a beautiful young waif without attracting so much as a whiff of scandal , even when she takes to murdering all and sundry with a variety of lethal implements ( broken mirrors , hat-pins , etc . ) ! l . w . davidson ' s screenplay wanders aimlessly from one murder to another , sacrificing the material ' s inherent subtext ( porter ' s obvious attraction to rees ) in favor of commercial melodrama , and the tone remains subdued throughout . some of the gore scenes are surprisingly vivid , even for hammer , and these were clipped from the original us release ( despite an r rating from the mpaa ) , though the complete version is now available on home video . porter and rees give excellent performances , and the climax in st . paul ' s cathedral is a definite highlight , but the rest of the film is strangely hollow and unaffecting . directed by peter sasdy .  lois weber ' s film " hypocrites " was and still kind of is a very bold and daring film . i enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and story of it . the priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the " naked " truth . the people are appalled when he reveals the naked statue portraying truth , after failing to lead them to it and the few that did , help along the way . the people do not want to face the truth that they are doing anything wrong , but it shows them putting things before god , going to beach parties acting inappropriate , their materialistic ways , and other things in which the people of our world do that tend to not be morally right . in the end , failing to gain any followers , he must enter into the gates of heaven alone . this film seems to me to be very bold , in the fact that a naked woman is shown throughout it , especially considering the time period in which this film was made . the imagery and symbolism portrayed in this movie i found incredible . the way they made the naked woman translucent and using a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art . showing the different sins of the people as they walked down the road and refused to follow along the path , each with different excuses , setbacks , and / or higher priorities , was a great way of representing the people of today . this film does a very good job of getting the moral message across to its audience . lois weber has a tremendous way of capturing her spectators ' attention with her creativity , symbolism , visuals , and through auditory . even the music of the piano throughout this film is very beautiful and fitting with the whole theme .  the gang is back for more ! ron howard and cindy williams are now married ! her brother is demonstrating against the draft and charles martin smith is doing everything he can in vietnam to get sent home . 

the issues of the 60 ' s are brought to light here , but it ' s all over the place , beginning with new year ' s eve 1963 , then three minutes later , it ' s new year ' s eve 1964 , then three minutes later , it ' s new year ' s eve 1965 , then three minutes later , it ' s back to 1963 again . martin smith is talking about his friend dying in a drag race a year ago , and a couple of scenes later , this friend is winning his next heat in a drag race and to top it all off , the drug scene and the flower children enter the picture ( or pictures , in some cases , as many as three different camera shots are shown on the screen at the same time ) . 

if you want to watch this film , you have to watch this film , but i ' d advise you to stick to the original and leave it there . wolfman jack is heard in the beginning of the film before almost every song played in the background , but where ' d he go ? maybe he couldn ' t keep up with this film , either , and quit ! 2 out of 10 stars !  an aging roger moore is back yet again as bond , this time trying to find out why agent 009 was killed , and why he had a forgery of a faberge egg with him , and where it came from . he ends up in new delhi india , then in east germany after finding out about a russian general trying to detonate a nuclear bomb at a circus , hoping nato will push for complete disarmament , so he can take control of western europe , then the rest of the world . 

despite the way it sounds , this is really more of a romance , i think , between bond and octopussy than an action movie , and longish , but still somewhat fun . but there are way too many attempts at humour in this one ; at times it seems like it was intended to be a comedy . also , timothy dalton would have been better than roger moore in this , so there wouldn ' t have been so much of an age difference between bond and octopussy . 

useless trivia : the small plane used by bond in the pre credits sequence is now hanging up in a quaker steak and lube restaurant in clearwater / largo area florida , usa . 

 * * 1 / 2 out of * * * *  this has to rate as one of the cheesiest of tv shows in a long time . 

jose ferrer played the title character , nemo . he did the part justice and certainly looked the part . but nowadays , it strikes me that the nemo he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to captain bird ' s eye , from the tv commercials . or maybe it ' s the other way around . 

his nemesis , professor cunningham , was overacted brilliantly by burgess meredith . he never seemed to get over his " penguin " days from batman . although he doesn ' t do his penguin " quack " here , he is without parallel as the maniacal professor . only john colicos , of battlestar galactica fame , chewed up the scenery better as a maniacal despot . 

i never can recall what the grudge was between nemo and cunningham , but it must have been severe , since the prof . never missed a chance to try and scupper nemo , and vice-versa . 

the effects were nothing special , though prof . cunningham ' s submarine was way better looking than nemo ' s . it also had a crew of strange , fish-like amphibians that served cunningham and did his every bidding . 

however , the most memorable aspect of the whole show was prof . cunningham ' s secret weapon . the delta beam ! he was forever saying " fire delta beam ! " , whereupon , a fishy crewman would horribly overract the motion of firing the weapon by use of a full shoulder shrug . truly priceless ! they don ' t make them like this anymore , and perhaps just as well . but like other series of this era , for those who remember it , it will always have an affectionate , if cheddar-covered , place in our hearts .  ridiculous film where two swinging college graduates move out to california and one becomes a movie star and the other his manager . 

as 10 years pass , the star ' s popularity is decreasing so it is determined that there will be a television show where women will compete for his affection . 

the film is obnoxious and ridiculous . the girls who vie for lover boy are made to look foolish . only one girl seems to be the choice of the producer of the show . she is really an amateur up against some of the other women , but she is wholesome and brings good ratings to the show as well . 

by the third scene you realize that the manager is falling for her . 

we know that ryan really was meant to be a bachelor . while the ending is somewhat cute , you really know where this was going .  the scriptwriters , directors , and actors have lost sight of the cornerstone of a good story - the concept of suspension of disbelief . in volcano , the concept goes up in smoke almost as quickly as the city . contrary to earlier commentators , i much preferred dantes peak amongst the 97 vintage of volcano movies .  based on the comments made so far , everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it . i think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a great movie , it has its interesting moments . for one thing , it was filmed on location in colorado ( was it breckinridge or telluride ? i can ' t remember , but it is in the credits ) . the location is absolutely stunning and spectacular . it ' s beautiful , even to me who lived in colorado for several years . 

next , it has disney ' s penchant for wonderful character actors . harry morgan has never been in better form than when he plays in a disney movie . he is literally hysterical . also , remember the wonderful mary wickes ? although she has a " bit part " in this movie , she is great , as always . if you don ' t know who she is , think of the animated disney version of hunchback from notre dame ( she was one of the gargoyles ) , and she was also the most interesting nun in " sister act " , as well as the best nun in " the trouble with angels . " she has always been a great character actress and most character actors never receive the recognition they deserve . 

in addition to character actors and all-star casts , in the 1960s-1970s disney may have not had the " greatest " movies , but , if you really watch some of them from beginning to end , you will notice that every movie has some really funny or hysterical moment in it . the entire movie may not be funny , but there is always a comic gem ( at least 1 or 2 ) in every single " live-action " movie disney ever made . whether it ' s harry morgan in one of his bellowing tones of voice , or tim conway floundering around , or joe flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror , it is all good . the whole film may not be good , but there are always hysterical moments in every disney film from this period that i have ever seen . disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile , despite the dumbness of the film . 

bsed on these comments , i disagree with viewers who say every disney movie in this time period is awful . that statement it not quite accurate . rather , it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and overlook the weaknesses in the plots . 

some live-action disney movies are true classics ( old yeller , bedknobs and broomsticks , mary poppins ) , but for those that aren ' t , i am able to appreciate them for what they were -- good clean family fun in a time when movies had become vulgar , crude and offensive .  i ' m afraid i did not like this adaptation . when i started watching it i had a strange feeling of watching some 70s tv series , due to the filter and the musical score . i did not like the end scene . mr tilney appears dressed only in his waistcoat . jane austen would never have a gentleman ride out without a frock coat . looks like the producers made a modern misinterpretation of a romantic girl ' s dream . i appreciate the more modern ja adaptations much more , that show an eye for these details , that makes the bbc series so worthwhile . sorry , looking forward to the 2007 adaptation . i hope that will be better and will show the benefits of 20 years of jane austen adaptations .  low-budget murder mystery about a public defender trying to clear his client of a murder the man had been convicted of 12 years previously . complicating things is the fact that he escaped custody after his conviction , but the pd believes the man to be innocent of the murder and works to find the real killer . gig young as the pd is okay , and james anderson as the convicted killer is actually pretty good , but the picture as a whole just rambles along with little suspense , and despite some good character actors in the cast , the performances are generally below par . director george archainbaud was apparently more at home making westerns--he was churning out gene autry ' s tv series at columbia at around this time--but even if he had tried to inject any liveliness into this picture , the hack script would have defeated his attempts . average at best , the film climaxes with a courtroom scene that ' s straight out of an episode of " perry mason " and is just as predictable .  i wish i knew what to make of a movie like this . it seems to be divided into two parts -- action sequences and personal dramas ashore . it follows ashton kutsher through survival swimmer school , guided by master chief kevin costner , then to alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues take place , the last resulting in death . 

i must say that the scenes on the beach struck me as so stereotypical in so many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted . a typical bar room fight between navy guys and coast guardsmen ( " puddle pirates " ) . the experienced old timer costner who is , as an elderly bar tender tells him , " married to the coast guard . " the older chief who " keeps trying to prove to himself that he ' s still nineteen . " the neglected ex wife ashore to whom kostner pays a farewell visit . the seemingly sadistic demands placed on the swimmers by the instructors , all in pursuit of a loftier goal . the gifted young man hobbled by a troubled past . 

the problem is that we ' ve seen it all before . if it ' s kevin costner here , it ' s clint eastwood or john wayne or lou gosset jr . or vigo mortenson or robert deniro elsewhere . and the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly from " the perfect storm " and " dead calm . " none of it is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are handled with any originality . 

it works best as a kind of documentary of what goes on in the swimmer ' s school and what could happen afterward and even that ' s a little weak because we don ' t get much in the way of instruction . it ' s mostly personal conflict , romance , and tension about washing out . 

it ' s a shame because the u . s . coast guard is rather a noble outfit , its official mission being " the safety of lives and property at sea . " in war time it is transferred to the navy department and serves in combat roles . in world war ii , the coast guard even managed to have a medal of honor winner in its ranks . 

but , again , we don ' t learn much about that . we don ' t really learn much about anything . the film devolves into a succession of visual displays and not too much else . a disappointment .  the key scene in rodrigo garcia ' s " nine lives " comes when sissy spacek , hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with aiden quinn , find a nature documentary on television , at which point quinn notes the contrivance of such things--disparate footage is edited into one scene , predators and preys are thrown together in order to capture the moment--all to force connections where none actually exist . characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally spill over into each others stories , but none of them ever seem to really connect . a woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is later seen working in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy . a man who runs into an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been later hosts , with his current wife , a dinner party for an unhappy couple . garcia arranges some of his characters in front of each other , but none of the subsequent stories ever really build on what came before . 

garcia ' s first film , the wonderful , overlooked " things you can tell just by looking at her , " also had a short-story structure and overlapping characters , but there were fewer of them and they had a lot more room to breathe and grow . the gimmicky premise of " nine lives , " that each of its nine stories is told in a single , unbroken take in real time , never allows the film to build up any real dramatic tension or momentum . it ' s also a fairly visually ugly movie . interior shots are often murky and hard to watch , while other scenes--particularly one where a girl walks back and forth between rooms to talk to her uncommunicative parents--are rendered annoying by the camera-work . given that this is garcia ' s third film and that he has a respectable history of directing for television , the direction in this film is rather surprisingly amateurish . like fellow filmmaker-child-of-a-great-writer rebecca miller , garcia ( son of gabriel garcia marquez ) is focused on the writing and character aspects of his films often to the detriment of the film-making ones . 

individual scenes are touching and even affecting . i did like jason issacs kissing robin wright penn ' s pregnant belly . and joe mantegna whispering lovingly to his wife as she slips into pre-surgery sedation . and sissy spacek stealing a few happy moments away from her life with aiden quinn before brought back to it with a phone call from her daughter . but the film ( unlike " things you can tell just by looking at her " ) feels more like an exercise than actual drama . we are just watching people act .  daft potboilers don ' t come much dafter than this , but it ' s a douglas sirk movie which makes everything alright . except in this case it doesn ' t . based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious lloyd c douglas , ( he wrote " the robe " ) , and already filmed in 1935 with irene dunne and robert taylor , it ' s got more uplift than a cantilever bra . 

rock hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making jane wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight . to make amends he takes up medicine , becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it . ( no , it sin ' t quite that daft ; he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy ) . in between times , they fall in love . 

try as i might i can ' t quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of sirk ' s films , ( this one isn ' t too deep ) . on the plus side rock hudson isn ' t half bad , ( i think i am rediscovering him ) , and , of course , it looks great , ( in sirk ' s films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals ) . nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soap-opera terms this is definitely daytime tv .  jack bender ' s " the tempest " is an adaption of shakespeare ' s play " the tempest " . bender transports the plot from medieval italy to mississippi during the time of the american civil war . he includes the slavery problem and the role of revenge in wartimes . 

prospero , re-named gideon prosper is not the duke of milan but a landowner in mississippi . he learns voodoo magic from the female slave mambo azaleigh . he saves her son ariel , who thus accompanies him into his exile . the island is not situated on the sea but in a swamp near the banks of the mississippi . there lives an alligator hunter , a so-called " gator-man " , who later tries to rape prospero ' s daughter miranda . during the time of the civil war , ariel wants to join the union troops to help fighting against slavery . prospero does not care about the war . he is only interested in his personal revenge on his brother antony . when antony and his bookkeeper willi gonzo ( gonzalo ) try to cross the river , prospero raises a storm . the union soldier frederick gets lost in the swamp and finally comes to the island . he and miranda fall in love with each other but prospero won ' t accept that . meanwhile , ariel transformed into a raven by prospero , finds out that antony has feigned to ally with the union but plans to betray them . antony and gonzo meet gator man in the swamp and conspire with him against prospero . they kidnap miranda and ariel but prospero freeze them and helps the union defeat the southern army . in the end ariel is free , frederick and miranda are bound to marry , prospero returns to the plantation and gator man gets back the island . 

peter fonda represents gideon prosper powerfully and convincingly while the character of antony stays rather flat . it was no bad idea to perform the tempest before the background of the civil war but perhaps the director has risked too much . in some parts the story seems constructed or comical . gator man for example does just appear without any explanation . that it needs a kidnapping to bring prospero to his mind and that he loses confidence in his power shows that bender tried to make prospero more human but only made him a weak old man without his magic . prospero ' s original authority and wisdom is not made clear . 

-------------end of part 1---------------------------- whoever likened this one to raiders of the lost ark certainly knew whereof he spoke . he might , as well , have likened it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed . " kay hoog " reminds one more than a little of both lamont cranston ( the shadow ) and clark savage ( doc savage ) . ( the shadow , quintessential man of mystery- and the very first " dark knight " - was also thought to be one kent allard . if one were to take savage ' s first name first and add to it the kent , you end up with- voila- clark kent . funny , innit ? ) like indiana jones , hoog isn ' t above pilfering the artifacts of an ancient civilization ( though his thefts are often more blatant and less " charmingly roguish " than jones ' s ) . unfortunately , this two-parter is a far cry from subsequent serials ( from any era ) in terms of overall quality . one of the first indications that something is amiss vis a vis the cinematic storytelling is a scene where desperados on horseback , quite literally breathing down his neck , simply watch as hoog escapes their clutches in a hot air balloon . why they don ' t bother to shoot down the balloon is just one of the many movie-making mysteries that plague these two films . 

the second half of this two-parter is even worse than the first . granted , this was one of the first ever serials and , as such , should be cut a bit of slack- but there are limits , even , to tolerance . ( at one point , the capture of the hero is effected not on screen , but in the narration itself ! talk about cutting corners . . . ) fritz lang happens to be one of the greatest filmmakers to ever make films ; unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did , the spiders is a bitter pill indeed to swallow . . .   " the apartment complex " is a campy comedy full of kookie characters created in lieu of a real story which tells a young psych student ( lowe ) who takes a job managing an apartment complex and becomes embroiled in a murder mystery . . . um , if you can call it that . this low cal watch contains no suspense , no thrills , no drama , no action , precious few funny moments , a dash of nudity , and almost no romance . " the apartment complex " is passable , forgettable junk food for only the most needy couch potatoes .  this film should be called adventures in cinemascope . it is like the screenwriter and director tooks the cliff ' s notes page 3 outline and decided that this would be a great vehicle for a film about the italian alps . rock hudson is pretty good here , but the dialogue bears no resemblance to hemingway at all . this is a made up version of hemingway . hecht , the screenwriter , is a hack . watch the 1932 version with gary cooper and helen hayes . that is great cinema and was made by someone who understood hemingway and the war in northern italy . gary cooper is very , very good compared to his performance in for whom the bell tolls where he is stiff as a board and thinks he is in a western . 

anyway , if you are a hemingway fan , do yourself a favor and do not watch this film . your best bet is to get the unabridged audio cd and just listen to one of the greatest novels ever written .   " riders of destiny " was the first of several westerns wayne made for the lone star arm of monogram pictures between 1933 and 1935 . in this entry , the producers try to make the duke into a singing cowboy called " singin ' sandy saunders with hilarious results . any wayne fan knows that the duke couldn ' t have carried a tune if his life had depended on it . his voice was apparently dubbed by smith ballew whose deep baritone sounds nothing like wayne . wayne looks awkward and uncomfortable in " performing " the musical numbers . thank heavens the singing cowboy experiment soon ended . 

as for the movie itself , it contains a standard " b " western plot of the fight over water rights between the villain ( forrest taylor ) and the local ranchers . duke , of course plays the hero . he had not yet developed his on screen character and still looked like a poverty row cowboy . 

also cast in the film were george ( pre-gabby ) hayes as the heroine ' s father , cecilia parker as the heroine and yakima canutt as " one of the boys " who performs his " falling from the racing horses under the wagon " stunt while doubling wayne . both canutt and hayes would go on to appear with wayne in most of the other entries in the series . canutt , in particular would have a profound effect on wayne ' s future development teaching him , among other things , how to move , fight and look comfortable on a horse . 

as " b " westerns go this one isn ' t too bad , however , i have to give it a failing grade because of the " singing " .  this love story between an american journalist and an eurasian lady doctor does not contain much conflict , since she is largely westernized ( having studied in london ) , nor any fireworks , since she behaves rather restrained . what little interest the story manages to raise is knocked down further by their wooden dialogs . they are supposed to be two cosmopolitan intellectuals , but talk as if the words are put in their mouths by a hollywood hack who is not much of one himself . the movie also suffers from an amazing lack of realism - a completely deserted beach in crowded little hongkong , overrun by a million chinese refugees ? and a presumably accomplished american journalist in his 40s who doesn ' t know what a hysterectomy is ? hollywood ideas . finally " the song " . after hearing it an estimated twenty times throughout the movie , starting right with the credits , it tends to loose some of its emotional impact , sorry to say .  i was pleasantly surprised with this one . it ' s actually quite interesting and engaging . the cast is strong , even dan cortese . brooke shields has come into her own as an actress . black and white must have really set her free , ' cause i have never seen her in this much command playing a conventional character . if marketed right , could be a medium-size hit .  you would think that a film that starred three of the biggest male film stars of the post world war ii era would have become a classic . these three who also happen to be three favorites of mine , walk around in a daze , looking like they ' d rather be any place , but there . 

the sad thing is that the way west definitely had some potential to be a classic . in these days of political correctness , a film about american pioneers and the travails of their westward migration is something not done now . it should have been better done back then . 

kirk douglas is a former united states senator who ' s heading a wagon train west to build a settlement in oregon ' s willamette valley . being he ' s an ex-politician , he rates above the hoi ploi he ' s leading . the script calls for him to have not only a covered wagon , but a carriage to lead the train . 

you think that ' s ludicrous , you ought to see the whipping scene where douglas orders his black servant , played by roy glenn to whip him . i won ' t spoil it by saying what causes douglas to demand this of glenn , but trust me , it ' s bad . 

robert mitchum is the trail guide and of the three stars he looks the most bored . there was supposed to be considerable friction on the set between widmark and douglas , but mitchum just saunters through the film above it all . 

maybe the friction helped somewhat because the movie calls for douglas , a widower , to have an eye on mrs . widmark , played by lola albright . now she ' s the best looking thing in the movie . 

the film billing says introducing sally field . this was made in between her gidget and her flying nun days . she plays a piece of white southern trash with the musical comedy name of mercy mcbee . we first see her in the movie sitting on the back of her parents wagon , legs akimbo and inviting . of course she gets taken up on her invitation . 

her character is something like what ' s found in every trailer park in america and then again what was a wagon train , but one large trailer park on the move . 

despite this film , sally field went on to a two oscar career . what that woman had to overcome . 

victor mclaglen ' s son andrew directed this item and together with a lousy script turned this into a turgid mess . shame on andrew mclaglen , he ' s certainly done better in his career . 

and so will you , unless you ' re a stargazer .  i believe an entire book can be written about the odyssey to remake the classic film on which this film is loosely based . when hollywood first started talking about such enterprise , the reaction was always negative because there were just too many aspects that could have gone wrong , starting with the solid ensemble that made the original unforgettable , and that ' s exactly where things begin souring here , with the selection of actresses that otherwise can do remarkable work , but that are not suited to the parts , and sadly enough , have been directed with the heavy hand of a director that doesn ' t understand or appreciate the source material . 

it seems as if there is no focus or direction , or as if the direction that has been taken is to obliterate anything that was good about the original film . this is called an updating , as in let ' s drain the story out of humor , snappy dialogue , and any interesting premise . most of all , let ' s prove that women have come a long way , except that the problem is that we don ' t really get ( at least by watching this film ) where the women are truly going . 

for starters , casting meg ryan in the central role proves almost fatal to the movie because somehow she seems to have locked herself into some sort of limbo where women don ' t really change appearances , even after 20 years of working in the movies . her mary which proved to be a difficult role in the 30 ' s , somehow grew from her interaction with the other stereotypes , like dorothy in " the wizard of oz " by learning , observing , and realizing that she had a choice in the matter . it might not have been a choice that women would celebrate nowadays , but it was fun ride , and part of the fun , was the catty , silly , sometimes slapstick routines that elevated that movie into the realm of the sublime . in here , we are down to earth with a thud . by changing the nature of sylvia , the film has lost a lot of its spark , and it isn ' t in anyway annette bening ' s fault . i couldn ' t help but admiring how she tried to save this sinking ship and got a sinking feeling as she struggled with the horrible lines she was handled . thankfully i entertained myself by looking at some of her terrific outfits and kept reminding myself how talented this lady really was . her sylvia is wise but flawed , and she could have been a great creation . unfortunately ms . english wasn ' t paying attention to her own work and loses control of the one character that could have turned the film into a fresh direction . 

yet that wasn ' t the biggest blasphemy of them all . in the original , we have joan crawford doing probably one of the best performances by a woman . her crystal is legendary , with conniving lines , incendiary moves , duplicitous maneuvers , and some very sexy poses . she was the link between the male and the female , and through her we knew what the whole catastrophe was about . she provided the tension between men and women . she was dangerous , sexy , the ultimate femme fatale . a woman of intelligence that we feared and admired , and most importantly , we wanted to destroy to save our heroine . eva mendes , as gorgeous as she is , is two dimensional in this outing because of weak writing , and once again , some bad casting . 

there are more atrocities in the film , such as the addition of a terrible role for mensing as the dedicated mother who lives for having babies , and the rather annoying lesbian turn by pinkett . then comes the biggest waste of talent in the movie , as bette middler , who is a little unrecognizable in her make up , shows the spark of what could have been . her acidic delivery reminds us of the contemporary angle the film could have taken . her words revive and put a big of much needed naughtiness in the film , and it is exciting to see that it could really fly , then she is gone . she is in the film all of six minutes , and she fades away in the middle of the muddle . 

here is a movie that raised our anticipation level and truly disappointed us , a film that could have joined the successful " sex in the city " who made an amazing transition to the big screen because it respected its source material and didn ' t compromise . it gave us more , bigger and better adaptation . it truly updated what had made it successful before . " the women " in its present reincarnation needs to go back and rework itself , much like " the hulk " did it this year , find more suitable performers , a really good writer , and most of all , someone who truly treasures what good movies are about .  george burns returns as the joshing almighty after enjoying a big success with 1977 ' s " oh , god ! " , an upbeat fantasy made successful by a sudden need in the 1970s to switch from devil-driven thrillers to comedic redemption ( although it made money , the original was more in line with the " topper " comedies of the ' 30s than a return to feel-good religious cinema ) . here , god appears to a young girl ( louanne , who had earlier starred in a stage production of " annie " ) and asks her to spread his divine word , causing her nothing but trouble from grown-ups in the process . peculiar , family-oriented film appears to be warm-hearted enough , and burns gets to chime in with a nice barrage of wry jibes , but the writing is half-slapstick and half-seriousness , with the adults of the piece considering putting little louanne away , all of which makes god seem more like a troublemaker than an elderly friend . louanne is another problem : a perky kid with wizened little eyes , she is untrained for screen-acting and occasionally seems awkward . the medium-budget production has a gloppy , tv-movie appearance , with few graceful touches . the final scene mimics the climax of the first " oh , god ! " in that it brings a wistful sentiment to the mix , which is welcomed . it ' s the most subtle moment in the movie . * * from * * * *  this is the first and as far as i can tell , the only completed production of " heart of darkness " ever released . prior to starting on " citizen kane , " orson welles shot some test footage for a version of " heart of darkness " that was to be filmed entirely in what would now be called " pov " , where we would see everything from the point of view of the main character charlie marlow ; he would be seen only fleetingly in mirrors , windows , water , etc . the film was never made . the " pov " technique was used , not too successfully , in 1947 in " the lady in the lake , " with robert montgomery starring as philip marlowe . presumably , the coincidence of the two " marlow ( e ) " characters is just that . of course , francis coppola ' s " apocalypse now " was based on " heart of darkness . " 

the short novel " heart of darkness " by the polish-born british writer joseph conrad , first serialized in a british literary magazine in 1899 , features one of his favorite alter egos , ship captain charlie marlow , who also narrates the short story " youth " and indirectly tells the story of " lord jim . " marlow , temporarily out of work , decides to take a job captaining a river boat for a belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of king leopold ii ' s personal fiefdom , the cruelly misnamed congo free state . marlow travels from london to brussels , signs on with the company , and is told that his mission is to take a boat up the congo river to a far inland station headed by one of the company ' s most productive agents in the colony , a german named kurtz . shipments of ivory , latex ( for the production of rubber ) and other products from kurtz ' s station have ceased , and no word has come downriver from kurtz for some time . there are rumors that he has " gone native . " marlow is to investigate , take any necessary action , and make a report on his return . he takes passage down the west african coast to the mouth of the congo , is delayed for weeks while he is forced to repair his boat at the company station on the coast , and finally sets out upriver to find kurtz ' s station . the river , the heat , the vegetation , the wildlife , the insects , the people , all take their toll on his endurance , his imagination , and his mental resources . he finds kurtz ill , half-mad , and close to death . the final encounter and the death of kurtz are almost an anticlimax , especially since conrad is so obscure about what actually happens that we are left to puzzle it out for ourselves . this is a novel where you close the book vaguely dissatisfied with the ending but nevertheless treasuring the story for its amazing atmospherics . 

this " heart of darkness " was filmed with guyana in central america standing in for west africa . it is best where the novel is at its greatest disadvantage : actually showing us first world urbanites what a boat trip up a tropical river would look like . but the rest of the film was forgettable . tim roth does his best as marlow , but so much about the plot , characterizations , and character relationships has been altered beyond recognition that you wonder why they bothered . if the aim was to make conrad ' s story for the screen , why didn ' t they leave it alone ? it ' s unreasonable to expect that no compromises will be made when a book is made into a movie , but so many changes were made that to me had no cinematic justification that you wonder whether we are simply dealing with incompetent screenwriters and cinematographers . most disappointing of all was john malkovich as kurtz . he was completely miscast and simply flubs the role . everything about him is wrong : his looks , his acting style , his voice , his accent , everything . a vastly better choice would have been someone like bruno ganz ( unlike malkovich , an actual german , like the character ) . 

this is a very disappointing production and i would recommend it only after you ' ve read the book if you want to depend on more than your imagination to get a visual picture of a boat trip up the congo river circa 1900 .  okay , so it was never going to change the world , and it bombed at the box office , but honky tonk freeway is one of those films i fell in love with as a child ( the bbc showed it a few times during the 1980s and i happened to have a high quality vhs tape in the machine - lucky , that ! ) and watched endlessly . i watched the dvd last night and sadly , time has not been kind to this would-be blockbuster . either that or i ' ve just grown out of this kind of broad , dopey humour . come on , when schlesinger is so desperate for laughs he gives us close-ups of novelty underpants with ' amusing ' slogans , what can you say about the cast or screenplay ? 

certainly , it ' s ambitious , interesting , unusual and sprawling , but it ' s never once laugh-out-loud funny . i ' d describe it as a children ' s film with some ' adult ' overtones - you can safely let your youngsters watch this , despite the 15 certificate . they won ' t get the drug references , so don ' t worry about it . i had a pleasant surprise when i realized i ' d forgotten just how catchy both the title song and the song-writing truck driver ' s ' everybody ' s going faster , faster ' song were , not to mention the town of ticlaw ' s patriotic anthem . the whole cast give commendable performances , the photography is crisp and captures the mood of the various locations perfectly , and there ' s a real time capsule feeling about the fashions , the cars , the gadgets ( especially the dashboard-mounted drum machine ) , the interiors and the pop-culture references - i was more than a little surprised to hear the nutty bum in the bank loudly telling everyone " i ' m oj simpson ! " , particularly now simpson ' s legal tangles have overshadowed his sporting achievements . the snag is , there ' s almost no plot to speak of , it ' s way too obvious to be witty and not funny enough to elicit many genuine laughs . i wish i ' d left this one as a pleasant memory .  this film is one of the worst adaptations of pride and prejudice ever filmed and if jane austen were alive , she would demand that her name be removed from the film . austen ' s novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between elizabeth bennet and fitzwilliam darcy . it is also a commentary on the class structure of regency britain . this film focuses only on the love story , thereby disappointing viewers who hoped it would do justice to the novel . 

there are numerous problems with the historical accuracy of the film . in the film , the dance at which darcy snubs elizabeth is not the refined dancing done by the gentry , to which the bennet , lucas , bingley , and darcy families belong , but is rather the dancing of the lower classes . the gentry would not have been dancing as if they were at a peasant barn dance . there are costume and hair problems , too . the custom of the period required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and for women to wear bonnets when outdoors . women of the regency period were not so liberated as to forego the bonnet requirements in public . the worst historical inaccuracy is the early morning meeting of elizabeth ( in her nightgown and coat ) and mr . darcy ( sans cravat and vest ) at which they admit their love for each other . this is an unforgivable liberty with the novel . no respectable young woman or gentleman would venture out of doors in such a state of undress or seek to meet someone of the opposite sex at such an early hour . 

but the worst thing of all with this film is the mangling of austen ' s dialogue and the atrocious modern dialogue . austen ' s dialogue needs no assistance from a writer who thinks he / she can write like austen . the writer of the non-austen dialogue not only lacks austen ' s talent but also has no feel for austen ' s style . the juxtaposition of the two styles is jarring . 

as for the acting , the best is done by judi dench , who clearly understands the imperiousness of the aristocracy . brenda blethyn takes some liberties in making mrs . bennet less awful than austen ' s portrayal . her portrayal is interesting and seems to work . donald sutherland is miscast . his affected british accent is terrible and he portrays mr . bennet too much as a father of the 20th century and not a father of the late 18th century . matthew macfadeyn ' s portrayal of darcy is flat . i can ' t imagine anyone falling in love with his mr . darcy . keira knightly is a pretty elizabeth , but her portrayal of elizabeth bennet is far too modern . knightly focuses on the elizabeth ' s forthrightness , but her portrayal completely lacks an understanding of the social mores and conventions of the time . she would have done well to actually read the novel before attempting to portray elizabeth and to do research on the behavior of women of the period . 

if one is making a period movie , one must be true to the period . this film needed an historical adviser who actually knows something about the regency period . it also needed a writer who has a better appreciation and understanding of austen ' s text . i can only hope emma thompson decides to do a film of pride and prejudice in the near future to erase this abomination from our minds . 

the best thing that can be said about this film is that it contains many pretty scenes of the english countryside . chatsworth is well used as pemberly ( as it was in the 1995 bbc adaptation ) . but pretty scenery and pretty actors cannot save this film . true fans of austen will rush home to watch their dvds of the far superior 1995 bbc production with jennifer ehle and colin firth or to read austen ' s text in order to wipe this version from their minds .  let me say this about edward d . wood jr . he had a passion for his work that i wish more people did have . if we all had the optimism and the commanding hope of ed wood , the world would probably be a much better place . being familiar with ed wood ' s story and having seen the most wonderful biopic " ed wood " ( 1994 ) several times , i admire his boldness and his strives for the job he loved ; i still admire his never-say-die attitude . he had a love for directing that i wish more people in modern-day hollywood had . 

but that doesn ' t make his movies any more fun to watch . and " glen or glenda , " his first and most confessional film , is probably his very worst . 

 " glen or glenda " is a deadening cult movie about a cross-dresser named glen ( played by director / writer ed wood himself ) who despite his love for his fiancÃ©e barbara ( dolores fuller ) , cannot seem to conquer his lust for transvestitism , in which he dresses in women ' s clothing and a wig and thus becomes . . . glenda ! glen / glenda ' s story is narrated by a doctor and he too is talked and watched over by a mysterious character called " the scientist " played by veteran horror star bela lugosi . oh , and there ' s also some sub-story about an alan / anne character who becomes a transsexual based on the christine jorgenson story , upon whom this movie originally titled " i changed my sex ! " was previously to be based . 

have i dropped your jaw yet ? well , as much as i want to warn you off this picture if you ' ve never seen it , i would never tell a lie about a movie and there is not one word of falsehood in that plot synopsis i just gave you . every thing in it is true . this is a movie about cross-dressers and transsexuals , a topic that does not sound very appealing to begin with and is not done in a very appealing manner . i ' m sure that with a good screenplay , and a good director ( it had neither ) that " glen or glenda , " despite the subject matter , could have been a very moving picture . it is a confessional movie on wood ' s part , as he was a transvestite in real life as well as on screen . but once again , that does not make it a good movie . . . or a watchable one for that matter . " glen or glenda " is a jumbled , disorganized mess of a movie that sinks into new trenches in the realm of bad cinema . it makes no more sense than does its notoriously silly scene where bela lugosi screams " pull the string ! " over inexplicable footage of stampeding bison . the majority of the movie is narrated in a monotonous voice , reminding me of some very bad short informative films i ' ve seen before . it ' s like one of those really bad short films expanded into a seventy-minute feature and twice as dull . we sit there for ages waiting for the plot that never comes . there is no real attempt to even build energy with the camera being locked down in one position for many grueling minutes and long stretches of time where nothing at all happens . the only moments that are worth anybody ' s time are those of bela lugosi who manages to bring some light into these dark trenches . i guess lugosi is supposed to be like the deity of the film , but personally , i couldn ' t care less who or what he ' s supposed to be . i ' ll tell you what he was : a gifted actor who wound up making trash . but he and wood were very good friends and liked working with each other , so good for him . 

i will always admire edward d . wood jr . for his passion for the cinema , but i will never as long as i live admire his movies . a film critic once called ed wood ' s movies " innocent fun " but i think even that is questionable . innocent ? yes . fun ? no , sir . and if " citizen kane " is the mount everest of the cinematic world , then " glen or glenda " is probably the mariana trench .  some spoilers * * * * a soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it . when charlotte and veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful , low key , truly erotic scene . i also loved the music score and the soft , muted cinematography . i ' m not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form ( the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying ) . my biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life . of course , she has to be shown as a sexworker ( what else ) , scatterbrained , impractical , absurdly frilly / girly , completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world . moreover , she ' s always shown with two days growth of beard ( for some bizarre reason ) as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is . and she ' s waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning . in truth , the character resembles a drag queen , not someone in the midst of transitioning . 

these are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really aren ' t connected to transpeople . the film ' s fetishization of grs surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition . not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least . at the very least , why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender . . . i thought the male actor portraying veronica was okay but no better than that . much better was the woman portraying charlotte , a very complex character full of energy , self-loathing , desire and contradictions . if she was so fascinated by someone with female energy , a charlotte could go out to a women ' s bar in two seconds and find it . yes , she was drawn to veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with male / female characteristics ( a gentle touch but with a good punch ) , not as a unique person . yes , what a soap says about love is often lovely and moving , but that doesn ' t mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the process . 

this film also proves that danes are lousy dancers . for such a promising premise ( better executed in a film like " different for girls " ) the final film is a letdown .  this overheated southern gothic " mellerdramer " has a few decent moments --but is too often spoiled by a novice director piling clichÃ© upon clichÃ© , and a star who apparently decided to take it upon himself to turn the picture into his personal showcase , rather than allowing writer / director gabel to update inge or williams as a sort of contemporary " midnight cowboy " meets " lolita " tearjerker . 

close your eyes , listen to the exaggerated southern accents , and try to decide if you ' re witnessing a feature film , or an acting class -- full of eager amateurs . 

johansson is for once tolerable ( i . e . less pouty than usual ) -- though by no means good , macht is decent , though a little too pretty-boy cute to be believed , and travolta chews the scenery as never before ( with the help of a decent editor and some directorial restraint , his performance might have been really touching ; as it is , he -- and almost everyone else -- is too unlikable to ever move us past the point of boredom or revulsion ) . kara unger is perhaps best of all ; had her role been developed beyond a few lines , she might have even found herself with a best supporting actress nomination . 

pic is almost saved by leonard cohen-style growling theme song , decent production design and locations , and continual reference to literary works ( which has earned the otherwise standard screenplay reviews such as " poetic . " ) also helpful are a few old pros in the cast like sonny shroyer , and perhaps most importantly , soderbergh cameraman elliot davis -- whose fine work will no doubt be credited to the first-time director , who , ten or twenty years from now , may actually learn how to direct . 

but probably not .  peter yates film from the pen of steve tesich is a relatively low key " thriller " that doesn ' t really manage to get off the ground . story concerns the mysterious murder of an influential asian business man and the subsequent implication of a pathetic vietnam veteran ( james woods ) who , the police believe , may have taken revenge on his ex-employer . as the " eyewitness " , william hurt never believes his friend is capable of such an act . 

hurt is well below his usual strength , and one finds it hard to sympathise with him or an uninspired sigourney weaver . james woods and christopher plummer do a little better in their support roles . worth noting is the appearance of morgan freeman as detective black . 

in retrospect steve tesich ' s story is only an unlikely romance dressed up as a mystery flick . the plot is far too contrived . 

friday , october 17 , 1997 - video congratulations to christina ricci for making this movie and putting her mojo behind this important subject and trying to make a great film . ricci is my favorite actress : she is so gifted , so natural , her reactions are perfect and so is the energy she constantly radiates , which gives credence to the often misapplied term " star . " 

the film misses its mark for lots of various reasons , but perhaps most notably for the story ' s seeming unadaptability to the screen in making it a compelling narrative . . . more on that later . the cast at first glance is excellent , but come to think of it , jessica lang as the jewish mother is too protestant and not exactly right , ann hetch doesn ' t come close to showing the compassion and dedication of the psychiatrist from the book , and when your making a movie , how can you justify saying no to anne heche and jessica lange ? but the real problems are in the film ' s construction : first in the failure to elicit any kind of lasting sympathy for the elizabeth wurtzle character , and second to say anything meaningful regarding the all too common and horrible situation that this poor girl finds herself in . 

unfortunately do to the flashback construction , lizzy merely comes off as certainly more affected teenager than most , but not nearly as devastatingly ill as she comes off in the book . this is a major problem . this story had to be told from beginning to end and from the therapist ' s couch . she is only eight or nine when her depression starts due to devastating social factors , both society and the home , and this is a crucial point in not only eliciting the proper sympathy for her but also of the gravitas of her case . she is so talented , and such a vulnerable and disaffected spirit so early on , that one ' s heart can ' t help but reach out to her due to her victimization . this is missed on the film . 

ultimately one has to come to terms with what the film is trying to say : it is a biopic of one severely affected girl , but also it is a film about a nation who can ' t get its act together ; that is very clear in the book but interestingly not in the film where the chosen at harvard are even more messed up than the average college enrollee . the film finally isn ' t able to get either of these messages across compellingly , and that ' s too bad . is prozac a good thing or is it a bad thing , or a mixed blessing or a seeming necessity in a country in which so many people can ' t function without a chemical crutch ? these are tough and challenging concepts to work with and the writing does not really attempt to address any of them in a more or less engaging way . the challenger disaster is an interesting image to symbolize a dysfunctional america , but that doesn ' t have the effect it ' s suppose to have due to the crosscutting and insufficient earlier development of controlling themes . 

ricci ' s performance is tight and heartfelt , and one of the best of her acting career . 

michele williams is also superb in her role .  seven pioneer kids strive independently across many miles of indian territory and harsh weather to reach oregon . 

according to history , young ' uns who traveled by themselves through long distances of land - such as with the ' children ' s crusade ' - were manipulated and exploited by being abused and sold into slavery , but these kids are pretty tough and they try their best to prevail in accomplishing their goal of making a homestead out west . film is a little too syrupy at times , but ok for fans of ' the waltons ' and ' little house on the prairie ' . 

dean smith gives a cool performance as ' kit carson ' .  arthur miller has always been known as one of america ' s great playwrights for works such as " death of a salesman " and " the crucible " . " focus " is one of his lesser known plays brought to the silver screen . however , knowing what a great playwright arthur miller is , i doubt that his original play was very much like the movie . the movie comes across as empty and formulaic , with william h . macy as a non-jew mistaken for a jew by anti-semitic neighbors in wwii brooklyn . don ' t get me wrong : the acting is ok , and i presume that the people behind this movie were probably trying to make a point about racism , but the movie just doesn ' t work . macy , laura dern and david paymer just can ' t create an effective story with the material here .  in 1904 tangier , a wealthy american woman and her two children are kidnapped by berbers , murderous desert pirates who scorn the moroccan government and , by doing so , kidnap " american pestilence " , which attracts the attention of u . s . president theodore roosevelt . fictitious historical epic is less a grand adventure than it is a peculiar , somewhat exhaustive throwback to the desert-sheik films of the 1940s ( with a bit of " the king and i " interjected , besides ) . portraying the cloaked , mustachioed , bloodthirsty leader and his snippy , haughty captive , sean connery and candice bergen could be acting in two entirely different movies ( neither one seems to know how far to carry the camp-elements of their characters and dialogue , and both seem singularly without proper direction ) . the various ( and anonymous ) slashings and beheadings which occur are arbitrary : we don ' t know any of these victims , and the big action scenes become blurry , noisy montages of sand-swept violence on horseback . the pluses : a much-lauded music score by jerry goldsmith ( oscar-nominated , but a loser to john williams ' " jaws " ) , fine location shooting and cinematography . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  i watched the unrated version of this movie and as a person who has studied the life and crimes of speck closely , i must say this movie is a flawed but ambitious take on the real story . while capturing the true horror of speck and the murders this film makes the following factual errors . 1 . speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the movie . in fact he was mainly an alcoholic and pill popper who rarely took drugs via syringe . 2 . the asian nurse who survived speck ' s massacre did not squirm her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie . this would have been impossible . in real life she hid under a bed while speck methodically eliminated his 8 victims . 3 . the movie depicts speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them . not true . in reality speck was at first calm and gentle , reassuring the women he wasn ' t going to hurt them . this is how he was able to tie each of them up . 4 . the real richard speck was not the deep thinker the movie depicts him to be . fbi profiler robert ressler interviewed speck in the 80 ' s and said that speck not only did ' nt know why he committed the murders but that he wasn ' t interested in learning why nor could he shed any light on why . speck was known to be of below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this movie . if the story wasn ' t so tragic and horrifying , the voice over would be laughable . all in all , doug cole ' s performance is adequately menacing and cold-blooded even though i don ' t think the real speck was so forward in his violence . no doubt he was a very violent person when under the influence but he was also known , after all , for being a fairly slick con man who was able to put people at ease before victimizing them . beverly ann sotelo ' s performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the film . she is a very good actress . if you are at all squeamish , do not see this film . it ' s very graphic and disturbing .  based on a ray bradbury story ; a professional photographer ( brian kerwin ) returns to his modest home near a tiny desert town , where most of the citizens wishes he stayed away . a lonely boy ( jonathan carrasco ) latches onto him for the attention ; and the two witness the landing of an alien craft in the rocky region of the desert . the aliens turn themselves into the images of townspeople . kerwin must convince evacuation of the town and falls in love with the young boy ' s mother ( elizabeth pena ) . acting is pretty shallow ; the story line is no worse than some others ; this movie leaves you feeling that you got shorted on a decent ending . supporting cast includes : howard morris , dean norris and mickey jones .  andrÃ© roussin was a specialist of what the french call " theatre de boulevard " : plays where you find the eternal triangle : man / wife / ( male or female ) lover . many of his plays gave elvire popesco some of her best parts on stage . . . . and the great actress was the main reason to watch them , for roussin is not sacha guitry , by a long shot . the french audience remembers " au theatre ce soir ' . 

still with me ? roussin ' s plays were not made to be filmed . and this one is pretty mediocre material , even if the screenwriters call lewis carroll to their rescue . i like stewart granger and david niven , and ava gardner is eye candy . but this might be their worst film , being crude , predictable -even the native ' s ( bola -bola ) intervention is ludicrous- a knockabout farce around a menage Ã  trois on a desert island where granger would be some kind of robinson , niven , his friday and gardner his girl friday .  the ealing comedies constitute their own specific sub-genre in the history of film . they were wry , droll reflections on british life in the late forties and early fifties . they are always amusing but i feel it is misleading to characterise them as comedies . they are breezy and good-humoured , rather than laugh-out-loud funny . however , the best of them are laced with understated satire and shot through with an occasional dark streak ( epecially kind hearts and coronets and the ladykillers ) . 

i have an affection for all of them , but the lavender hill mob is probably the one i have most difficulty with . compared to the others , it seems somewhat perfunctory . to me , it is an outline sketch for a movie , but one that needed to spend a lot more time in development before it was ready to go before the cameras . 

everything about it is a bit undercooked . for example , nobody is given any real context or background . henry is simply a dutiful drudge , whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions go unrecognised , while albert is a frustrated artist forced to prostitute his talent by making gift shop trash for a living . this establishes a motive for their crime , but nothing that subsequently happens is a consequence either of their characters or their plan . 

other characters are introduced but play no real part in the story . the elderly resident in henry ' s guest house could ( with her love of detective stories ) have been made an unwitting thorn in his side , but is merely used as background ' colour ' . similarly , the various policemen who pop in and out of the action are simply there to keep the plot ticking along . 

as a result , the movie is driven entirely by its contrived plot devices , which i find both frustrating and faintly irritating . the not-very-ingenious robbery is accomplished with minimal problems , despite albert being prevented from carrying out his part in the plan ( by sidney tafler ' s clayton ) . the gold is then smuggled to france without mishap . everything would have gone smoothly if it wasn ' t for a minor hitch , lamely based on the french pronunciation of the letter ' r ' , which results in six of the gold eiffel towers being accidentally sold to some english schoolgirls . 

this leads to a series of frantic chases as henry and albert seek to retrieve them . these scenes are well executed , but at each point the conspirators are frustrated in their pursuit of the schoolgirls by a series of wholly factitious accidents . it is as if god is deliberately intervening to give them a hard time . this kind of plotting always has me grinding my teeth . 

when they finally track the last eiffel tower to a police academy exhibition and snatch it from under the nose of john gregson ' s police inspector ( why is he there , anyway ? ) all shreds of plot logic are abandoned . the final car chases are then simply filling up screen time until we are returned to the framing device with which the picture began . 

the movie doesn ' t even bother to tell us the fate of albert ( stanley holloway ) , lackery ( sid james ) and shorty ( alfie bass ) . 

this genial little caper has the professionalism of the ealing team behind it , so it is far from being a bad movie . i suspect most viewers will find it considerably more enjoyable than i do ( and why shouldn ' t they ? ) , but i cannot help thinking there was a much better movie waiting to be made , if only more time and effort had been expended on fleshing out both the characters and the story . 

by the standards established by ealing , lavender hill mob is a missed opportunity . 

ps : one curious footnote is that audrey hepburn gets a credit for her single line early on , but archie duncan remains anonymous despite his much more substantial contribution . i guess she just had a better agent .  it was only the second year of the academy but already they were voting politically - jeanne eagels ' brilliant performance in this creaky early talkie had to make do with an oscar nom and the statuette went to the worst performance ever to win - mary pickford ' s in coquette . the only existing print was a work print without music or final editing , but wherever it ' s shown , eagels stuns and captivates with her beguiling , powerful performance . she is so convincing on the witness stand that while we know she is lying through her teeth ( we did after all see her kill the man ) , we in the audience find ourselves , like the jurors , believing in her innocence , before we suddenly catch ourselves . that is great acting . the film needs to be made available on video so that the world can enjoy this terrific performance again . ( one silent of jeanne ' s exists in archive print - man , woman and sin - and her only other talkie , jealousy , is " lost , " so this is the only document we have of her . run to see it ( when it first came out of the archives to be shown in nyc in the early 70s , the village voice printed a full page review , worshipping the eagels performance ) .  the photography is accomplished , the acting is quite good , but in virtually every other department the greek tycoon is a dreary bore . taking its inspiration from the real-life love affair of jackie kennedy and aristotle onassis , the film is a glossy but absolutely empty soap opera of the kind that can be found on tv all day long . viewers who embrace the whole " celebrity magazine culture " ( paparazzi photographs and gossipy stories about the rich and famous ) will undoubtedly find much to whet their appetite here . but those who prefer films with a bit more substance and craft and quirkiness will find the 107 minute running time a butt-numbing slog . 

american president james cassidy ( james franciscus ) and his beautiful wife liz ( jacqueline bisset ) are in greece on official business . a ridiculously wealthy greek shipping tycoon , theo tomasis ( anthony quinn ) , catches sight of liz at a party at his elegant manor . despite the fact that both of them are married to someone else , there is an immediate attraction between them . later , at a private party aboard his yacht , tomasis makes his desires known to liz . some while later , president cassidy is assassinated whilst out strolling on a beach . liz is shocked and saddened by his death , but it isn ' t long before she seeks comfort in the arms of her greek lover tomasis . eventually the two of them are married and their love affair becomes a favourite talking point for the world ' s newspapers , magazines , photographers and wags . 

it is somewhat amusing to note the vigour with which the producers of this film denied that it was a dramatisation of the kennedy-onassis story . they wanted the film to be seen as an original story , rooted in fiction . but anyone with a brain can see from where the movie is drawing its inspiration . even aristotle onassis himself knew the greek tycoon amounted to his love-life getting the hollywood treatment ( if rumours are to be believed , he actually had a hand in approving anthony quinn for the tomasis role ! ) j . lee-thompson isn ' t really the right sort of director for this type of movie Â he ' s better suited to action fodder like the guns of navarone and ice cold in alex Â but he marshals the proceedings with an uninspired , professional adequacy . quinn is very watchable as tomasis ; bisset looks lovely as the object of his desires ; franciscus uses his toothy smile and a faÃ§ade of integrity to make for a believable politician . their performances are good on the surface , but there ' s little for the actors to do on any deeper level . similarly , tony richmond ' s photography gives the film an elegant surface sheen as it moves from one exotic locale to the next , but the merest of scratches proves that there ' s nothing behind the film ' s glossy exterior .  first of all , katherine hepburn is badly miscast as clara . she just can ' t be convincing as the devoted , selfless , rather smarmy wife that the writers have created . 

but the real weakness of the film is its shallowness in the face of a potentially great piece of drama . schumann ' s bipolar ( manic-depressive ) disorder amounts to " oh , oh , i have a headache " and the occasional angry word . suicide ? the word is used , but there ' s no sign of it in domestic scenes and when we see him in the mental hospital he ' s calm and subdued and smiling and optimistic . a superficial treatment . and brahms is so upright and bourgeois - no sign of his gruff humour , his love of tweaking the noses of the establishment , no sign of his tortured attitude toward sex and women resulting from spending his youth playing piano in brothels . and was clara ' s long concert career entirely about promoting robert ' s music , or was she , in fact , a remarkable pianist who wanted a career for herself , a female pianist carving out a place for herself in a male world ? any sort of treatment of the lives of great artists is better than none , but this is a standard hollywood , middle-of-the-road approach , particularly disappointing because the real story is so much more dramatic , so much more interesting , so much more human .  as a serious marathoner , i was seriously disappointed in this film . its target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon , or novice marathoners . following the stories of 2 first-time marathoners , one senior , one injured runner , and two elites as they prepare for the chicago marathon , the film dedicates the majority of its attention to one female beginner whose story is , for lack of a better word , boring . while i did enjoy the brief glimpses into the training sessions of deena kastor , the brief history of the boston marathon and marathoning in general , let me emphasize : these were brief ! ! watching some joe runners prepare for a saturday run with their water bottles and talking about how they view the marathon is not inspiring , and the nonstop clichÃ©s about achievement and feel-good grinning runners will make you wish the film were about an hour shorter . if you are a first-time marathoner , this film may give you a feeling of " i can do it . " for anyone else , run away .  the lifetime channel aired this in october but i only got around to watching it now . it ' s the old eternal triangle again Â small-town connecticut boy dave ford ( matt long ) has a quick fling with his best friend ' s girlfriend , emily darrow ( emmanuelle chriqui ) , on the eve of his departure for law school in new york , thinks about her for the next five years while he isn ' t doing contracts and briefs , runs into her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the eve of a big exam five years later , and gets involved with her romantically again . but director and co-writer matthew cole weiss goes way over the top , framing the whole thing in flashback as dave confesses to murdering emily , her husband and another one of her lovers in front of ( here comes the spoiler ) a lesbian cop who ' s also a flame of emily ' s . weiss overdoes the " flanging " effect by which dave gets to see chunks of his previous life flash before his eyes even before he ' s actually dead , cutting those in even while dave and emily are having sex and thereby ruining the soft-core porn shots that give even some otherwise pretty lame lifetime movies at least a bit of audience appeal . i couldn ' t help but flash back myself to james m . cain and how much better he wrote women like this in his classic thrillers ( all adapted into hit movies ) " the postman always rings twice , " " double indemnity " and " mildred pierce . " it also doesn ' t help that the film ends with the bad guys ( the bad girls , actually ) triumphant and the decent , if naÃ¯ve and stupid , hero seemingly on his way to the lethal injection table Â or that the actors playing the people dave and emily are cheating on are both better looking than they are . incidentally , though this film went straight to cable in the u . s . there were some blank spots on the soundtrack indicating where swear words were blipped , so i presume this got a theatrical release somewhere in the world .  maximum risk is quite surprising to a person that has seen more then on of his movies . director ringo lam made an average action-movie , that can be compared with most of the other mid-quality action movies , what is a special predicate to a `muscles from brussels`movie . it has a quite classy style , an interesting atmosphere and , last but not least , the beautyful natasha henstridge . even vandamme doesnÂ´t make you crying by his acting , he does a relatively good job . of course you may not compare maximum risk ( oh , what a creative title ! ) to `ronin` , but after watching `knock off` itÂ´s the hell of a good movie . . . in special standards , of course .  this is , arguably , the worst of the major ava gardner films . yes , she is gorgeous . but that can wear thin over time , especially after the corny and predictable movie ending . 

in this turkey , robert walker has to pretend that he ' s eddie bracken ( which surely embarrassed him ) . olga san juan plays the jane powell ( golly , gee ) part . dick haymes plays a sort of dim sidekick ( ! ) , and eve arden plays helen broderick ( and a host of other wise-cracking female semi-comedians ) . yes , the film contains a major popular song , " speak low . " but check out the other , entirely forgettable , pieces . dick haymes sings very well , of course , and so does the uncredited vocalist dubbing for ava . 

the sets are cheap , the script is filled with clichÃ©s and failed humor , and tom conway looks as though he has been battling with liquor ( as indeed he was ) . in short , if you want to see ava in her prime , buy a photo and stay well clear of this movie .  this formulaic film ( hero ' s girlfriend marries the villain ) just didn ' t move along fast enough given some of the circumstances of the story . scott seems too old in this one , and too many times his character turns away from decisive action , deflating the scenes . he responds to the deaths of some of his hands weakly ; he escapes from knox ' s gang by hiding in a full rain barrel ; his escape to the high country and pursuit by john russell seem superfluous , as does much of the film . the plot could have been tightened . 

high points of the film : seeing " tennessee " ernie ford without a mustache singing " man in the saddle " ; alfonso bedoya ' s too brief scenes as a cook ; the color photography of the high country , and the fight scene there with john russell .  as a native of new orleans , i can state that almost everything in this movie , from the atrocious n ' awlins dialect to the highly creative " manipulation " of crescent city geography , is horrible . this is another one of those big hollywood movies that decides to stereotype new orleans as : 1 . a city full of french-sounding idiots 2 . a city full of people who sound as if they ' ve just returned from blanche dubois ' summer home 3 . a city of drunkards , where every day is mardi gras 4 . a city of deep mystery , where almost everyone practices or is a victim of voodoo ( i admit that maybe we are a city of drunkards ; although every day is not mardi gras ) . " the big easy " is one of the worst films about new orleans . i wouldn ' t recommend it to anybody .  this movie has a look and feel of many " fresh " directors ( closeups and focus on the emotions being experienced by the actors ) . the point of the film was presented from many angles and expressed well by the relatively inexperienced cast . the point being " have faith in jesus christ and the morman church " oh , and if you read or hear anything contrary to the teachings of the prophet , it is just haterade . ( fuel for hatred )  everything this film tried to do is done better - and superbly in " run lola run " . the red haired hip cutie , the critical deadline ( s ) , the lover in jeopardy , and the " crime pays-sometimes " message . but , unlike " lola " , it just isn ' t believable or well put together . it is a labored knock off that might have worked for me if i had seen it before " lola " - but it pales in comparison . yes ! the falling beetle was nice ! but that was about the only surprise in the film . do yourself a favor and see the real mccoy - ( and the real hip red head ! ) - in run lola run !  a group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of a near world ending h-bomb blast . not only do they fear the radiation , but also mutants in the surrounding hillside . one of the group is already contaminated , but strangely poses no real threat to the others . just surviving the friction of assorted personalities at close range is the sub-plot . richard denning plays the hero . mike connors is close to the edge playing a tough guy . lori nelson is the girl destined to start populating a brave new world . not one of director roger corman ' s best . this is predictable black and white sci-fi .  what we know of caravaggio suggests a strutting brawler with a healthy sense of entitlement who lived amongst whores and thieves and hustlers and put them on canvas . his works ' themes were sex , death , redemption , above all , finding the sacred within the profane . he lived at a time where homosexuality carried a death sentence and political intrigue normally involved fatalities in a society defined by the maxim " strangling the boy for the purity of his scream " . 

you can ' t fault derek jarman for his cinematography , nor his recreations of caravaggio ' s paintings and you certainly can ' t accuse the man of shying away from the homosexuality . but frankly , jarman never strays beyond 80s caricature . italian patronage becomes the 80s london art scene complete with pretty waiters and calculators . sean bean is a sexy bit of northern rough oiling his motorbike . tilda swinton performs a transformation worthy of a mills and boons ( " why , miss lena , without that gypsy headscarf , you ' re beautiful . . . " ) . jarman provides caravaggio with a particularly trite motive for the murder which left him exiled . 

this could have been a visually stunning treatment of a man whose life was dangerous , exciting , violent and decadent but who nonetheless elevated the lives of ordinary people to the status of renaissance masterpieces , looked on by emperors and kings . instead , what you get is pierre et gilles do italy . the pretty bodies of young boys are shown to perfection , but never the men who inhabit them . jarman appears to satirise the london art scene , showing it shallow and pretentious . to use caravaggio and renaissance italy to make the point is to use a silk purse to make a pig ' s ear . in fairness , this film remains visually stunning , but ultimately as two dimensional as the paintings it describes .  why would burt lancaster allow himself to play a poor schnook who is ultimately undermined by femme fatale anna dundee , played by yvonne decarlo in ' criss cross ' ? the same reason why robert mitchum allows himself to be cast as another loser who falls for femme fatale faith domergue in the 1950 noir , " where danger lives " . perhaps they both felt it was a good way to show that they had ' range ' as actorsÂthat playing against type , the usual ' tough-guy ' role they were known for , would enhance their image as actors who could play any role . but the problem was that roles like steve thompson , the pathetic love-sick milquetoast in ' criss cross ' , did nothing to enhance lancaster ' s career . not only is lancaster completely miscast in the one-note role of thompson , but there ' s something inherently unlikeable ( and may i say , pathetic ) about the film ' s protagonist in the first place . 

 ' criss cross ' is an interminably slow-moving film . among the many unnecessary scenes in the film is at the beginning : the flashback which chronicles thompson ' s confrontation with dan duryea ' s dundee at the nightclub . everything that occurs in that initial flashback is explained later in the picture : the illicit affair between steve and anna , steve ' s strained relationship with martinez the cop and his bad blood with dundee . if director siodmark felt compelled to begin the film with a flashback , why not keep it under three minutes ? i think it would have been more effective . 

in ' criss cross ' , it takes quite awhile before the protagonist commits himself and steps out of the ' ordinary ' world of act one . that ' s the scene where he ' s " passing by ' and ' runs into ' anna at the nightclub . and notice how siodmak spends so much time cutting back and forth between anna dancing and steve staring at her ? in addition to the cross-cutting , he also spends a great deal of time focusing on esy morales and his rhumba band than moving the story along . 

up until the crisis of act two , the story plods along with thompson having various uneasy encounters with anna and then drowning his sorrows at his usual watering hole . at the midpoint of act two , he learns that anna has run off and gotten married to dundee . it ' s becoming more clear at this point that one of the film ' s central weaknesses is that dundee is never on screen throughout most of the second act . there are no confrontations between thompson and dundee during this time and we ' re left with the rather unexciting machinations between the two lovebirds . as it turns out ( and anna ' explains ' this later to steve ) , the reason why she left was not only because he disappeared for eight months but she also felt pressure from steve ' s mother as well direct threats from martinez the cop who implied that he would see to it that she ended up in the women ' s house of detention . anna goes back to steve because she realizes she made a big mistake with dundeeÂit turns out that he ' s been beating her and she ' s now scared of him . 

one of the silly refrains uttered by more than one character in criss cross is that you can never hijack an armored car . but everyone acts so surprised when steve points out it can be done if it ' s an ' inside job ' ! you would have thought that dundee would have known about steve ' s ' profession ' as an armored car driver and propositioned him beforehand . but of course steve needs to make the proposal so that dundee won ' t kill him after discovering his affair with anna ( if they ' re so afraid at getting caught , why do steve and anna meet at his apartment where dundee can so easily find them ? ) . i really got a kick out of finchley ( played by alan napier ) , the ' brains ' of the operation . dundee is so dumb that he has to hire this alcoholic ex-professor type who plots out the heist on a map . oh there is the matter of procuring the ingredients to construct the gas bombs used during the robbery and of course finchley is good at that too ! 

the only really well done scene in the entire film is the armored car robbery . the editing was quite good as it depicted the rising action of a heist gone bad . as the gas bombs go off , the brutality of the gang is shown in high relief when dundee murders the innocent armored car guard . 

the climax of the film is as drawn out as the rest of the film . why does it take so long for one of dundee ' s goons to kidnap thompson ? there ' s that nurse , then the goon is waiting outside , then he comes in and pretends that he ' s a friend , steve falls asleep and finally after he awakes , the goon kidnaps him . 

when steve finally meets up with anna at the house , we wonder how anna got her hands on the cash . did she somehow steal it from dundee after the heist when he went out to dinner ? it ' s never explained . even worse , anna suddenly becomes the evil femme fatale out of the blue . before , her selfishness and attraction to dundee can be explained by her perceived rejection at the hands of steve and martinez ' s threats . but after going back to steve because she fears dundee , she inexplicably turns on him when he is most vulnerable . just as there is ' instant coffee ' , you have ' instant femme fatale ' . 

in " film noirÂan encyclopedic reference to the american style " by silver and ward , the authors hail ' criss by cross ' as " one of the most tragic and compelling of film noir " . i beg to differ . in order to have tragedy you need characters that have great depth and in order to be compelling you need a story that ' s plausible . criss cross has neither . it ' s an overrated " b movie " that somehow has found itself in the pantheon of art house noirs . once again , the herd mentality has triumphed in evaluating the pictures of yesteryear .  i have to agree that the movie is not the best i ' ve ever seen , but i would like to make mention that the actors portraying tommy and jimmy dorsey were the actual dorsey brothers . as actors , they were wonderful musicians . the movie , based on their famous split , would have been better had professional actors played the parts . many movies made during this time frame took advantage of the popularity of big bands . most often , the movies were not that good because musicians are not actors by trade . most of the movie-going audience didn ' t go to see tommy or jimmy dorsey playing themselves ; they went for the plot and the music . i ' ve never been much of a dorsey fan , but the music is good even today . 

i have to comment on a previous post regarding the actors who played mom and pop dorsey and that their accents would be considered extreme by a dublin audience . arthur shields and sara allgood were actually irish actors , both born in dublin . you might remember mr . shields as the reverend mr . playfair in the quiet man and ms . allgood as mrs . monahan in cheaper by the dozen .  when i was young , i was a big fan of chuck norris . i just begun getting out all his old movies on video so i can see them through adult eyes . i remember that i really liked this one in particular , and thought it was one of his best . now that i ' m a little older , i can say that although it ' s thoroughly average , i still consider it one of his better films . in an acting stretch for him , norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie . serial killers are all the rage nowadays , and people would like to think of them as a wholly 90s invention . in contrast , it ' s good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from , most obviously , action movies ( as well as stalk n ' slashers ) of 70s and 80s . while norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are ham-fisted and laughable , nobody could kick someone in the head quite like chuck . being a big fan of steve james also , i can recommend this film , ditto for genre legend billy drago , as well as seeing mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role . not great , but it ' s better than anything norris did in the 90s .  how do i describe the horrors ? ! ! ! first , some points : first , this review should be taken with a grain of salt -- i saw this over 20 years ago , when i was a boy , at the museum of modern art in new york city . 

secondly , i am giving away some scenes and plot points . however , it does not have much of a plot . 

finally , i don ' t enjoy these type of art films anyway . 

this film was directed by proto-auteur luis bunuel . he was a surrealist and dadaist . these were modernist themes or movements popular critically in the 1920 ' s and early 1930 ' s . surealism was the school of art that made things hyper-real , yet often had freudian symbolism . dadaism is based on what is supposedly the first word made by an infant -- dada , or father . 

made in black and white , it was also made by a band of communists ( or as they preferred the term , socialists ) . bunuel and his group of fellow film-makers and artistes had been working on a number of symbolic ideas and issues in spain and france between the world wars . 

dadaism and surrealism influenced a lot of artists -- the police ( doo doo doo da ) , poet arthur rambaud , edvard munch ( the scream ) , rene magritte ( floating hats in space ) , salvador dali ( melting clocks ) , and even hitchcock ( psycho ) . no norman rockwell . 

here ' s what i recall most about this film : a girl meets up with a cow ; her eye gets slashed by a razor ; clownish men cavort in a meadow . there is not , as i said , much of a plot , but then again , that must be the point . 

this was attacked as porn back then , and would be again today . one of the trade-marks of surrealism is a significant anti-feminism .   " the james dean story " is introduced as " a different kind of motion picture , " explaining , " the presence of the leading character in this film has been made possible by the use of existing motion picture material , tape recordings of his voice and by means of a new technique - dynamic exploration of the still photograph . " the only " tape recordings of his voice " noteworthy is one short recording mr . dean make while visiting his family in indiana ; he wanted to record any family recollections of his great-grandfather cal dean , intrigued because he played a similarly named " cal " in " east of eden " . dean asks if cal dean was interested in art , and learns the relative was an auctioneer . james dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family , obviously . that ' s the only 100 % accurate revelation in this documentary . james dean was interested in art and had warm relationship with his family . 

an amazing " screen test " / " outtake " from " east of eden " appears near the film ' s end . it ' s a black and white scene between dean ( as cal trask ) and co-star richard davalos ( as aron trask ) . dean is at his mesmerizing best . if this scene appeared only here , and no " east of eden " film was completed , this documentary would be an essential , high rated film . but the scene , a perfect " 10 " in isolation , should be considered an " east of eden " extra . dean ' s " traffic safety film " is also worth seeing . 

there are the expected interviews with family and friends . my favorites were the guy ( lew bracker ) going through a box of stuff dean left with him , and dean ' s family . there wasn ' t enough from aunt ortense and the letter from dean to his little cousin was very nice . more reading of dean ' s letters would have been welcome . dean ' s unidentified writer friend seemed to have a better thesis for the film ; filmmakers might have considered developing it as a main focus . 

robert altman ' s direction of martin gabel ' s reading of stewart stern ' s script is dreadful . what were they thinking ? perhaps , filmmakers can be forgiven due to the closeness of dean ' s passing . don ' t expect " the james dean story " at all . this movie is more about dean ' s effect on people ( both the fans and filmmakers ) than the man . it is very clearly an early piece of the james dean myth-making " legend " . tommy sands sings " let me be loved " . the narrative refers to dean as " he " with a god-like air . the shots of dean ' s family seeming to " know " the moment he dies are truly wretched . 

 * * the james dean story ( 8 / 13 / 57 ) robert altman ~ james dean , martin gabel , richard davalos charlie chaplin responds to open auditions at lodestone studios . rival ben turpin arrives at the same studio , obviously another unemployed comedian ! turpin tries to horn in on chaplin ' s action after the studio head hollers , " next ! " chaplin manages to walk in over turpin , however . charlie amusingly manages to botch jobs as an actor and carpenter . in the end , he manages to get a big break , but will a star be born ? 

there are a lot of jokes involving the buttocks . the initial scene involving slapstick from chaplin and turpin is a relative highlight . note that gloria swanson is the typist in the far background left on your screen , in the film ' s opening . agnes ayres also appears . 

 * * * his new job ( 2 / 1 / 15 ) charles chaplin ~ charlie chaplin , ben turpin , charlotte mineau i have recently found this film on one of my husband ' s vhs tapes ( the blank variety which he uses to record stuff from the telly ) . the film looks as if it was last shown in the eighties and i don ' t remember having seen it since . it has not ( to my knowledge ) been released on dvd or vhs although i shall browse around for a copy . 

the film tells the story of three young people : two girls , one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger , and a young boy who go to live with their mother ' s brother and his young , mute irish wife . his wife also has two brothers who live with them . the children ' s uncle is an unpleasant control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar whilst she watches a marionette show put on by him and her brothers in his toyshop . 

the eldest girl and one of the irishmen ( the younger ) develop a love for each other whilst they live in the same house . the girl helps her aunt out in the shop whilst her brother helps his uncle to make things in the workshop . 

there are a lot of very disturbing elements to the film . there is the uncle ' s treatment of his wife as some kind of dumb ( literally ) possession ( illustrated by the collar ) whilst the irish indulge dancing , drinking and somewhat forbidden love . interestingly , though , i have seen far more explicit themes played out in other movies made in hollywood today . 

makes you wonder whether the british film industry and the bbc have some kind of hidden agenda going on . 

still , despite it not being a children ' s movie , there are a lot of playful , magic moments in it and the one irishman does some beautiful paintings .  prey

a lesbian couple ( sally faulkner and glory annan ) living in a remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of a young man ( barry stokes ) who turns out to be a flesh-eating alien , the vanguard of a massive invasion . . . 

despite its shoestring budget and leaden pacing , norman j . warren ' s follow-up to satan ' s slave ( 1976 ) amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its meager parts , thanks to a surprisingly complex script by max cuff ( apparently , his only writing credit ) : faulkner and annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the english countryside ( rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by derek v . browne ' s eye-catching cinematography ) , though annan ' s discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one ( or both ) of these doe-eyed lovelies as psychologically disturbed , which may explain the absence of their respective families , some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and ' left ' under mysterious circumstances . stokes ' unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray , partly because faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because annan is attracted to him , creating tensions which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence . there ' s an extraordinary , multi-layered sequence in which faulkner attempts to ' emasculate ' their clueless visitor by dressing him in women ' s clothing , though stokes ' alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery . 

in the early scenes , at least , the relationship between faulkner and annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity , but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowd-pleasing episodes of sex and pulchritude , culminating in an explosion of horror when annan allows herself to be ravished by stokes following a violent argument with faulkner . the closing sequences are ( quite literally ) gut-wrenching , especially annan ' s final scene , which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in 1977 and never fully restored ( what remains is still pretty vivid , so brace yourselves ! ) . excellent performances by the three leads , bolstered by warren ' s unobtrusive direction , which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations , thereby compensating for the film ' s budgetary shortcomings . originally released in the us as alien prey .  director and playwright richard day adapted his own stage material for the screen , clearly inspired by rock hudson ' s real-life dilemma from the 1950s : what to do with a screen idol who is secretly homosexual ? marry him off to an unsuspecting woman in order to quell the gossips ( and keep him working ) . wispy-thin idea given some energy by the good cast and retro production design which amusingly resembles a greeting card by shag . the dialogue isn ' t very clever , and there ' s some slapstick goofing around near the beginning which fails to work ( spitting out food , etc . ) . still , when a serious tone comes over the final act , it is handled with great taste--and is far more welcomed by the viewer than all the klutzy silliness . matt letscher does good work as movie hero / male whore guy stone , but are his experiences here enough to strengthen his character , or would he be right back at the bar the next night ? the movie seems not to know--or care . day wants to get off a few one-liners and one carefully written pro-gay speech--a plea for tolerance--but he has no other agenda . for audiences who invest their time and interest in these people , the sentimental bow on this thing can look like nothing more than a prank . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  spiderman was one of the first comic books to initiate a change in the genre : in spite of being a very well made superhero comic book this is the first series ever that added a real psychological depth to the main character , had complex moral issue , round characters and also highlighted social and political issues . in other words : spiderman was the comic book ' s coming of age . this tv series lacks all of those components . it ' s just a straightforward good buy / bad guy tv series suffering from obvious budgetary rerstraints that make the action scene moderately exciting . spiderman nylon webbing is about as convincing as the cardboard rocks in star trek . nicholas hammond is way too old for the role at that point in time . i think he was well into his thirties wheras spider , man was really teenager at the time . for some unfathomable reason the writers also changed names and deleted important characters from the comic book which again just resulted in the tension between characters basically disappearing .  shot in my former home town by a couple of college kids , this movie centers around some freak named " luther " . luther , recently paroled ( revealed to us by an arguing parole board in one of the most laughably scenes of all time ) , runs amuck at the local kroger grocery by eating an old woman ' s neck with his metal teeth . 

luther runs to farm where he eats a guy , steals a car , ties up an old woman , and gets chased , and gets killed . oh , and the chick from the superboy tv show gets naked .  the creative team behind evan almighty really should have been able to make a better film . starring one of america ' s favourite funnymen and helmed by ace ventura pet detective director tom shadyac one expects a higher laugh count than the picture provides . hell even steve oedekerk who wrote and directed last years atrocious barnyard , and attains a writing credit here has done better work . the fact of the matter is that evan almighty isn ' t the worst picture of the summer season but it might well be the most disappointing . the title and creative team behind the picture suggest this is a sequel of sorts to 2003 ' s bruce almighty . that picture had jim carrey in the lead , and whilst both steve carell and carrey are both funny guys it ' s the latter who ' s better suited to this sort of material . i ' ve heard that carrey was offered this sequel before anyone else , but the actor declined staing he saw no other places for his character to venture . thus shadyac moved over to carell , who ever since an amusing bit part in the 2003 original has been gunning for stardom . after sleeper hits the 40 year old virgin and little miss sunshine the man has become big business , and so it ' s him rather than rubber faced jim who leads this production into theatres . the story see ' s evan baxter ( steve carell ) having been elected as a congressman and thus he and his troop move house and state so evan can find success with his job . his wife ( lauren graham ) and three kids have doubts but overall show a supportive side towards evan , who himself looks at the future with optimistic eyes . however things start to go belly up fairly fast , god ( morgan freeman ) appears to evan stating a flood is coming and that the politician must build an ark . initially ignoring the encounter , evan is quickly granted some robes a beard that refuses to stay shaved and animals are beginning to appear two by two . evan then begins to put the boat into construction but the neighbourhood aren ' t happy and neither is a fellow politician ( john goodman ) . anyone expecting the wacky laughs of some of tom shadyac ' s other films will probably be left completely cold by this movie . ace ventura , liar liar and hell even bruce almighty where largely very funny pictures , but all of those ; projects have one thing in commen and thats jim carrey ' s presence . shadyac hasn ' t made a worthwhile film without carrey at the helm , he ' s worked with robin williams , eddie murphy and now steve carell , but still only carrey seems to meld successfully with shadyac . carell after the disappointing box-office and critical mauling won ' t be desperate to work with the director again , and with carrey now doing more serious projects shadyac had better find a new comic muse fast . carell himself is fairly dull here , whoever felt that his bit part in the first movie ( despite being quite amusing ) deserved a full length feature should be taken out back and shot . i expect after bruce almighty ' s box-office draw it was universal studios themselves , but you know when a quality comedian can ' t do anything with a character then the scren persona is a dud , and thats exactly the case with evan almighty . lauren graham isn ' t any great shakes as evan ' s wife nor do any of the children strike the right note . freeman lets it all hang loose as god in another amusing and chilled performance but he appears to sporadically to carry the piece . indeed the most consistent source of laughter is evan ' s secretary ( wanda sykes ) and creep co-worker ( jonah hill ) , both made me laugh twice as much as any other character in the project . oedekerk ' s writing has been worse ( barnyard ) but also better ( ace ventura when nature calls ) than his work on this production . his script does have genuinely funny moments but it ' s also full of cloying family moments and the humour is never weird or indeed offensive enough . the film takes tame and easy swipes at religion when it ought to rip the concept to shreds , indeed the opening church sequence in the simpsons movie shakes religion harder than evan almighty ' s whole 95 minute run . with a bit more daring and heart this could have been a far better picture . i don ' t doubt that the core family audience will be mildly entertained by this film , but if they ' ll be satisfied is a completely different question . there ' s a line between being watchable and being worthwhile , a line that evan almighty is always on the wrong side off . maybe when you ' re feeling bored and the films on cable you can afford to watch , but i can think of plenty better ways to spend my time and indeed more importantly my money than tuning into this mediocre comedy .  worse than mediocre thriller about an abused wife who goes on the lam after she is linked circumstantially to the death of her husband and sister . determined to prove that her husband is alive she follows leads across the state , her peril increasing at each stop . chasing after her are the traditional ' good-cop ' and ' bad-cop ' pair of partners . one is convinced of her innocence the other more interested in closing the case and getting home . this pair is often able to corner their suspect but never quite to capture her . all the main players meet up in a remote town in the desert and the truth begins to unfold with deadly consequences for some . 

wow ! this was a bad movie . the lead acted as if she was tranquilized , the cops couldn ' t find a suspect if he or she is in the police station ( this happens twice ) and everyone else is as one-dimensional as can be . avoid this one at all costs . 

 ahem . . i think i ' ll be the only one who ' s saying this but yes , i was a lil bored during the film . not to say that this is a bad movie , in fact it ' s a very good attempt at portraying the innermost emotions - dilemma , sorrow , love . . , esp it ' s the director ' s debut ( read from somewhere , is it true ? ) . i felt that something ' s not quite right , maybe it ' s just me , i ' m not drawn to the characters enough to immerse me in their world . this is a simple story , about ordinary people , ordinary lives . through simple and short dialogs , the director tries to relate a simple guy ' s life , and how copes with the news of his illness by laughing it away every time . oh ya his laughter was kinda cute at first but gradually it gets to me , such a deep hearty roar for a gentle man ! i must say , i didn ' t feel the impact that most readers felt , in fact i was more drawn to the trivial scenarios like spitting of watermelon seeds with his sis that clearly shows that they ' re comfortable with each other , the granny who came back for another shot - this is kinda melancholic , the thoughtful gesture of writing down the procedures for his dad - hmm but this is predictable . . don ' t misunderstood that i ' m an action-lover , independent films are my cup of tea ! perhaps i just have a really high expectation after watching many deep films that have stronger imagery . some asian films worth the watch : 

tony takitani ( depicts loneliness ) wayward cloud ( only 1 dialog ) my sassy girl ( i like it ! ) 4 . 30 ( loneliness as well ) 15 ( gangsters lives in local setting ) before sunrise and before sunset ( i just have to mention these even though they are not asian films . fans will understand ! )  oh dear ! the bbc is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one . i agree this novel of jane austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience , the heroine is hardly a elizabeth bennet , even edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat . however i must say i was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed . the basic story was preserved , but the dialogue was so altered that all that was jane austen ' s tone , manner , feeling , wit , depth , was diluted if not lost . if some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern ( ' his life is one long party ' ? ? ? ? ? ) the cast was generally adequate , but i think billie piper was the wrong choice , it needed someone more restrained , i gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a submissive exterior , she was more like a frolicking child . i see i must wait for the bbc to weave its magic once again .  let me first start with the obvious : antisemitism has been a serious problem throughout history , present in many societies and causing the deaths of million of jews . that said , the problem with this movie is that it views the united states - probably the most welcoming society ever to jews outside of israel - as a not very different place from nazi germany . set in 1943 , the movie is about a man ( william h . macy ) who gets confused with a jew after he starts wearing glasses ! . a number of very nasty things happen to him after that ( he loses his job and he is unable to find a new one , his neighbors shunned him , all ending up in a violent confrontation ) . from one of arthur miller ' s self pitying , patronizing novels , the sort that gave liberalism a bad name .  three young college women , simona ( iva krajnc ) , alja ( tanja potocnik ) , and zana ( pia zemljic ) , go on an adventure canoing down the river kolpa , dividing their slovenia from neighboring croatia , in this 2002 slovenian film by maya weiss . what could have been an eastern european version of the well-known and exciting 1972 " deliverance " turned out , for me , to be utterly uninspiring with flat character portrayals that denied sympathetic identification with the characters . 

alja and zana are not convincing as students at all , though alja expresses a desire to be a writer , and both use what seemed to me to be excessive bad language . alja is bored with her boyfriend and seems to just be drifting along in life . zana , even less scholarly , is a self-absorbed adventure seeker with an attraction to other women . i had some sympathy with relatively innocent simona , conservative and starry eyed . the very idea of these three traveling together just doesn ' t work for me . the disdain that zana and alja show toward simona makes no sense - why would they choose her as a travel companion to start with as surely they must know her demeanor and attitudes ? 

the three begin a carefree journey down the river on two canoes , undeterred by a news story of a woman ' s disappearance along the river . things become more somber with the mysterious appearance , sometimes real and sometimes possibly hallucinatory , of a rabidly conservative fisherman politician ( jonas znidarsic ) . 

i did enjoy the scenes along the river and of small villages the trio visit . it may be because of a lack of cultural understanding , but the film didn ' t move me otherwise . i was surprised to see that the film has won some awards .  dreadful film about a doctor who goes fishing and winds up catching a mermaid when he is thrown overboard . she traps him into bringing her back with him . 

glynis johns , in the title role , is really a silly individual with a tail hanging out . 

margaret rutherford is the nurse who is supposed to be so eccentric but we see no eccentricity here . in fact , miss rutherford was not allowed to use her true comedic gifts . 

nice to see david tomlinson in the film . he would get together with johns in the far superior " mary poppins , " 16 years later . 

miranda causes mischief in that two guys , a neighbor ' s fiancÃ©e and chauffeur ( tomlinson ) fall for her . 

ask any mermaid you happen to see , what ' s the best tuna , chicken of the sea ! as for this film , forget it .  the director spent a lot of time making the scenes look real right down to the historical photos and all the sounds of the old west bustle . too bad the producers and writer / director , michael cimino , spent zero time on any of the historical facts of what the johnson county war was really about . a lot of the war was over how public lands should be used for grazing . the cattlemen didn ' t want the poor sheep herders on the land to compete for forage on this cold , windswept plateau . the entire epic makes no mention of grazing sheep which was one of the most important reasons for the war . 

the worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers . the peasants are shown circling the gunmen like a bunch of indians would do in much earlier hollywood movies . the true fact is that johnson county sheriff william ( red ) angus , with a posse of 200 to 300 men , intercepted the gunmen and trapped them in a barn at the ta ranch . i doubt any women took part in the siege . 

ellen ( ella also known as cattle kate ) watson and her second husband , james averell , were hanged by a lynch mob about three years before the johnson county invasion . ella was never a prostitute . this was a canard spread by the wyoming stock growers association ( wsga ) in order to discredit her . the fact that the plot makes her out to be a brothel madam only serves the interests of the wsga . 

i object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is so obviously fiction . there is no fact in the events , time lines , or backgrounds of the characters . why michael cimino would use real names of people who were loosely connected with the johnson county war ( and events leading up to it ) is beyond me . 

the movie could have been much more interesting if it had dwelt on the political ramifications of the federal government intervention in a state government ' s affairs and what happened after the wsga gunmen were saved by the calvary . some effort was made to prosecute the cattlemen who were responsible by the johnson county attorney . but since johnson county could not afford the court costs and the governor of wyoming , amos w . barber , backed the wsga , the charges were eventually dropped . 

overall i think the movie was just an excuse to show isabelle huppert naked for much of the three and 3 / 4 hours of running time on the dvd version .  a ruthless assassin has been hired to eliminate someone at the very top of the u . s . government . constantly changing his identity and location , he is known only as the jackal . everything about this hit man is a secret . aware of the jackal ' s presence but uncertain of his purpose , the fbi ' s deputy director faces the biggest challenge of his career . in order to track down this cold-blooded killer , he and a by-the-book russian intelligence officer enlist the aid of an imprisoned irish terrorist . these unlikely allies enter a global race against the clock to stop the mysterious mercenary before he can complete his assignment . if you are looking for a non-stop action movie like die hard , then the jackal is not your movie . itÂ´s a slow spy thriller with many cool gadgets and weapons . richard gere does a good job playing an impassioned terrorist who is helping the fbi for a deeper cause than just freedom . and willis puts forth a good effort as the jackal . ok film but nothing more .  while it would be easy and accurate to go into why ' reba ' is at its heart indicative of many ' family-oriented sitcoms ' in the way it rips off from other better sitcoms , the real truth is that the show is repetitive , full of stereotypes from funnier and more groundbreaking shows , and the lead star is completely out of her element . while i ' m sure ms . mcintire can sing and has a fan base that supports that , being in a sitcom shooting out zingers and calling her the next lucille ball is far , far removed from reality . 

reba herself has no presence which is needed here to establish the fact that she is cast as the put-upon woman of which her entire family is centered . yet after watching a few episodes there is no real connection to the character . i could care less about her adventures because her whole character seems to be mia . reba mcintire has no screen presence , and to make a show around her seems very short-sighted and indicative of most ' family-oriented ' programming : to push a sitcom full of men-stupid / women-do-everything stereotypes that appeal to nobody but those who can ' t afford cable . 

the show is a waste of time . the only good thing is that it at least has better production values than your standard pax ripoff . . . . just .  this is a silly movie with much singing and dancing . acting is average , but writing leaves something to be desired . there are rememberable performances by buddy epsen , with a short but outstanding performance by gypsy rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy . a totally unbelievable portrayal of college life which ends with a superb ice skating exibition of alice in wonderland . many parts are worth watching , but do not be afraid to fast forward through parts of the movie  " the wizard of menlo park " was deeply responsible for many things we take for granted in 2007 : even if he did not invent them without rivals or assistants , he gave birth to the electric light , the phonograph , the motion picture camera , the electric car battery , the electric power grid ( possibly his most important but least recalled invention ) , the pre-fabricated house , and innovations to the telephone and telegraph , as well as the ticker-tape machine and an early voting machine . the total number of patents is over 1 , 000 - far more than any other american inventor . 

but edison was a ruthless business competitor . he frequently had vast legal fights over the precedence of his inventions over rivals . the best example is the telephone , where he was one of seven or eight rivals with claims against alexander graham bell . actually edison ' s invention here was not the central idea that bell and gray had come up with independently of each other in 1876 , but an improvement on the sound quality of the phone receiver and transmitter that bell did not develop . still it was part of the huge 1888 supreme court decision that was the longest u . s . supreme court decision ( a single volume of their reports ! ) written by chief justice morrison waite - which , by the way , killed the poor chief justice from overwork within weeks of completing it . 

in 1886 edison found an equally ruthless competitor in the area of electric power grids for large cities . this was george westinghouse , inventor of the railroad air break . westinghouse ' s firm had gotten the assistance of a new inventor , and former edison assistant , nicola tesla . tesla developed " alternating current " , which was a rival system to edison ' s " direct current " . edison ' s system was basically a straight circuit system of electricity . tesla ' s system allowed the current to be switched from one circuit to another - actually it was a better , and more efficient system . but edison was determined to break this rival by a publicity campaign . 

it started with electric power lines . edison early on had his lines put underground , so that they would not be endangered by weather conditions . but westinghouse was forced to have his lines out in the open - like telephone lines . when there were several accidental deaths by repair linemen on westinghouse ' s lines ( in particular one incident where the repairman was burned alive in front of hundreds of horrified onlookers in manhattan ' s business district ) , edison started insisting that a . c . current was far more dangerous that d . c . 

one result of all this was edison helping some subsidiary inventors with getting westinghouse a . c . generators and dynamos for an electric chair . edison himself always denied that he invented the electric chair , but he helped several lesser figures along the way - for the complete story read mark essig ' s edison & the electric chair ( new york : walker & company , 2003 ) . 

edison experiment himself with cats and dogs ( experiments he was glad to show the public ) . in the long run , despite assisting in the invention of a new method of execution , edison failed to dislodge the public support of alternating current . but he never stopped trying . 

in 1903 he had an opportunity to combine his campaign against westinghouse and a . c . with his invention of the motion picture camera . he assisted in " putting down " a well known public elephant ( " topsy " ) who had killed several men . he did so by electrocuting the poor beast with a . c . but the entire killing is on film - and one can view it to this day . it is a pitiful looking film - whatever poor " topsy " had done it was a poor beast - not a machiavellian murderer . the moment we see the explosions of electricity sparks that show the death of the elephant , we are aware it will soon be over , but the sudden collapse of " topsy " is still an unpleasant sight to view . the film leaves a bad flavor in the mouths of modern movie audiences . yet , sad to say , it probably made a profit for edison - his description of the film in his catalog of films shows real pride in his accomplishment here . in 1903 it may have been exciting entertainment for many americans watching it . one is glad that more people are appalled by it today - sometimes one can sense the human race has improved a little bit .  my wife and i met doing a professional production of " the merry widow " in 1982 -- in english , but a straight translation . 

only the very basic skeleton of the original plot is visible in this " adaptation " . most of the characters have been deleted , along with the entire b plot , and all but one of the characters remaining have been renamed . most of the characters in the movie aren ' t in the operetta , either . the action has been moved from paris to , at first , washington , dc , and then to the fictional country of pontevedro , which the movie has renamed " marshovia " , and only later to paris . the net result is that we don ' t reach the beginning of the original play until about 45 minutes in . 

and the main source of tension in the plot is deleted , too . in the original , years before , count danilo and the heroine were very much in love , but his family refused to allow them to marry because she was poor ; it ' s his broken heart that has rendered him a careless playboy . now that , as a widow , she ' s the richest woman in the world , she still loves him , and he still loves her , but his pride won ' t let him admit it to anyone , even himself , and she must spend three acts playing mind games to break him down . the trope of the aristocrat with money problems who won ' t admit that he ' s in love with a rich woman for fear of what people will think supplied the main plots of a substantial fraction of viennese operettas for decades after the 1906 " widow " . in this movie , they ' ve never met before , which rips out not only the heart of the whole thing , but nearly all the comedy . 

lamas does a pretty decent job , though . 

an interesting musical point is that several times we hear a snippet or so of " trÃ©s parisien " , an extra song written ( in english , despite the title ) for the london premiÃ¨re , which was not , as far as i know , usually found in american productions until the 1980s or so .  i saw this film shortly after watching moonlight & valentino with elizabeth perkins , gwyneth platrow , whoopi goldberg and kathleen turner . there are a lot of similarities between the two films . they both have great casts and good acting . they both have stock characters of sisters who are very different , an offensive stepmother , a woman friend / confidant , an emotionally unavailable father , a dead mother and a surprise lover . both films have the characters experience life-changing realizations and both films suffer from a kind of ' love conquers all ' sentimentality . they both add a little titillation with cameron diaz in black underwear and a partial back shot of gwyneth paltrow naked . 

both films seem contrived , as if the writers of the works the films are based on did market research and said , " ok , there ' s a market for stories about relationships between women , so i ' m going to write about two sisters with an offensive stepmother " in other words , instead of the drama emerging from the truth of the relationship , the relationship is invented to fit the dramatic situation . it seems forced , the characters don ' t seem real , the relationships are unbelievable . 

the resolution of the tensions between the characters is simplistic with simple apologies completely whisking away years of acrimony leaving everyone feeling warm and fuzzy ever after . it ' s just not real . romantic fantasy . 

the characters in in her shoes are a little more overblown than moonlight & valentino , especially the stepmother part . sydelle feller is so evil that it is difficult to believe that the father would stay with her , or even marry her in the first place . 

if you liked moonlight & valentino you will probably like in her shoes as well . enjoyable performances in both , in fact , the actors bring depth to their parts that goes way beyond the contrived sentimentality of the scripts .  a plot that is dumb beyond belief . however , that said , it must be admitted the lead actors go at their roles as though it were shakespeare . and that is as it should be . it isn ' t their fault the writer seems to be in a coma . 

hats off to what is really a very cunning performance by joanna kerns . she proves that just because it isn ' t on the page doesn ' t mean a role can ' t be seized and dug into . and she does so with gusto . good for her . 

ditto to christine elise who is called upon to be little more than confused and weepy , but goes way beyond what is asked of her by the script . 

and to grant show as well . a graduate of daytime and prime time soaps ( ryan ' s hope , melrose place ) . he is always versatile and underrated . his primary drawback seems to be his impossible-to-ignore good looks . he is a sturdy , well grounded actor capable of much more than he is generally given the opportunity to do . 

the rest of the cast is basically window dressing . 

the direction is adequate and the script , as i alluded to , is fairly idiotic . 

watch this one to enjoy three good actors in the leads taking delight in performing some much needed scenery chewing . it ' s fun .  the odd mixture of comedy and horror sometimes works and sometimes doesn ' t . had the main male character been a little more interesting , the film would have been as well . a trio of young americans visit paris , run into a beautiful werewolf , and the problems confound from there . 

numerous logic holes make the possibly intriguing story difficult to take .  

i was fascinated to read the range of opinions on `circus ' from `awesome , breathtaking , brilliant ' and most things between right down to `golden turkey candidate ' . i find myself in the latter camp . 

the producers obviously thought that if they mixed plenty of over-the-top violence with barrages of four-letter expletives they ' d have another `lock , stock and two smoking barrels ' on their hands . a pity that they forgot to include wit , style , charm and flair . and it was certainly a mistake to feature a visit to welles ' classic `the lady from shanghai ' thus serving to remind us how much better cinema can be . 

john hannah gets his shirt off at every opportunity , a huge american drives around in a mini minor as `circus ' pathetically strains for cult status and even the beautiful amanda donohoe can ' t add any class to these proceedings . 

if you want to see a good brit film try the sublime `wonderland '  during an eight-year stretch of the 1980s when charles bronson made nine films , only one was released by a company other than the cannon group : ' the evil that men do , ' a tristar films pickup from sir lew grade ' s itc entertainment firm . bronson was already in the thick of his collaborations with director j . lee thompson , which ran through numerous actioners until ' kinjite : forbidden subjects ' in 1989 . 

expectations should run pretty high with bronson and thompson working for a better-funded outfit like itc , but ' the evil that man do ' is a great disappointment on many levels . while still from the low budget , b-movie mold of the 1980s , ' evil ' has tantalizing potential for a great film . everyone in the production department , however , took an easy way out and sold hack work undeserving of bronson ' s imprint . ' the evil that men do ' had a concept and technical resources that could have been used to make one of bronson and thompson ' s best films , but instead will go down as one of their most average . 

this 1984 political thriller / actioner opens in brutal fashion with clement molloch ( joseph maher ) , a british doctor , holding his special training class for political leaders in surinam . the gray-haired , passive molloch is an expert on torture methods who is employed by numerous political regimes . in the opening seven minutes , we witness molloch using electrical current to inflict unbearable pain on jorge hidalgo ( jorge humberto robles ) , a dissident journalist . as you may expect , the scene is awful to watch and was cut from the original vhs release . 

hidalgo was none other than a friend of holland ( bronson ) , a retired assassin who is enjoying life in the cayman islands . holland was approached by the journalist years before to rid humanity of molloch , but turned the offer down . a mexican professor named hector lomelin ( josÃ© ferrer ) visits shortly after hidalgo ' s death to talk holland into finishing the job , bringing videotapes of testimony from the doctor ' s victims . while in denial at first , holland eventually agrees to the dirty work , targeting molloch and his doting sister claire ( antoinette bower ) in guatemala . 

holland enters guatemala city with help from an adviser , max ortiz ( renÃ© enrÃ­quez ) ; he poses as a tourist with hidalgo ' s widow rhiana ( theresa saldana ) and young daughter sarah ( amanda nicole thomas ) in tow . as with most of bronson ' s later output , his character knocks off molloch ' s henchmen one by one , crossing paths with a sleazy american diplomat ( john glover ) and his supporting hit-man ( roger cudney ) along the way . a brutal ending takes place in the crevices of an opal mine , where the doctor gets just deserts from several of his victims . 

 ' the evil that men do ' is based on a forgotten novel by r . lance hill and jumps at american political dealings in latin america during the 1980s . indeed , ' evil ' is hard-boiled in every sense of the term , as it uses sensationalism and doses of brutality to cover up huge weaknesses in plot and character development . for every plus this film has , there are three or four minuses , resulting from shod craftsmanship . 

while ' the evil that men do ' has a great concept , the film is never truly more than an excuse for bronson to wipe out foreign-based scum . in the style of bad pulp fiction , ' evil ' is filled with cardboard characters that we never get to know or understand . holland , despite being played strongly by bronson , never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him into becoming a killer for hire . rhiana , a terribly weak part for theresa saldana , is disgusted by holland for much of the way but later feels an affection for him . where does her love come from , especially after watching holland kill several people and wanting to go home just a few scenes before ? 

the most interesting characters are actually molloch and his sister claire , because so many questions can be asked of them . naturally , we never find out what has brought them so close together , how and where their torture dealings started , what claire ' s exact role in their business isÂthese plot holes can go on forever , especially with the paint-by-numbers storyline that seems to make things up as it goes along . why is hidalgo ' s daughter brought into such a dangerous situation , other than for her to be conveniently taken hostage by molloch ? if molloch ' s bodyguard randolph ( raymond st . jacques ) clearly saw holland and rhiana in the cockfight arena , why is he so friendly with them in a bar afterwords ? is his memory that short ? and what really was the purpose , other than cheap theatrics , of holland throwing molloch ' s chauffeur cillero ( jorge luke ) off a window ledge when the murder could have been handled more discreetly in claire ' s apartment ? 

the overall acting is decent and somehow bronson gives one of his strongest performances . j . lee thompson ' s direction is lacking at points , but may have been compromised by limited time on site . besides evil ' s filming in mexico , the presence of itc is clear through better production values , cinematography , and music . rural locations are well-used to convey the hot and dusty atmosphere of latin america and cinematographer xavier cruz provides rich color and clarity . the orchestral score by ken thorne ( ' murphy ' s war ' ) is refreshing in an era of synthesized junk . oddly enough , these positives only add to the frustration of a good movie that is screaming to come out . peter lee thompson ' s editing is better than usual , although with more laughable continuity errors . 

 ' the evil than men do ' was perfect grindhouse material for the early 80s and i find it hard to recommend for 21st century action fans . the dvd from columbia tristar entertainment is an okay presentation , offering widescreen and standard format with four-language subtitles . while the video quality is well above average , ' evil ' was originally recorded in plain mono audio . the theatrical trailer is offered and actually has a grindhouse feel , with eroded color and fuzzy sound quality . 

 * * out of 4 the dvd sleeve explains the premise : " three problem teens are headed for jail , " and are " set to do time until captain greer offers them a deal to work for him - undercover . " the film opens with definitions of the words " mod " and " squad " , so you won ' t have to look them up in the dictionary . for a visual definition of " cool " , search for photographs of the original threesome : michael cole ( as pete cochran ) , clarence williams iii ( as linc hayes ) , and peggy lipton ( as julie barnes ) . 

one black . one white . one blonde . once they defined cool . 

the three who make up scott silver ' s version of aaron spelling ' s " the mod squad " are twentysomethings : claire danes ( as julie barnes ) , giovanni ribisi ( as pete cochran ) , and omar epps ( as linc hayes ) . they aren ' t able to do much with the material given . mr . ribisi ' s portrayal is the most " far out " , meaning he digresses most from the original characterization . ms . danes romances josh brolin ( as billy waites ) , who looks like he could be in a re-make of " marcus welby , md " . you won ' t believe hefty michael lerner dancing with mr . epps ' " linc " . he explains , " i ' m not a fairy , i just like to dance ! " and requests , " spin me ! " 

 * * * the mod squad ( 1999 ) scott silver ~ claire danes , giovanni ribisi , omar epps there are those who gripe that this is not the opera , but then they don ' t quibble with the film of cabaret that was not the original show either . all films of musicals / operas are and have to be " adaptations " or they don ' t work . cabaret took more liberties with the original show than did the film of porgy and bess and yet it kept its original integrity , reworking the material , and is judged an artistic success . the same holds true for porgy and bess- it reworked the opera into a dialogue / song libretto because audiences at the time loved musicals but stayed away from the few echt filmed operas . it would have been economical suicide for preminger to produce a film of the opera - it would have lost a fortune for the goldwyn studios . 

that said , this is a fine adaptation . the acting is excellent , the oscar winning scoring of andre previn is magnificent , as is the choral singing , and the individual vocal achievements are incredible . robert mcferrin ( dad of popular musician bobby mcferrin ) dubbed porgy and adele addison dubbed bess . while sammy davis jr . sang his own songs in the film , his recording contract would not permit his voice to be heard on the soundtrack album , so cab calloway recorded his numbers ( spectacularly ) for that release . brock peters ' bass / baritone is extraordinary and pearl bailey is her own unique self . diahann carroll , although a singer of fine note , has the small role of clara which required a high soprano , so old reliable marni nixon dubbed her singing . 

the gershwin estate hates the film and refuses to grant the musical rights , although the dramatic rights are in the public domain . this sort of hate feud held up the video release of carousel for almost fifteen years ( although in that case it was the dramatic rights that were in litigation ) and is currently preventing both porgy and bess and annie get your gun from being released on video . 

of all the stage productions given film versions , it is these latter two which are the sole holdouts to video . only a campaign of letters to the gershwin estate in ny might loosen up the reserve .  this has to be one of the all time greatest horror movies . charles band made the best movie of 96 ' in this little seen gem . highly realistic and , incredibly stylised- with a visual flair david fincher would envy , its not hard to see why band went on to make such classics as ' killjoy 2 : deliverance from evil ' , ' the regina pierce affair ' , ' virgins of sherwood forest ' , and ' timegate : tales of the saddle tramps ' . 

with a highly sophisticated story- a tiny body with a large head controls a family of weirdos who perform experiments on naked women , this movie may be a bit too much for younger viewers and is only for the most educated type of viewer , but for those who see it , band is able to convey subtle messages about the human condition through his masterpiece . the head is symbolic of the lost love and longing for one ' s inner self that we all must face at one point or another , and for this reason i was able to engage with this film on a deeply personal level . although many earlier critics have compared band ' s film to re-animator and other lesser works , this stands head and heels above the rest . it is gorier , but not pointlessly . the gore in this film is well crafted and used to enhance the storyline , rather than to just get a cheap shriek out of the audience . also , the special effects in this film are absolutely top notch , easily the best work done in a horror film since . . . well . . . ever ! the work in this film makes savini ' s effects look like the work of a blind , limbless hobo . 

the only problem i have with this film is the copious amounts of full frontal nudity , which were ultimately unnecessary in achieving the composer ' s goal- to create a timeless epic that would forever go down in history as possibly the greatest film of all time . if it were not for this slight problem i would have given this film a perfect 10 .  step up is a fair dance film about some kids that get their big performance break . the film is average in every way with little more for the viewer . a jock fights external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teach who sees something special . the acting was fine , but the dialog and directing had little to add to overcoming a predictable story . none the less you still feel quite good about the outcome of the film . there were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers that went a little overboard . this is a class b+ film with moderate continuity errors and dialog mishaps . the scenery was good and the characters held true to life . it is worth the watch if you like that kind of film .  to be entirely frank , the popularity of this show saddens me . inuyasha is certainly not terrible - it has a few good moments , the occasional flash of clever humour , and , unlike so many animes , dignity . however , it is utterly lacking in the essential elements of a worthwhile story . from the start , its premise dooms it to be stereotypical . the main plot centers around collecting the pieces of a shattered jewel before they can be possessed by evil , and is , as one would suspect , a totally generic epic fantasy affair . the story follows a familiar pattern of fighting off various enemies for pieces of the jewel , and is thus quite predictable , lacking in complexity , and easy to lose interest in . but as so many animes have shown , a poor premise can be rescued by deep , realistic characters . sadly , no one rescues the story of inuyasha . kagome , the main character , is the stereotypical anime heroine ( and far too reminiscent of akane , the main character of the original comic author ' s previous work ranma 1 / 2 ) ; she is kind to other females , but treats many males , especially her love interest , with unfair , unabashed , unjustifiable brutality . inuyasha is a tough-on-the-outside-but-sweet-on-the-inside type , and miroku is the lamentable stock character of " the pervert " . 

the flaws continue with what happens to this plot and these characters - namely , nothing . despite constant action , the story does not progress . despite regular romantic moments , neither does the main relationship . despite ample time , the characters never really change . and to add a cherry to the sundae of mediocrity , all this stagnation is stretched into approximately 150 episodes . 

my final criticism of this anime is the animation . while certainly not ugly , it displays almost disrespectful laziness on the part of the creators . the animators seem to take joy in long scenes of inuyasha jumping through the air with wind whistling in which they have little to do but move a background . 

in short , with all the beautiful animations of the world at one ' s keyboard-perched fingertips , there is absolutely no reason to watch inuyasha .  visually beautiful with some fine music , this film otherwise has a fairly trite made-for-tv quality . the romance between two characters , which spans a cultural and educational divide , is simply not plausible . of course , from early on we knew our persnickety heroine would lighten up , win over the locals , and find true love , but that doesn ' t make it any less woeful that the movie had to take such completely expected turns . this film had lots of promise , which makes it more of a shame that the promise was unrealized . perhaps a nice under-the-blanket on a cold night freebie on cable , but i certainly wouldn ' t recommend paid rental or purchase . i ' m sure the soundtrack is wonderful , though .  after huge budget disaster films set in america like the day after tomorrow and deep impact , it was refreshing to see something on a smaller scale like flood . 

using mainly unknown actors and actresses and actually focusing on england it was a welcome change of pace to seeing the empire state building being demolished . 

however , this is not a strong film on any basis . whilst being fairly shocking seeing all your favourite london landmarks being demolished by a very fake cgi storm surge , flood doesn ' t really deliver on anything else . 

the performances are bland , being saved from the pit of hell by david suchet and his refreshingly calm performance as the deputy priminister . he is perhaps a little too calm for what is going on in the film , all that fake water gushing around london must have made him pretty annoyed . 

it is understandable that the effects weren ' t going to be as good as tdat and di , but the cgi was at best , average . 

bland , disappointing and sometimes even tiresome . watch it if you must , but watch something else straight afterwards .  in new york , in a morning close to christmas , an upper class father and mother go in their bmw to a private school to see the play of their daughter . then they go shopping and later they return to their fancy apartment in manhattan . in the night , they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous neighborhood , where they prepare drugs for distribution . on the christmas eve , while buying the christmas gift for their daughter , the father is kidnapped , and his wife desperately tries to raise a high amount of money to pay the requested ransom . " r xmas " is a deceptive movie of abel ferrara . the lead characters do not have names , are anonymous , and maybe his intention is to tell that in the breast of a neighbor family in your building may have drug dealers ; or that drug dealers may also have families and may be loving persons ; or that there are many dirty cops , probably worse than the criminals ; or is it a simple apology to crime ? whatever ! however , this humanization of criminals is a horrible message , and i really did not like this movie . in brazil , for example , many drug dealers and criminals help their communities , due to the absence of the state in poor areas and slums , but this procedure does not make them model citizen . in this movie , we see a loving upper class family in the day , providing drugs as means of living , but the destruction of the members of other families is not shown in the story , and it is impossible to feel sympathy for any characters . in the end , i wished all of them dead . my vote is four . 

title ( brazil ) : " gangues do gueto " ( " gangs of the ghetto " )  a tedious yawn of a film that retains nothing of the zing and raciness of its predecessor , " gold diggers of 1933 . " the production code was firmly in place by the time of this film ' s release , so the humour is all of the hokey , wocka-wocka variety and gone are the dry one-liners that sounded so cosmopolitan dripping off the lips of the gorgeous dames from the first film . a cast of second-tier stars and character actors go through the motions here , and the " puttin ' on a show " motif seems awfully forced ; instead of the make or break world of broadway , the show here is a charity event hosted by a swanky hotel . who really cares whether or not the show goes on ? the score here is bland too . of course the movie ' s big number is " lullaby of broadway , " which accompanies a long fantasy dance number about a new york socialite ' s eventual demise from too much partying--doesn ' t exactly have the same effect as the searing " forgotten man " number used as the finale in ' 33 . busby berkeley directs as well as choreographs this film , and whatever promise is built up in the film ' s fluid opening scenes quickly deteriorates . unfortunately , no one learned any lessons from this , and there was yet another gold diggers movie two years later . 

grade : c- mr . accident is a deliberate series of non-stop disasters and near death experiences reminiscent of saturday morning ' s warner brothers cartoons . like the coyote who falls off the cliff 5 times per episode , the " leading man " ( more like an over grown klutzy child ) always manages to postpone his meeting with the grimm reaper . 

this australian " surprise " is offensively unfunny , and at times even depressing . the 2 ( out of ten ) are is for the visual stunts ( some never attempted by anyone since daffy duck ) and the use of vivid colors ( like in those high class national laundry detergent commercials ) . 

there may be an age bracket where this " comedy " finds a following . i have definitely passed that age long ago . calling all preteens : here ' s a " ha-ha " for ya !  in london , the venetian carla borin ( yuliya mayarchuk ) is searching an apartment to share with her beloved boyfriend matteo ( jarno berardi ) . she meets the lesbian real estate agent moira ( francesca nunzi ) and rents a large apartment . when the jealous matteo finds some pictures and letters from her former lover bernard ( mauro lorenz ) in venice , he hangs up the phone and the upset and amoral carla has a brief affair with moira and intercourse with an acquaintance in a party . when matteo comes to london , he concludes that his lust for carla is more important than his jealousy and her behavior . 

 " transgredire " is another " soft porn " of the sick director tinto brass with a shallow and ridiculous story where every situation is a motive to expose the intimate parts of the women in the cast . the amateurish camera exposes the body of the beautiful yuliya mayarchuk in every possible angle and her character is abused , touched and licked in every part of her nice body , but without showing explicit penetration . this flick is only recommended to fans of this director and as a voyeur experience seeing yuliya mayarchuk naked in erotic situations . my vote is four . 

title ( brazil ) : " a pervertida " ( " the pervert " )  paul muni and bette davis overact monstrously while lacklustre studio hack archie mayo seems distracted and oblivious in this racially provocative film that derives its " bittersweet ending " by condoning segregationist attitudes . heavy handed and poorly constructed the film collapses under its own weight within the first fifteen minutes with an out of control courtroom scene that it never recovers from as mr . muni begins to chew up scenery by the yard hollering and howling away in an almost incoherent fashion . 

johnny ramirez is a mexican american from the other side of the tracks who through determination and grit attains a law degree from a store front night school . in his first big case involving an auto accident he displays only ineptitude and is quickly made to look the fool by his well heeled opponents and an impatient judge who recommends he be disbarred . devastated by the setback an angry johnny takes on a job at a gambling joint where he is befriended by the owner charlie roark ( eugene palette ) who likes his style . the owner cuts him in on the place but problems arise with mrs . roark ( davis ) who also wants a piece of johnny . she kills charlie , implicates johnny and slowly goes mad before he is acquitted and free to be with a high society wasp who coldly explains to him that they are from " different tribes , savage " and it will never work . when she flees to escape his rage she is run over and killed by a car . ramirez sells the casino and moves back to his poor neighborhood rationalizing that its best to stay with your own . 

in addition to this appalling denouement bordertown has a series of bad performances to compliment the overall ugliness of the story . unfair as his plight might be , muni ' s ramirez is so abrasive and arrogant it becomes hard to show sympathy for such a bull headed blunderer . davis is no better as the less than loyal wife matching the same adolescent emotions of muni . her lady macbeth mad scenes give no indication that she was about to become the best film actress of her era . margaret lindsay as muni ' s american dream is cold , remote and flat . 

bad as bordertown is ( and it is very ) it remains an interesting indicator of the times and acceptable attitudes . the rest is just a mishmash of bad acting and uninspired direction .  director j . s . cardone presents something a little scary and a little creepy , but nothing more . a widowed mother karen tunny ( lori heuring ) inherits a home in the pennsylvania mountains ; so she takes her two daughters and moves into the sprawling estate in what seems the middle of nowhere . but it is somewhere , somewhere ninety some odd years ago a tragic mining accident claimed the lives of numerous children who were forced to labor in the dark and dank . the area and especially the tunny estate seems to be haunted by the spirits of the tiny little wicked souls . the legend is the screaming children come out in the moonlight to seek their revenge ; and you better believe it . also in the cast : ben cross , scout taylor-compton , chloe moretz , julie rogers and geoffrey lewis .  the thesis of father brown is that a good dose of roman catholicism will solve all of life ' s problems . a little proselytizing i don ' t mind , but this gets a bit ridiculous at times . 

some fine actors have played father brown over the years , kenneth more and barnard hughes are two good examples . alec guinness plays him in this film and does all right by him , but you didn ' t see any great demand for future father brown films . 

i suppose if you are a committed roman catholic it all makes perfectly good sense . it ' s far more important to catch the thief and convert him to your religion than see he ' s brought to justice . 

but that ' s what were asked to accept here . in fact there is a preliminary story before the main action of the film . guinness in clerical garb is caught trying to put back stolen articles that one of his parishioners sidney james had heisted during a robbery . 

that ' s the story he gives the local cops and of course this is something that james has confided in him so he can ' t break the confessional . 

now on to bigger game . master thief flambeau , played by peter finch has stolen a cross that is entrusted to father brown and was said to belong to st . augustine back in the day . but father brown is more interested in getting flambeau to go back to his faith than seeing him brought to justice . so he misleads the cops so he can accomplish his mission . 

i ' m sorry but this whole thing was just too much for me to swallow . father brown i ' d hate to say it was guilty of obstruction and ought to have been arrested . and he was under no obligation not to reveal anything he knew about flambeau , the man had not come to him as a penitent seeking absolution and spiritual advice . 

author g . k . chesterton , a very noted catholic lay person in his day , finds all this very reasonable . carried to his logical conclusion we should replace all police forces with an army of priests . 

guinness borrows from his own reverend ascoyne d ' ascoyne from kind hearts and coronets and from barry fitzgerald in going my way to create father brown . granted though brown is a lot shrewder than the other two . there ' s also a bit of colonel nicholson in this portrayal . in the bridge on the river kwai , guinness also was playing a character who ' s rather weird interpretation of the rules caused him to lose sight of what was important in the situation nicholson was in . 

father brown ' s an entertaining fellow when he ' s solving mysteries and making the authorities look foolish . we ' ve enjoyed brother cadfael do it in a medieval setting and american audiences liked father dowling played by tom bosley a few years back . 

this film should have stuck to being entertaining .  great acting , great production values , good direction . 

but the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the first half and then falls apart in the second half . we ' re clear on character and motivation for the first half but then the second half leaves many questions unanswered . 

the conflicts raised are compelling but the follow-through is weak . for instance , we ' re very clear that rudyard kipling is pro-war but we don ' t know if that philosophical stance changes through the course of the film . 

this is the sort of picture that makes me want to look up the facts in history books . i don ' t feel i can rely on the film to get a clear idea . 

the depiction of the war itself is heart-breakingly accurate , though the women ' s lack of enthusiasm doesn ' t reflect the war hysteria that swept britain at the time . perhaps this is historically accurate ; like so much in this film , i simply don ' t know .  while this isn ' t an all time classic comedy it is a pretty good little movie to watch if you catch it on a rainy saturday morning with not a lot else going on right then . 

harold lloyd plays ezekiel cobb , an american coming home after growing up in china where his dad was a missionary . he has come home from china to find an american wife and plans to return to china to continue his father ' s work . cobb unwittingly is recruited to run for mayor of his corrupt home town when the existing political machine that controls the town realizes that he would make a perfect patsy to run against the current mayor who also is the head of the town ' s underworld . they figure the bumbling , stumbling cobb has no chance to win and therefore the current mayor continues to run the town and run his schemes which makes them all rich . 

lloyd isn ' t doing the physical comedy here like he did in his silent films . he does a convincing portrayal of cobb with a reserved understated dignity . the acting was good from all involved and the story and script were also quite good . 

being made in 1934 the film does have some rather racist language when talking about the chinese and it also has a typical black character from that era but these stereotypes aren ' t nearly as mean as i ' ve seen from other films from that time . 

although not close to being lloyd ' s best film , this movie does entertain and lloyd is very good as cobb . you won ' t be blown away by this film but it may be enough to peak your interest in lloyd and make you want to see more of his work .  i am sure i ' m in the minority ( i know i am among my friends ) , but i found this movie long , boring and gratuitous . the fact that the role played by denis leary is the most likable character ( the only other time i liked him at all was in " a bug ' s life " ! ) speaks volumes . rene russo ' s character was irritating beyond belief and thomas crowne himself was flat and stereotypical . to say he was two-dimensional may be a little generous . ( no , the scenes with his psychiatrist did not help make him real . ) 

with the exception of two wonderful scenes ( both involving the museum caper and not involving rene russo ) , this movie made me wish i were at home watching televised golf .  tamara anderson and her family are moving once again , as her itinerant painter father chases his next landscape . fifteen years old , she is in her rebellious stage . already angry at her father for their frequent relocations , her anger is exacerbated when her mother is suddenly confined to a sanatorium for tuberculosis . her mother ' s absence causes tamara to lash out at her father and seek comfort in religion , the boy next door , rusty , as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who used to live in her rented house . 

the story is modest to a fault . it ' s oddly paced , and even during its emotional scenes there isn ' t any tension . the actors portraying the parents are fine . alberta watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother , and maria ricossa is particularly effective as the guilt-ridden mother of the dead teenager . but katie boland , as tamara , is too amateurish to carry the movie . the dialog is very natural and boland can ' t quite pull it off . she has her moments and when she hits them she can be good but there were too many times when she came off awkward . one can see her thinking ' ok this is what my line is and this is the face i ' m supposed to make ' rather than actually reacting to the other actors . she ' s not the only one , kevin zegers as rusty and megan park as his sister brenda also suffer from stilted delivery but at least they ' re in fewer scenes . 

if done right , the screenplay could have made her an affecting movie . and it has it moments but much of it is bogged down with an amateurish lead performance and flat directing .  paul mazursky misfires on this film . the writing , direction , casting , and acting ( with the exception of victorio gassman ) are all off the mark . i remember the reviews from 20+ years ago being mediocre , but i thought it still might be worthwhile to view . with notables such as susan sarandon , raul julia ( who overacts in most of his scenes ) and john cassavetes , i understandably expected much more . the music picked for the film is jarring , the cuts between new york and greece confusing , and the overall pace all leave much to be desired . why paul mazursky felt the need to update this story , or add his touch to it is puzzling - this retelling of prospero and his daughter takes very little of import from the play , and adds not much more . the play is not one of shakespeare ' s best anyway , and to gut it even further seems not to be a good decision . unfortunately , there is nothing to recommend in this film .  jason connery is not an actor ; he is the son of an actor . his macbeth is the worst i have ever seen . oh yes , he murders king duncan , but he also kills william shakespeare . his wife is even worse . please , give me polanski ' s version on dvd , so i can forget this monster . jon finch , orson welles , laurence olivier , there you have actors !  a party-hardy frat boy ' s sister is brutally murdered by a street gang , sending the young man into a sudden psychotic rampage . he and his buddies massacre half the city to bring his sister back to life . 

savage streets was released a year after this film , and was more entertaining . linnea quigley , who has a costarring role in this film as the sexy ( and briefly nude ) girlfriend of one of the guys , also starred in savage streets . 

this film is subpar , though it delivers enough escapist entertainment and gratuitous nudity to please its intended audience ( me ) . 

mpaa : rated r for strong violence , nudity , language , and some sexuality .  i was loaned this dvd by the director of a film i am working with , in which i play an actor who is playing prospero . knowing his own style , i did not expect anything resembling a " classical " interpretation of the text . 

what i have found is sometimes striking , sometimes evocative , but often meandering and tedious . like most experimental music , i find that in films such as this , the building blocks of powerful film-making are crafted , even if they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format . 

thus we have a caliban who is more a clown than a threat , and who not even miranda seems terribly afraid of ( which is odd , since we know that he has attempted to rape her at least once ) . a stefano and trinculo who are more annoying than funny . an oddly young prospero who looks like amadeus . and a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized posturing . 

interestingly enough , i do not have an issue with the way in which ferdanand or miranda are portrayed . his stunned rapture and her slightly freaky innocence are actually quite appropriate . 

i do not say that this is a bad film , but an experimental one . one that takes huge risks , but is meant more for students of art and film and not really for anyone with an interest in the tempest for its own sake .   ( some spoilers ) dull as dishwater slasher flick that has this deranged homeless man harry , darwyn swalve , out murdering real-estate agent all over the city of l . a because of the high prices that they charge for their proprieties . looking like an extra from a clint eastwood " spaghetti western " harry who ' s been living in abandoned houses eating dog food get ' s very upset where his quite lifestyle as a squatter is interrupted . this happens when a number of real-estate agents invaded his space in an attempt to sell the houses , that he ' s staying at to their potential clients . 

joseph bottome stars in this bottom-of-the-barrel horror movie as radio talk-show host dr . david kelly the handsome and popular host psychologist of the kdrx survival line . dr . kelly is being sued by the family of one of his callers , tracy , who ended up blowing her brains out while on the air with the doc who couldn ' t do anything to help her survive her ordeal of taking to him . 

the real-estate killer gets to talk with dr . kelly on the air about his adventures and the police try to get the doc to get his phone number and address , by keeping him on the line , but he refuses to in order not to hurt his rating by having potential callers not call in in fear of being monitored by the ladp . 

kelly also is having a hot and heavy affair with a real-estate manager and agent the busty lisa grant , adrienne barbeau , who ' s office of sellers are harry ' s main victims in he movie . harry also gets to murder lisa ' s main competition in the housing business the chubby and outrageous barney resnick , barry hope , who threatened to put lisa out of business by any means possible even if he has to kill her . 

getting berney alone and with his pants down harry slices his head off while he ' s being entertained by one of his clients , a hooker , whom he leaves dead and hanging together with the headless barney . the movie ends with the deranged harry taking lisa hostage and having dr . kelly try to come to her rescue only to have det . shapiro ( robert miano ) , looking like e hasn ' t slept in a week , pop out of nowhere and blow harry ' s brains out . harry quickly come back to life minus the gay matter between his ears and gets himself killed for the second time in the movie by being thrown from a balcony and landing on the ground as a dozen members of the lapd , m16 cocked and ready , come on the scene . 

nothing in the movie " opean house " worked with the tension laughable to almost non-existent . even the hot sex scenes between dr . kelly and lisa didn ' t save the movie since there were far too few , only two , of them and and sexy adrienne barbeau was a bit too underexposed , with not enough light and too much clothes on , in all of them . 

harry the killer in the movie was also a bit to comical to be taken seriously in trying to make a point , to dr . kelly on the phone and in person , about the high rents and real-estate prices in the country and how people like himself find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live in . you can sympathize with harry ' s concern about the high cost of living but be very critical of him in how he crazily went on in correcting it .  this is indeed one of the weakest films based on agatha christie ' s work , a lifeless , muddled mystery that clearly lacks the grace ( and the budget ! ) of its predecessors ( " death on the nile " , " evil under the sun " ) and donald sutherland is a pale shadow of peter ustinov as far as screen detectives go ( of course , he is playing a character much less interesting than poirot ) . the film manages to coast as far as it does on the strength of christie ' s plot alone ( all her plots have a certain amount of inherent interest ) , but the direction is hopelessly flat . ( * 1 / 2 )  the parallels between this film and " captain walrus " ( an independant film shown at the team projection film festival in 1994 ) are so blindingly obvious that any praise for " sally marshall is not an alien " must be viewed with the knowledge that it is riding on the success of another work . 

in captain walrus , two young boys ( geoff and roger , played by dean turner and brett allen respectively ) examine the bizarre behaviour of their new neighbour britney ( played by louise farley ) . as the two boys watch through their telescope , they observe the repeated visits of a man in uniform who they call captain walrus ( played by peter sargent ) . however , the emphasis in captain walrus is on the pointless and somewhat power-hungry actions of the neighbour britney , and less on the friendship between the two boys . 

a critical success at the film festival , the plot of captain walrus has obviously been appropriated and rehashed in order to give the australian film community another notch on the belt with regards to children ' s product . although sally marshall is not an alien is a fine film , and a credit to its producers , its inauthenticity leaves something to be deserved .  why spend a moment slogging through this awkward and self-conscious movie ? every now and then , after an hour of tedious plot and amateur acting , we start getting bits and pieces of the big band swing that made tommy and jimmy dorsey , separately and together , the great musicians they were . occasionally -- in a jam session with art tatum , with tommy dorsey and his orchestra doing " marie " and , a standout , jimmy dorsey and his orchestra fronting bob eberle and helen o ' connell singing " green eyes " -- we get a complete song . 

unfortunately , the movie is in the public domain and the dvd transfer is just as bad as the acting . my copy has only four chapter stops . that means you can get arthritis in your fast- forward finger trying to speed through to where the good stuff is . the swamp you ' re moving through is hollywood ' s version of the life and battles of the two dorseys . tommy , superb on trombone , and jimmy , superb on saxophone , usually couldn ' t stand each other . in 1935 they finally split , with tommy starting his own orchestra . each had greater success alone than they had achieved together . they reconciled when their father died in the forties , which is where the movie ends . they later managed to tolerate each other in the orchestra led by tommy as the big band era faded out in the fifties . tommy died in 1956 at age 51 , vomiting in his sleep after booze , pills and a big meal . jimmy died of cancer at 53 in 1957 . jimmy was hugely talented and , from all accounts , a reasonably easy-going guy . tommy was hugely talented and , from all accounts , often an overbearing jerk . but good music makes up for a lot of faults , and the big band sounds the two created helped define the swing era . 

they play themselves in the movie , and we see them develop from tussling tykes ( with child actors ) to grown men battling and yammering at each other . the movie is lumbered with not just their two parents , played by those hollywood irish clichÃ©s , sara allgood and arthur shields , who just want their boys to get along with each other , but also with a major sub- story involving a romance between janet blair , as a childhood friend of the dorseys who becomes a vocalist with them and serves as a nearly full-time mediator and enabler , and william lundigan , as a piano player . blair is not bad at all . however , if you want to see why she never became the star she quite probably should have become , just look at the films , like this one , that her studio put her in . no wonder she left hollywood . lundigan simply takes up space . 

how bad is this movie , other than when we can actually hear the dorseys play ? well , here ' s a song written especially for the movie and given to blair to warble . it ' s called " to me . " 

to me . . . you ' re the rose of a rosary . . . the rise of a rising sea . . . the glow of a star . . . 

the rose of a rosary ? the movie doesn ' t get any better than this , and it can ' t get worse . still , if you like the dorseys and if the price is right . . . well , in hindsight i ' d still not buy it . the highlight , for me , is eberle and o ' connell singing " green eyes . " you can watch them on you tube for free . you ' ll also find there quite a bit of each of the dorseys . i wish i ' d known .  in 1976 a mother named norma lewis ( cameron diaz ) lives with her son walter and her husband arthur ( james marsden ) . one night a box is placed on the doorstep of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key . by the late afternoon , a man with terrible scarring on his face comes to their door and presents norma with an offer . this man is arlington steward ( frank langella ) and he announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash . if they don ' t press it , nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else . norma and arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal . the incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties . arthur , who is currently working for nasa , fails to be accepted into a new job he applies for and norma , who is a teacher , learns that her faculty funding is being cut . 

one ' s enjoyment for this bizarre sci-fi thriller , based on the short story " button button " by richard matheson , will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ludicrous premise . the opening of the film is particularly problematic in grounding itself in a sense of realism with the household . richard kelly ' s previous film donnie darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes . without the dream-like state of that far superior film , the box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world , is entirely implausible . that norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same scarring as two-face from the dark knight and believe this offer , seems equally contrived . 

if this sounds unlikely so far , what follows is even more absurd , involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning , the possibility of alien life or some other godly being influencing these situations . scenes involving gateways opening up in public libraries , random nose bleeds and mindless drones stalking the lewis family , become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity . to a point , the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going . kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to hold our attention through many of the films contrivances . in one scene norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot . he taunts her about it as she is missing four of her toes . later , at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that norma and arthur are attending , this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be stalking them . yet the eventual justification for these all of these oddities is wrapped up in a highly contrived sci-fi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow . 

what is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on , many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished for much of pictures duration . the ending , which won ' t be spoilt here , resurfaces these moral questions again in the hope of echoing that of a greek tragedy . while the resemblances can be seen , by this point , given the unlikelihood of so much of the film and the uneven performances , there is little reason to care . cameron diaz ' s southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly langella who is the most disappointing in the film , with a very unsubtly written role , as the mysterious scarred man , who seems to be hiding a military base that would make dr . evil proud . it really is just a shadow of his towering performance in frost / nixon . there is not a lot for many of the other actors in the film to do ; in particular both norma and arthur could not be regarded as characters but mouthpieces for kelly ' s pastiche of ideas . underdeveloped and brief conversations , such as where norma sympathises with arlington over their deformities and also when norma and arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button kills either of them , highlights this . 

since 2001 , richard kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of donnie darko . though this film might be intriguing for a little while , it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the film ' s rather illogical revelations . science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions , but what kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic . the box is one film this year that should have been shelved .  john knowles modern masterpiece , a separate peace , are one of many subtle , and subtly is the watch word , themes of love , hate , jealously , denial and regret . the 1972 version does attempt to address this style and what the book is - a love story with war looming in the background . 

the 2004 version does not use subtly at all but overtness in the portrayal of the story . what is staring you in the face when you read the novel - is a love story , and yes maybe it is arguable , a gay love story . in the novel and 1972 film version there are sexual undertones everywhere in the writings and dialog . in the 2004 showtime film version these tensions were omitted and the actors were in there late twenties playing teenagers which caused for mature acting taking away from any tenderness or hesitation of innocence in youth . 

i did not like this remake for more reasons . the hair that broke the camels ' back was that phineas was given a surname on the letters he received from the draft boards ! finny is a character that does not have nor needs a last name . john knowles did that intentionally . 

though i accept the 1972 version the acting was at times a little amateurish , so what , it attempted to be sincere to the novel by shooting on location at phillips exeter academy that the devon acedemy was based on ; which also the writer john knowles attended as a student . 

the directors and producers took all teenage exeter students , with exception of parker stevenson whom attended the brooks school , to play in a paramount film ! class act by preppies compared to this canadian college shot , played with adult actors , politically correct , platonic version . no - veto on this sham try again . the 1972 film version with john heyl and parker stevenson was the real deal for a separate peace on the screen . the showtime 2004 film made for cable version was not .  like its near contemporaries " the great race " and " those magnificent men in their flying machines " , i always associate this film with my childhood especially at new year . on new year ' s day we ' d visit my granny and after lunch , while the adults talked , the kids would watch tv where invariably one of these three crazy race films would be on . 

for that reason alone , i really wanted to mark " monte carlo or bust " well but i fear i can ' t , the child not being father to the man on this occasion . by which i mean i can see all too clearly its faults and while i was tempted to smile occasionally , in truth i really wanted all the competitors to get to the end of the race long before they actually do . 

of course it ' s dated by its stereotyping of nationalities and woman as the weaker sex and i also didn ' t much care for one or two stray , admittedly mild vulgarities which occasionally surfaced . more than that though , the cast , despite hamming it up outrageously just don ' t sell the film enough . tony curtis , in a trial run for his " yank abroad " turn in the tv series " the persuaders " , seems too old to be playing the young gallant , terry thomas just isn ' t dastardly enough , eric sykes is unbelievable as a dirty-minded lothario while gert frobe as an overdone teuton , is just weird doing camp comedy when you remember he was bond ' s best villain goldfinger . if anything the englishers come off best - susan hampshire is at least engaging as a " bright young thing " , suitably gamine as a posh flapper and although chained to the leash of the script pete and dud offer the most amusement as stiff upper lip army types , although even then the " carry on " team did this so much better in " carry on up the khyber pass " . 

director annakin tries everything to evoke the " golden silents " , with lashings of slapstick , mistaken identity capers , speeded up camera shots , would-be dramatic stunts and some light romance , but there ' s no real tension for such a famous race and anyway the race-off at the end seems like another swizz . 

actually i ' d have given it another mark if they ' d stuck to the alternative title " those magnificent men in their jaunty jalopies " but in truth the animated series " wacky races " did this so much better .  this show has been performed live around the country with a wide variety of casts . i saw it first in the provincetown production the first summer it was in p-town ( 2001 ) --before it was , curiously enough , banned in that overwhelmingly gay resort ( the codes which resulted in its closing have since been amended ) . i saw it again later in the off-broadway , long-running production in new york . oddly enough , the p-town production was far better than the new york one--fresher , cuter , more spirited and funnier--but that was only in the 2001 showing ; subsequent attempts to clone the production ( " bare naked lads " in 2007 ) were definitely third-rate . this filmed production features a los angelos production cast , and it is , as other comments have suggested , not the best . i would rate it somewhere in between the top-notch 2001 p-town production and the third-rate " bare naked lads " p-town show from last summer .  i am currently 22 years old , and remember seeing this movie in the theatres when it first came out . you heard me right , i was 5 years old , and yet i can still distinctly remember what i saw that afternoon so many years ago . was it a mystical trip through the fantastic world of mark twain ' s creativity ? . . . no , on the other hand , it was a quite creepy film about mark twain ' s dark , depressed , and in fact suicidal side . one scene that still bothers me was a particularly strange scene in which mark twain is playing the organ at his own funeral . 

would an adult enjoy this film ? well , this movie quite possibly features some interesting viewpoints that a person with a working knowledge of mark twain ' s writing might enjoy ; but trust me on this , " adventures " is not the film you want to use to introduce your young children to mark twain .  i am ashamed of myself that i actually went to the theatre to watch this movie when it was first released . while i suppose its thinly veiled depiction of the aristotle onassis and jackie kennedy story is well enough done , it ' s a movie that should never have been made in the first place ; hence , my low rating . 

the film chronicles the tale of a wealthy greek business shark called theo tomasis , who woos and wins the lovely young widow , liz cassidy , of a slain american president . sound familiar ? yes , everything except the names . 

the cast is not to be faulted . anthony quinn plays the greek tycoon to perfection , and at least it ' s some consolation , having just read that ari himself requested quinn for the role . jacqueline bisset is of course beautiful and sophisticated in the part of ( for all intents and purposes ) jackie , and james franciscus has the all american good looks of the president . 

i haven ' t seen this movie since it came out , nor do i wish to see it again . i seem to recall a fair bit of bad language and some general crudeness . otherwise , i suppose it ' s a sensational and supposedly intimate glimpse into the jet setting lives of the rich and famous , frolicking aboard their yachts , beaches , pools etc . yes , the scenery of the greek islands is spectacular , the best part of the movie . 

of its type , it ' s okay , i suppose . there are no end of tv movies about the kennedys , which i confess to occasionally tuning in to , and not to my credit . this is basically just another . far better to allow aristotle and jacqueline kennedy onassis to rest in peace .  northanger abbey is not my favorite jane austen novel , but it has its charms . this movie doesn ' t . it has some of the same character names as the book , but the story is drastically altered , and the sweetest man in the whole austen canon ( unless emma ' s mr . knightley gets pride of place ) is made out to be a heartless and mercenary creep . one or two totally extraneous characters are introduced , and a palpable air of corseted perversion hangs over it all . i was so disappointed when i first saw it on its release in 1986 ; even today it ranks high on the list of films that disgrace the books on which they ' re based . even robert hardy fans should give this one a wide berth . it has nothing , and i mean n-o-t-h-i-n-g , to recommend it .  after the turning point of night must fall , robert montgomery ( for the most time ) came into his finest films and performances : here comes mr . jordan , they were expendable , the lady in the lake , ride the pink horse , the saxon charm , june bride . even some of the failures he was in were interesting enough to be still watchable ( rage in heaven , mr . and mrs . smith ) . but montgomery wanted to do more and more production and directing work . in 1949 he made what would be his last movie performance - he played collier lang , an egotistical movie star , who is dragged into helping the authorities do an investigation about a young girl ' s boyfriend . 

apparently my view of this film is a minority view . most of the views given are favorable about it . i thought it was a dull , witless script , with ann blyth ' s groupie heroine not very appealing as a character . she admires montgomery as a star , and this " helps " when he is called in to assist the authorities , but after awhile i found there was no chemistry between them . the script was also devoid of much fun , although montgomery and roland winters did try . the only thing i recall to this day as a joke point was that taylor holmes is the wealthy father of blyth , and he is an admirer of winston churchill . so he always dresses up as churchill , and we see him wearing a floppy broad brimmed hat , smoking a large cigar , and painting ( holmes ' bald head helps in the disguise ) . that was the most memorable joke from this film - not much of a real memory . 

montgomery went into early television , and finally won the attention and respect he always had deserved in motion pictures . his last contact with the movies was his direction of the gallant hours about admiral william " bull " halsey , starring his friend jimmy cagney . it is a far better film than this . for his overall film and television career , i will give this mediocre film a " 4 " . that strikes me as generous .  extremely slow movie . there are fine performances from all actors which is why above 5 score . surya and jyo are supposed to be this ideal husband and wife and we are shown this till it gets to a point you start asking is there a story . then one day jyo discovers surya ' s diary to find his failed college love story . the college love story is totally unconvincing as surya is an arrogant senior who is always picking on bhoomika , beats up her friend , yells at her in public and despite being terrified of him she falls in love for him . even after that he continues to dominate her using crude language . i certainly could not appreciate the meek character played by bhoomika , i don ' t think any self respecting woman will fall for such jerks in real life . so jyo decides to bring them together and what happens after that is the climax . the story is extremely weak in its characters . a extremely arrogant surya to bhoomika is the exact opposite with jyo ( and there is no reason given for the sudden change in character ) . again a extremely meek bhoomika becomes a big extrovert when she returns . wonder , if she had turned so super confident why didn ' t she try to find her love as she no longer feared anyone .  atmosphere and droll dialog don ' t redeem this overrated classic . boyer is a french thief hiding in the casbah of algiers while the police try to figure out how to get him out . meanwhile , he falls for lamarr and tries to find a way to escape . the film is slow to get started and never really goes anywhere . reminiscent of casablanca in some ways , it ' s completely lacking any larger theme than the wanted man seducing a good woman . it ' s all talk-talk-talk , with endless scenes of boyer swaggering among his idiot cohorts and boyer wooing lamarr in the shadows . personally , i didn ' t care for boyer ' s character for a minute , so the tension was utterly nonexistent . 

stock 1930s character actors stumble thru the mushy plot as boyer ' s henchmen--guys who clearly do not belong in algiers . sigrid gurie is the wildly-overacting jealous girlfriend of boyer . his brazen womanizing in front of her doesn ' t bode well for any future he might have with lamarr . 

especially bad is a long sequence in which an underling comes to tell boyer how another henchman was captured . it sounds exciting . . . too bad we didn ' t see it for ourselves . the ending is completely anticlimactic and seems to be remarkable only because it is not a hollywood happy ending ; that doesn ' t stop it from being sappy .  director / screenwriter allan burns seems to have patched two different scripts together before coming up with this minor outing : a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage . it results in a wincingly unfunny film . christine lahti plays a crass , cynical tv news reporter who makes friends with aerobics instructor mary tyler moore and is soon having dinner with moore and her family--only to discover mary ' s husband ( ted danson ) is lahti ' s secret affair ! burns has a strange , stop-and-start rhythm to his dialogue which is neither realistic nor effective ( just increasingly annoying , because nothing important ever seems to get said ) . rail-thin moore , looking alarmingly frail in her leotard , has a radiant smile but doesn ' t convince as danson ' s wife , and danson gets stuck with a paltry , thankless role ( he ' s just there to be a cad ) . the movie attempts to cover all the bases in a classic case of overreaching ( woman ' s role in the workplace , the tv news-biz , the cheating family man , the working wife and mother who wants more , a woman ' s need for female friendships , et al ) , but nothing substantial comes out of these ideas since burns only half-heartedly examines the issues . as a writer , he is surprisingly free of punchlines , but is devoid of a purpose as well , and the heavy plotting just gets all fouled up . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  journalist bob woodward ' s blistering , scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor john belushi ' s rise and fall becomes a wholly misjudged movie , a nebulous " fantasy " directed by larry peerce as if he were doing something edgy and vital . michael chiklis ( years before his breakthrough on " the shield " ) is put in the unenviable position of portraying belushi , taking a post-mortem trip through his life , recreating those " saturday night live " skits which are now part of tv history . it ' s like watching someone try to out-lucy lucille ball--it can ' t be done . the reason why there was such sorrow at belushi ' s death was because he was one of a kind . chiklis makes a commendable attempt at looking the part , and he ' s funny in an early scene trying to escape from the morgue . still , it ' s an uphill venture and no actor--no matter how talented--could have saved it . * from * * * *  director / lead actor dutcher revels in this look-at-me film , wherein he attempts to gain worldly acceptance for tarnishing the otherwise very upbeat world of mormon missionaries . some of the acting is fair . but some roles are unrealistic , i . e . the ominous ( rather than fatherly ) mission president , etc . the film does give a fair look at how some missionaries may struggle with their faith , but the actual missionary program he claims to represent is far from his concept of it , in terms of being upbeat , cohesive , and inspired . the only inspiration i see in this film is dutcher ' s self-inspiration . the film is slow and boring , and the shooting and screenplay look like a college student project .  realty television crew are assigned to cover a small town high school hockey team running into a serial killer wearing a black mask and hoody . lots of interviews where the members of the crew ( and some of the locals who live in the town of white plains where most of this film is set ) talk into the camera about each other , those they encounter in the town of white plains , their current situations , and the showbiz side of their lives . the screenplay is often acidic , cynical , and caustic and killer movie essentially pokes fun at realty television shows , featuring a cast of characters one might find on the real world . if this plot is attractive to you , knock yourself out . i found the characters tiresome and the satire is old hat . out of the cast , paul wesley , the director needing a big break , encountering more than he could possibly bargain for , jake tanner , is a nice guy , coming off very likable and tolerant of the crap he must contend with , considering the prima donnas and immature people in his entourage who often cause nothing but migraines . particularly irksome is his producer lee ( cyia batten ) , a tyrant constantly barking orders to everyone , her poisonous attitude creating much tension . . she ' s the type of producer who wishes to capitalize on a small town eruption regarding the killer , using the hockey team cover story as a front to exploit the tragedy occurring in white plains . those familiar with kaley cuoco know that by now she has perfected the pampered princess , got it down pat because it ' s the only role we ever see her in most of the time . as blanca , she ' s polarizing the way she demands attention , milking what little celeb status she has to the hilt , manufacturing much friction as she becomes a source of frustration , and has quite the potty mouth ( cuoco may ' ve taken the part just so she could escape her usual television sitcom roles , allowed to spout profanity without restriction ) cuoco , along with the entire cast , services killer movie as eye candy , but it ' s hard to find any character you wouldn ' t want to see hacked to pieces with a meat cleaver . jason london is the sound / equipment guy , a real creep with a sour attitude , often tormenting the others with his foul comments that are uncalled for . we witness lots of personality clashes , watching how these self-absorbed hollywood types in the cast snipe at each other . the killer ' s identity shouldn ' t surprise anyone , it ' s quite blatantly obvious . some minor gore , but most of the violence is shot off-screen . despite some tame lesbianism , not even this is satisfying . leighton meester pops up in the film as a cute victim . director / writer jeff fisher assembles quite an attractive cast , but i wouldn ' t be able to distinguish this from the innumerable slashers that have stocked the horror shelves over the last ten or so years since scream . while i ' ve never liked any of cuoco ' s characters , i never tire of looking at her , but eventually she needs to come up with a role that doesn ' t consist of her preening , with smug arrogance , always whining and complaining .  woody allen ( who i have to confess at the outset i have never been a big fan of ) directed this quasi-documentary about the life of emmett ray ( sean penn ) , a 1930 ' s jazz guitarist whose star apparently shone for a while , then quickly faded . penn does a credible job in the role , portraying a complicated and somewhat neurotic man ( not unlike allen himself , which perhaps explains why woody would be attracted to this project ) who can ' t maintain relationships , and whose twin passions ( aside from guitar playing ) were shooting rats at the dump and watching trains . 

there isn ' t a great deal of consistency to the story . it ' s narrated in a sense by a series of modern-day jazz " experts " ( one of whom is allen himself ) , who relate their various theories and interpretations of different events in ray ' s life . the end result is a wildly inconsistent account of the life of a fictional man who seems to have been given a fairly interesting life story by his creators , who probably should have done a better job with it . 

jazz fans and fans of woody allen will probably enjoy this . as for me ? the best i can give it is a 3 / 10 .  like the previous commentator on this film , i too found myself in tears at times during this movie . sometimes one wonders how a film of such awe-inspiring awfulness comes into existence . from the first moment when our protagonist wakes up in his new york apartment from a dream of subway trains intercut with galloping horses ( what irish emigrant hasn ' t had that one ) , its clear we are in trouble . and it doesn ' t get much better . 

whisked back to 1950s ireland , we enter a world where everybody speaks without intonation , and exclusively on the topic of the irish civil war . schoolchildren go to school to learn about the civil war . the drinkers in the pub divide themselves according to their civil war allegiances . remembrances are carried out for those who died in the civil war . the town is divided between those who believe we should remember and those who want to forget . . . the civil war . every glance and conversation is dripping with meaning that traces back to the civil war . 

the blurb on the videocover of broken harvest suggests that the film is a parable of the troubles in modern ireland . the only parallel which strikes me is that in present day dublin conversation is indeed dominated by one topic : house prices . if its intention is to offer some sort of insight into ireland ' s obsession with its past , it fails miserably . it is striking how few irish films have dealt with the irish civil war and its legacies . however it will take a film of a great deal more subtlety and intelligence than this one to tell us anything about the lasting effects of such a traumatic event on the nation ' s psyche . 

for those american viewers who have suggested the film evokes the atmosphere of 1950s ireland : it doesn ' t . 1950s ireland was a horrible , poverty stricken pit of sexual repression and misery from which young people fled in their droves . however there was more than one topic of conversation .  first off , if you want to make a good film , don ' t cram all your exposition into the last 10 minutes . the viewer is expected to be bewildered for nearly two hours , only to have margo ' s father explain everything to alex very late in the film . to make matters worse , the scriptwriter decided it wasn ' t enough to have the basic mystery solved , but adds in a completely unnecessary murder that we knew nothing about ( involving alex ' s father ! ) . 

there ' s some serious motivation issues with characters also . margo ' s father ' s choices don ' t seem to make sense once the film is over . why didn ' t he just kill philippe ' s father and be done with it ? instead , a complicated plot to obscure the truth is concocted , but one which ensures that everyone will be in physical jeopardy for years ( including the completely innocent photographer , who gets murdered by philippe ' s father ' s thugs ) . although alex is a doctor ( whom one would think is relatively bright ) , he chooses to flee the police , during which he not only endangers his own life , but those whom he involves in a nasty pile-up on the freeway . why was margo ' s friend so keen on keeping her promise to margo , once all the crap hits the fan for alex ? and are we to think that margo ' s father would rather kill himself rather than go to prison ? what about his wife ? did he consider her wishes ? those are some of the main problems . 

then there are some nasty details , like : why was her father there the night of her faked death ? how did he get a hold of the junkie ' s body on such short notice and get it back quickly in order to bury it with the other two ? alex ' s friend bruno seems over-eager to be part of the mayhem , in which he and his friends have to kill for alex , notwithstanding the perceived debt he owes alex for saving his son ' s life . what good would the photos of margo do ? they don ' t implicate philippe at all . and why would margo have the safety deposit box key handy that night for her would-be abductors to take ? did i miss some other things ? probably . minor irritations of mine include the fact that although alex is a doctor , he smokes like a fiend . which makes his marathon run away from the police even that more impressive . also , when he is riding in the convertible with his lawyer , neither of them is wearing a seat belt . how bright could they be ?  it may be difficult to believe , but the basic plot of this abysmal flick has been lifted from hitchcock ' s perennial classic , " vertigo " . to see edward james olmos in the part once played by james stewart is heart-breaking ; sean young is better , but still a poor substitute for kim novak .  a tedious mixture of puerile efforts at humour with romantic relationship melodrama fails to provide this weakly made film with any flavour of reality . as action opens , reno ( a . j . buckley ) enters his apartment , there discovering his girlfriend in flagrante delicto with his roommate , who gloatingly tells reno " well , at least it ' s with someone you know " , resulting in reno ' s decision to never have another roommate , this decision told to viewers by means of a soon abandoned voice-over . the storyline then proceeds ten months where we find that reno is indeed true to his word concerning avoidance of roommates , although this appears to beg the question due to his garnering of a live-in lover , holly ( holly fields ) , with whom he has generated marital plans . the plot briefly shifts to a sleazy hollywood strip club , wherein reno ' s uncle charley , enamoured of a " dancer " whom he finds eminently desirable , keels over dead atop the club ' s bar after seeing the unadorned charms displayed by the object of his affections . it is apparent that charley had been aware of the flawed condition of his heart , because he created a video tape during which his commentary bequeaths his large ( and mortgaged ) residence in hollywood to reno , and we see the latter deciding to , contrary to his vow , interview applicants for two roommates as tenants , with he and holly sharing the selection process in an organized manner . following an inane sequence involving bizarre renter candidates , all of whom reno and holly unsurprisingly find unsuitable for living along with them in their house they , unknown to each other , each select a renter of the opposite sex , with the lovers manifestly cool toward the choice of their partner . the newcomers ( chad and nicole ) would seem to have little discernible point to their existence other than highly aural fornication with a broad range of partners , and it is not long before jealousy mars the harmonic relationship of reno and holly . reno is bent upon patenting and merchandising a type of sporting travel bag and , as he has given an engagement ring to holly , the potential success of this entrepreneurial adventure is of great financial significance if he intends to advance his marital plan . unfortunately , the rapacious team of chad and nicole , whose every action is ostensibly laced with lust , is likely to disrupt any future wedding intentions of reno . direction is slack , plainly far from fulfilling basic needs of the players , although an erratically composed script provides scant material with which actors may work , and ad libbing falls embarrassingly flat . as a result , the performances are undistinguished , not aided by spotty editing , while the manner of camera-work changes as abruptly and often as a firefly ' s tail light . filmed with a low budget and on location , only a modicum of skill is required for the designing processes , but a larger measure of value might have been placed upon the tasteless d . j . background soundtrack , generally blaring and nearly always invasive . a good deal of discussion has been stimulated by the movie ' s final sequences that are apparently not expected by a viewer based upon what has come before , but in reality these comprise probably the only thoughtful portions of a poorly cobbled screenplay , and bids fair to make the work almost watchable , despite the shabby quality of the production as a whole .  this is supposed to be the story of the life of a man named wirey spindell from age 8 through to 36 told in narrative by the character at each age point in his life . so for example , when he ' s eight , it ' s the eight year old ' s voice that is doing the narration ; when he ' s in junior high , it ' s that one doing the narration , etc . that ' s about the only interesting thing about this movie . it looks like each actor playing wirey is a separate character . not only do they not look alike , their life experiences don ' t seem to match up . 

avoid this movie like a bad cold .  i enjoyed carax ' s " les amants du pont neuf " and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard . well , the first 10 minutes were ok , but then it disintegrates into a rather pretentious journey of a young man looking for the essence of life . a sad disappointment .  imagine a gilligan ' s island set in the african desert in modern times . add people nowhere near as jaunty as the skipper or marianne--and enough angst to fill a german psychiatrist ' s office . throw in a plot that manages to be interesting only episodically and literary parallelism that never delves deeply enough to truly satisfy . season with a truly morose topic that ' s been exploited since the first world travelers found themselves very , very lost . 

if the king is alive weren ' t a product of the reigning czars du jour of dogme 95 , would this film be garnering as much attention ? dogme 95 is to hollywood as danish modern is to rococo . a byproduct of digital technology , this scandinavian movement seeks--quite dogmatically--to strip away artificiality in film-making , by using more natural elements and returning to the essence of storytelling . pearl harbor , for instance , is the dogme antichrist . 

director / co-author kristian levring ' s saga ponders interpersonal relations and human nature when placed under the fire of a life-threatening situation . eleven people aboard a bus riding through the namibian sand dunes suddenly find themselves stranded in the remains of an abandoned town . an african local who does not speak their language serves as observer and narrator ( whose insights are among the film ' s most trenchant ) . as the strongest heads off for a five-day walk to the nearest village , the others stay behind , surviving on dented-canned carrots and circumambulating their likely future as vulture chow . former thespian henry decides that this rather unappealing crew needs a diversion , and hand-writes king lear from memory . he assigns roles , and the group passes many days learning lines and rehearsing , in an effort to divert their attention from the seemingly inevitable . 

gradually the cast begins to lose it , and the savageries of their natureÂor , william golding might say , human natureÂbegin to surface . if you ' ve ever seen lord of the flies , you know that these things can get ugly , that being in a lifeboat situation can turn even mother teresa into the pmsing termagant of calcutta . 

the film was shot using an international ensemble of american , english , french and south african actors , who , the dogme dogma dictates , develop themselves and their roles quite organically . the king was also filmed chronologically , adding a sense of realism to the ever-increasing desperation of its characters . after up to three hand-held cameras shot in digital , results were transferred to 35mm film . 

the performance that compels most comes from jennifer jason leigh , who plays a boho pop tart trying to bolster the spirits of the group in any and every way she can . henry ( david bradley ) is another finely played character , whose passion for his life ' s work ultimately saves the gang from utter despair . it ' s hard to feel too sorry for the othersÂcruel wives and their oafish husbands , hirsute old womanizers , sulky french intellectuals , wealthy men who have more important places to be than marooned in the namibian desert . beckett might hate this question , but why is this group riding a bus together through remote africa in the first place ? life-threatening morbidity ! utter despair rendered in graphic detail ! a relentlessly tedious pace ! enjoy .  the cast and crew of this cheap horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that occurs throughout the movie itself ; we have barbara payton , raymond burr , lon chaney jr . , tom conway , paul cavanaugh and woody strode in front of the camera and writer-director curt siodmak , cinematographer charles van enger , editorial supervisor francis d . lyon and production assistant herman cohen behind it . the ill-fated payton turns the head of virtually every male she comes in contact with deep in the african jungle where she lives on husband cavanaugh ' s plantation : doctor conway secretly desires her while hot-headed foreman burr ' s approach is , quite literally , more hands-on . on the other hand , chaney is ( surprisingly enough ) the laid-back but knowing authoritarian figure and strode is a native police official . the plot is very simple but , frankly , does not make a whole lot of sense : after a particularly agitated dinner complete with thunderstorm , burr and cavanaugh ( art imitating life Â more on that later ) come to blows in the garden over their affection for payton and , conveniently for burr , a large snake just happens to be crawling near where cavanaugh hits the ground ! witnessing the event from behind the bushes , payton ' s enigmatic maid ( a native witch , no less ) , for some inexplicable reason , puts a curse on burr ( who has in the meantime married payton ) that periodically turns him into a gorilla . . . starting from his very wedding day ( when his hand briefly turns hirsute ) ! consequently , burr takes to losing himself in the jungle for days on end Â even if the ape creature itself is barely glimpsed throughout the film . it must be said , however , that the version that i watched ran for just 56 minutes when the ' official ' length is elsewhere given as either 66 , 70 or 76 ! ! therefore , the film feels understandably rushed and disjointed if never less than campily enjoyable as it culminates in the gorilla ' s subjectively-shot chasing of payton in the jungle , with the former being itself pursued by the gun-toting chaney and conway . to get back to the film ' s tragic blonde leading lady for a minute : after a promising start in movies next to such hollywood legends as james cagney and gary cooper Â in , respectively , kiss tomorrow goodbye and dallas ( both 1950 ) Â her career soon nose-dived into b ( and lesser ) grade territory thanks to her own ' colorful ' off-screen antics : her most notorious misdemeanor was being the cause of a much-publicized bar-room brawl between suave husband franchot tone and brutish former lover tom neal which ended with the former in a coma and payton actually deserting him for the latter shortly thereafter ! ! but that was not all : nymphomaniac payton also boasted that woody strode was among her conquests ( a controversial issue at the time ) ; short-lived husband tone , having caught payton ' s infidelities on camera , spread the damning photographic evidence around hollywood and this virtually served to end her days as a starlet Â her last film appearance being edgar g . ulmer ' s murder is my beat ( 1955 ) which i happen to have in my " unwatched movies " pile . the last 12 years of her tumultuous life were spent on skid row in the throes of booze , drugs , prostitution , beatings , arrests and even a stabbing Â before , eventually , dying in 1967 in her parents ' home at the young age of 39 !  i am a massive fan of the log . i thought the first two series provided some of the best comedy this country has ever seen and the third series , though different , was wonderfully dark and imaginative . the thought of seeing tubbs , edward and briss on the big screen made july 3 something to wait for . yet , somewhere , it all went horribly wrong . the writers had no story and no real ideas . the part set in old england showed the glimmers of genius that we know the league are capable of but these scenes did not fit well with the film . geoff provided the best of too few , largely poor jokes and lipp and briss ' s performances were big let-downs . if you love the league , save yourself the time and money and watch episodes from the tv series again . and again . a massive disappointment .  you belong to me was the final teaming of henry fonda and barbara stanwyck as a screen team and it was a loan out film for fonda to columbia pictures . fonda had signed a contract with 20th century fox in order to get the tom joad part in the grapes of wrath . but after that it was usually his loan out films that were good while he was cast in mediocre things at fox . 

but the rule was broken here . though the character he plays bears some superficial resemblance to charles pike from the lady eve , this film isn ' t anywhere near as funny . in fact feminists would probably be aghast at it . 

in fact barbara stanwyck herself didn ' t like it at all . she liked working with henry fonda right enough , but thought this film was ridiculous . as well she should have . 

fonda is another millionaire playboy , who we would now call a trust fund baby who doesn ' t really do much with his life . he ' s sort of lovable lunkhead who meets stanwyck on a ski slope and literally falls for her trying to show off . turns out she ' s a doctor and they have a whirlwind courtship and get married . 

but it turns out fonda has a jealous streak , especially when it involves roger clark , another millionaire patient of stanwyck ' s . and he ' s not understanding as to her professional obligations . 

stanwyck , like bette davis and katharine hepburn , was and is a feminist icon . when she tells fonda that he ought to go out in the working world and live on a salary and see if he can do it , fonda goes out and gets a job as a salesman in a department store . she ' s so proud of him , that she actually is going to give up her medical practice and live with him on his salesman ' s salary . 

today now would be picketing the film . stanwyck did not have too much conviction in her performance , probably because she didn ' t believe any of it . i certainly couldn ' t . 

i don ' t think even back then audiences believed it either . but the two stars and the rest of the cast tried their best , but this one was a thanksgiving special .  i am a big fan of " auntie mame " with rosalind russell . she really was the perfect actress to play that character . 

i ' ve heard angela lansbury was very good on stage in " mame " but it ' s hard to imagine anyone topping rosalind russell . 

lucy was such a great comedienne that her comic bits salvaged her performance in this movie where i think she was miscast really , they should have dubbed her singing voice - hearing these songs sung at a faster tempo and with strong voices really changes the whole effect . 

i just saw the stage revival in washington d . c . and i think christine baranski was very good as mame , harriet harris - the nasty chain smoking agent on frasier - played vera and she was particularly good . 

both would be good casting for a tv movie of this show . maybe if that production makes it to broadway they ' ll consider filming it . 

also i think tracy ullman would be good as agnes .  cultural vandalism is the new hallmark production of gulliver ' s travels an act of cultural vandalism ? not literally . after all , not a single copy of the book is burned . but if this is the only gulliver people are exposed toÂand to many it will beÂthose people will not get anything like what jonathan swift intended . were jonathan swift alive , hallmark could be sued for moral rights violations and they ' d lose . that ' s a good way to think before starting a project using someone else ' s ideas . 

swift ' s masterpiece is an extraordinary vision of humanity . through his hero , gulliver , he travels to places that make him feel big , small , shat on and human . the little people in lilleput are small in every way . petty and stupid , they fight , the big-enders and little- enders , interminable wars of annihilation over which end of their soft-boiled eggs are opened at the breakfast table . sounds a bit like us . 

i forget most of the rest : it ' s been years since i read it . the tv show reminded me of a few things and , on the bright side , it made me want to read it again . 

this gift to mankind has been shat on , like gulligan under the boughs beneath the vulgar yahoos , and danson , steenbergen and especially two great actors , peter o ' toole and edward fox , ought to be thoroughly ashamed . some " creative person " got the bright idea to put the focus on " the star : " gulliver , played by ted danson , whose acting is just plain bad . he portrays gulliver as insane . all his travels were made up . weeeeel . yeeeaaah ! of course swift made up gulliver ! naturally , the lands he visited were imaginary : that ' s called fiction . his purpose was to talk about humankind and our , often awful , relations with each other . the travels of his imaginary character to imaginary lands is his method . but these people treat imagination as a disease and anyone who has a moment that hallmark couldn ' t turn into one of its anodyne cards is suspect . 

i can sure see why hallmark would produce this crap . it ' s so bad that o ' toole , always profound , seems as little as his lilliputian character . he ' s in character , of course , while commenting on the character simultaneously , as many , if not all great actors do . informing the character sheds light on it . our light completes the character . it becomes three dimensional through this act of psychic triangulation . most actors do this very subtly , like hopkins in " the remains of the day . " others , like nicholson , in most things in the last twenty years , play the two parts pretty broadly apart . nicholson actually plays on the relationship of his two points and with us too : with him it ' s all cat ' s cradle and he , chuckling away , holds all the strings . great fun , as is o ' toole . but something here is lacking . he is shouting into a megaphone ( as great as ever ) and all one senses is a hollow shell standing under him . 

that ' s because it is . look up " anodyne " and there ought to be the word " hallmark " as a synonym . harmless , bland , inoffensive : hallmark is the doll who can ' t pee because she has no genitals : it is the norm , the average , the person of no distinction . hallmark ' s hallmark is to have no hallmark . i never suspected that such people despise those who have imagination quite so much . suddenly , pound ' s " disney against the meta-physicals " stands out in bold type . or einstein ' s " men of genius always will be violently opposed by mediocre minds . " indeed , anyone , to this mediocre type , who has an answer to any question other than " a ) " or " b ) " is suspect . who more distinctive then that a man who journeys to the darker places of the human soul and shines his little flashlight to illuminate what can be found there ? hence the act of vandalism . the taliban destroyed the buddhas in afghanistan , the palestinians the oldest synagogue in the world at jericho , the barbarians the great statuary of the classical age and these things are obviously vandalism . hallmark endeavors to protect us from foreign foes by undermining our own culture ; the one that feeds and sustains them . and us . 

please buy a copy of gulliver ' s travels wherever you live , and read it . or order it online . i like to use abe books .  the most irritating thing about " dies d ' agost " ( august days ) is not simply that nothing happens in this film but that director marc recha has the nerve to pretend that this film is some sort of homage to leftist catalan journalist ramon barnils . unless mentioning barnils ' name a few times constitutes an " homage , " this pretense is an utter fraud . you will learn virtually nothing about barnils in this film nor about the spanish civil war ( 1936-1939 ) nor about the special role of catalunya in that war . you also will not learn about the collective punishment inflicted on the heroic catalan people for years afterward by the victorious and vindictive franco . 

the footage of the catalan countryside is very beautiful , of course , but " dies d ' agost " does not have an extensive and varied enough collection of such scenes to qualify as a travelogue . the large number of stills shown -- not very illuminating images of the forest floor , for example -- is the clearest indication of the paucity of ideas here . the aimless drift of brothers marc and david during their camping trip does not produce compelling cinema . on the contrary , one ' s strongest impression is of a film made by and for spaced-out , middle-aged hippies . don ' t waste your time . read a good book about the spanish civil war instead . ( i recommend felix morrow ' s scathingly anti-stalinist " revolution and counter-revolution in spain , " which contains a gripping account of the 1937 barcelona uprising . ) 

barry freed question : how does a film merit two different titles like " the librarians " and " strike force " ? 

answer : the film is sooooooooo bad that the filmmakers couldn ' t even decide on a title ! ! ! ! 

this film is a hodgepodge of martial arts , death wish-vendettas , melodrama , romance , and other clichÃ© film techniques . the story focuses on a vigilante group called the librarians led by agent simon ( william forsythe ) . the group is hot in pursuit of a nefarious , multi-lingual , pockmarked creature named marcos ( andrew divoff ) who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of south florida . 

burt reynolds appears as a cameo in this film , and his scene is entirely extraneous to the action . burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest drawls i have ever heard . this may have been burt ' s attempt at an irish dialect , but the overall effect is a kind of perverse imitation of marlon brando in " the godfather . " 

also appearing in this film is erika eleniak , who has infiltrated the inner circle of marcos ' bizarre world . erika ' s character kick-boxes her way into an alliance with simon . the librarians and erika will become a powerful strike force against evil in a film that has been delivered directly from the editing room to your cable tv converter box .  overall , the movie " heart of darkness " was pitiful compared to the book . anyone who has ever read the book and had a sufficient understanding of it would be able to see the countless obvious flaws . there is an immeasurable difference between the two . it seems to me that the director was walking into a losing battle . i couldn ' t imagine that someone would take on the monstrous task of recreating " heart of darkness . " the immense detail and magic of the story would be impossible to justly interpret . conrad ' s story had so many layers and so much depth that it would seem pointless to try to make a visual interpretation . 

first , capturing the details of the story is unattainable . the colossal fine points created by joseph conrad cannot be rightfully recreated through film . marlow ' s feelings and emotions cannot be equally construed in the movie . if you have taken on the enormous task of tackling conrad ' s work then , you know as well as i that conrad only wrote half the story . the additional half is a series of connections made by the reader . you , as the reader are required to be capable of inferring and connecting joseph conrad ' s ideas . as a result , several crucial details are absent in the movie . 

also , although the movie was an adequate length , the film seemed short . it seemed that conrad was able to pack many more details into 75 pages than the movie could pack in an hour and a half . the speed of the movie kept the viewer from getting to know the characters . marlow was much more of a stranger . the viewpoint of the book puts you into marlow ' s shoes . however , in the movie , you ' re almost watching marlow from a distance . i began to think that the director was trying to utilize the same " read between the lines " method as conrad did . however , the connections were weak . i know that if i had not read the book then , i would , in no way , be able to begin to understand the depth of the situation and the characters . 

finally , kurtz also seemed to be interpreted incorrectly . his role was short and the details weren ' t all included . it was impossible to comprehend the true kurtz in the length of time he was shown . an important detail in the book was that kurtz had become a god to the africans . i didn ' t think that significant detail was defined . also , in the book , kurtz represented a soulless being . he had died inside long ago . i believe the director comprehended this detail . however , instead of recreating it , he just had kurtz mope around and mumble everything . moreover , it seemed like the director attempted to make kurtz seem mysterious , however , instead , he seemed entirely unidentified . 

altogether , this movie reminded me of a teenager cramming to finish a science project , due the next day . it appeared to have been crafted effortlessly and in hardly any time . the characters were alienated , crucial details were left out , and , overall , the central plot was lost in translation .  i kind of like jag . it do have itÂ´s charm but lately itÂ´s to much propaganda in it . for an outsider ( a non american ) the patriotic feeling can be a bit to much . 

i donÂ´t like that rabb and mackenzie goes from being lawyers ( as they were in the early parts of the tv show ) to become super heros that stops wars and rescues entire continents . its almost like watching a recruitment video from the us army . 

i still watch the show , so itÂ´s not that bad . but i would prefer more episodes when rabb and mackenzie investigates military accidents and donÂ´t save the world in the future .  i ' m rather surprised that anybody found this film touching or moving . 

the basic premise of the film sounded to me like an excellent , if provocative , idea for a movie about a rare sort of relationship , but one ( if i can judge by the real-life examples i ' ve known ) is extremely deep and loving . 

however , the film is cheaply scripted--poorly scripted--and although it has a number of very pretty-looking shots , i didn ' t find it to be anything special . 

probably the biggest problem is that it is far too short and poorly-composed to give its audience time enough to invest , emotionally , in the characters : we don ' t really care about any of them , and so their stresses and obstacles don ' t really touch us . 

i think a remake--from the screenplay up--with some character development by some really good writers--could improve it greatly . it is instructive to compare this film with brokeback mountain , which the screen-writers took to far loftier levels than did the author of the screenplay--screen-writers who were clearly conscious of how to write a classical tragedy , and carried out their task with care , planning , and superb craftsmanship ! however , people only seem to remake those films that don ' t need it ! you ' re not really missing anything if you skip this one : i found it very disappointing indeed , and it is only saved from getting a 1-star from me by virtue of the daring and gumption it took to make a film on this sensitive subject .  big fat slob ' uncle buck ' , played by john ( eats-a-lot-of ) candy , visits the sane members of his family for a week in order to baby-sit two cute kids ( gaby hoffman and maccauley culkin ) and a pretty but snobby teenager ( jean louisa kelly ) . the shenanigans begin when buck makes breakfast and then tries to sleep in a bed two sizes too small for his blimp of a body . 

mostly dull , but peppered with two or three funny scenes including buck trying to get a word in edge-wise on the telephone with his angry girlfriend ( amy madigan ) and his meeting with a very disgusting clown . 

candy looks like he weighs 600 pounds .  eugene o ' neill is acclaimed by some as america ' s leading playwright , but for things like the iceman cometh , long day ' s journey into night , the emperor jones . strange interlude was a piece of experimentation he concocted where the characters on stage , look aside to the audience and say what they really are thinking and then resume conversation . it was a nine hour production with a dinner break on broadway , so you can safely assume a lot has been sacrificed here . 

for the screen the voice over regarding the thoughts is used for all the characters . it probably is a technique better suited to the screen . sir laurence olivier did very well with it in his version of hamlet . but bill shakespeare gave olivier a lot better story than o ' neill gave his players in this instance . 

players like clark gable , norma shearer , ralph morgan , may robson , etc . are a lot more animated in most of their films than they are in strange interlude . the story takes place over a 20 year period . norma shearer is a young woman whose intended is killed in world war i . she starts playing around quite a bit , although that part is not shown in this version . she makes the acquaintance of alexander kirkland and his friend clark gable . she also has as a perennial suitor , ralph morgan , a friend of her father ' s henry b . walthall . 

she marries kirkland , but then is warned by his mother may robson and shown that insanity gallops in that family to quote another literary work . since kirkland wants kids and shearer and robson think kirkland ' s train will slip the track if he doesn ' t get one , gable is recruited for breeding purposes . of course you can see all the complications this can cause and o ' neill explores them all . 

gable is so terribly miscast in an o ' neill production , but he was an up and coming player at mgm and did what they told him . shearer does what she can to lift a very dreary story , but she seems defeated at the start . best in the film is possibly robson who puts some real bite in her dialog . 

strange interlude ran for 426 showings on broadway in 1928-1929 and starred glenn anders and lynn fontanne in the gable and shearer parts . perhaps no one could really have saved the film because two years earlier , groucho marx lampooned the stuffings out of it in animal crackers . after seeing what he did , i don ' t think the movie going public took it too seriously . 

and since it ' s not the best of o ' neill , neither could i .  overambitious and shoddy ; and at times too darkly lit . dark reality ' s scenario is not even close to being original . dark and dank basement . kidnapped prisoners . fearful survival . carey ( alisha seton ) tells her family and friends she will be backpacking across europe . she doesn ' t make it out of town . she is grabbed from a rainy sidewalk , drugged , and awakes chained in a dungeon . she eventually realizes she is not alone and upon meeting a few of her fellow captives there is different thoughts on survival . her cell mates start dying off one by one . can she garner enough strength and courage to see daylight again ? others in the cast : laila dagher , rachel oliva , eva derreck , arthur bullock and jen parker .  if this movie had a point i never discovered it . a very depressing movie which supposedly is about the final evacuation of the residents living in a dam site area on the northfork river in montana . the problem is that there is no actual northfork river in montana . there are several north forks but they are branches of other rivers which divided into north and south forks . 

	the opening scene of the movie is a coffin bobbing to the surface of the lake but the scene is never tied into the story and the viewer is left to speculate as to its meaning . but much is left to the viewer ' s speculation in the movie . another example is when a team of dam employees responsible for the evacuation of the residents arrives at the dam headquarters , another group of people are departing . some remark which is almost inaudible is made about these people which makes no sense whatsoever and there is no followup in the movie to explain it . 

	the movie is butchered into several stories and the film keeps switching back and forth between stories which is quite disconcerting . and the stories are weird . in one of them the occupants of one property refuse to be evacuated because they are living in a home that is built like noah ' s ark . 

	another senseless story centers around a sick orphan who is dying and somehow he is sharing his presence with a house full of ghosts and in an orphanage with a priest at the same time . if anyone can figure out what the ghost story was about the author must have explained it to them . 

	the scenery was stark and the sun never shines . there are snowy mountains in the far distance . i guess the purpose was to set the mood . the time period is set by the fact that the evacuaters all drove ford sedans of the 1946-48 era although the events are supposed to have occurred in 1955 . the acting was mediocre . when i saw the billing for this movie it said that darryl hannah was in the picture . if she was , i didn ' t recognize her but i surmise that she was the ghost lady .  danny lee ' s performance as a wisecracking cop is the only spot of interest in this film , even though it has an excellent cast including chow yun-fat , carina lau , andy lau , shing fui-on and alex man . cyf plays a triad boss who wants to settle down to a life of peace and plenty but alex man , a total psycho who has a big grudge against cyf , won ' t let him . cyf tries to escape to malacca but to no avail . after his family is blown to bits , his cronies dead or turncoat , wounded and broke , cyf returns to hong kong to get into some serious revenge . 

it sounds a lot better than it is . cyf is well-dressed and handsome , looks pained , grimaces and cries on cue , but somehow or another you just don ' t care . andy lau looks great , but that ' s about it . carina lau has a tiny , tiny little part which was nice , but she gets a bullet in the head early on so that ends that . alex man is a cartoon villain he ' s so over-the-top which at times can be intriguing but the writing here is so flat that he just comes across as a garden-variety nut . 

danny lee is great though - too bad he ' s only a small blip on the screen of this dark ( literally ) and essentially boring movie . 

rent it , don ' t buy it . or just skip it altogether . 

this is the sequel to " rich and famous " , even though it apparently was filmed simultaneously ; it was released first because of cyf ' s boxoffice power .  just listen to the broadway cast album and to the voices of barbara harris and john cullum , who do wonders for the wonderful lerner and lane score . then , with that beautiful cast recording fresh in mind , watch the movie , with streisand as streisand , and yves montand reading his lines with such a heavy french accent that a chain saw couldn ' t cut through it . the best part ( for those who need something to look forward to ) is what montand does to the introductory part of the title song . listen as he sings / says : could anyone among us have an inkling or a clue , what magic feats of wizardry and voodoo you can do ? ( that one part sums up the problem that results from casting " name stars " in movie musicals instead of the appropriate talent for the various roles . ) i can just see rex harrison entering that scene and suggesting montand , too , could learn to do justice to the beauty of the english language . 

 your ability to enjoy the ashes of time may depend on our expectations before stepping into the theater . even its most strident supporters seem to agree that audiences can be split right up the middle in their appreciation of this unique film . 

unlike most hk actioners , the battle scenes are curiously kept at a distance . when they do happen , they ' re rendered in a jerky style in which it ' s difficult to make out exactly what ' s occurring on screen . the dramatic scenes can be extravagantly beautiful , with the of maggie cheung , brigitte lin , and a roll-call of hk ' s top acting talent chewing up the scenery . as with some of wong kar-wai ' s early work , the dialog could be more precise . 

in short , the ashes of time requires a forgiving attitude . released around the same time as wong kar-wai ' s spectacularly successful chungking express , it ' s clear that the director isn ' t as confident working with the elements of the martial arts film . anyone looking for tense action is likely to be disappointed . but those intrigued by the director ' s aesthetic will likely find this a unique experience at the very least .  i am not quite sure i agree with the director of this version of the scarlet pimpernel . i imagined sir percy blakeney a very calm , seemingly lazy aristocrat . this particular sir percy blakeney appears to be teeming with overwhelming energy and volatility . i did not appreciate the houdini , james bond , mission impossible style escapes that sir percy engineered either . in the previous versions , wit was the tool for escape , not technology . neither were the characters of marguerite and chauvelin adequately portrayed . there seemed to be little energy or chemistry in the interaction between the characters . 

i do not wish to assign any blame , for perhaps the reason for my dislike of this movie might simply be a matter of difference in interpretation . had the director ' s interpretation coincided with mine , perhaps i might not have been irritated by what seemed to me bad character portrayals . 

i much preferred the version from 1982 . anthony andrews was quite efficient as the imperturbable , calm fop . so were jane seymour and ian mckellen . in my opinion , the style of this period piece seems to have been lost with this latest adaption . i recommend sticking with the previous versions , either the one from 1934 or the one from 1982 . 

 this film captures the short moments between a mother and son in rural russia , as she lays dying . 

i am so torn between being nice to the film or declaring it a test of patience . on one hand , the film is beautiful , with the sparse dialog capturing the essence of their feelings . there is really nothing to say , because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words . the son shows so much care , love and patience towards his mother , that i think it is a celebration of unconditional love towards one ' s family . it also cruelly reminds me that i could be in a situation like this , stuck in a joyless place , having to take care of a very ill person . " mat i syn " is cruel reality . 

on the other hand , " mat i syn " moves really too slowly . do i really need to watch a train passing by the horizon for over 1 minute ? with my previous experience of " telets " and " aleksandra " , i am so tempted to put " mat i syn " among them as a total bore . 

i guess one has to be in the right state of mind to appreciate this film . i surely see the beauty of it , but maybe i am not in the right state of mind .  having lived in michigan ' s upper peninsula ( 30 miles from escanaba ) in the mid-1990s , i was eager to see this film . it begins promisingly enough , with some superficial understanding of the values and quirks of u . p . life . but jeff daniels apparently was not content with a low-key approach that would have been fitting given the place and the people . instead , he introduces extremely crude humor and some wildly inappropriate mystical / supernatural elements . although there is a good movie to be made about this practically unknown region of the u . s . , this is not it .  alain resnais directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world . in one of them is a sort of operatic bordello story where a rejected architect attempts to manipulate a group of people into throes of happiness--only his attempt misses it ' s only real target , the woman that he pines after . in the same unfinished chÃ¢teau he built , a group of teachers search for love in a more modern story , as one woman believes ineffably in the role of romance and the cynical anthropoligist tries to teach her a lesson by setting her up with the biggest jerk in the group . meanwhile , a bunch of kids fantasize a george melies-like adventure of a prince that saves a girl in distress from swamp creatures and then kills the evil king , bringing upon the kingdom of love . the two primary themes ? life is a fairy tale , and life isn ' t a fairy tale . 

which sounds better than the movie actually is . resnais is the type of director where oftentimes the concept is good or bad , but the exposition is what matters ; here , the concept is great but the movie is downright painful to watch . horridly off-tune songs , bubbly characters without an ounce of dimension , backdrops of sickening pastel--instead of giving your inner child an ice cream cone , resnais drowns it in a bucket of cake frosting . add some french philosophy and you get a weird witches brew , one that doesn ' t bubble bubble toil and trouble , but just kinda sits wrong in your stomach until you want to regurgitate it . 

resnais is a risk-taking director , and even in his worst you can see he ' s trying something that might not work with full clarity of action . in i want to go home , he manages to pull past annoying characters and ditzy set-pieces by showing some real change and having a moment few moments of quiet to catch his breath . here he submerges directly into a fantasy that doesn ' t really reflect fantasy , only its baby ' s room wallpaper reference . the biggest problem is that he somehow managed to make a movie more flamboyant than an 80s pop video , and more kitsch than golden era hollywood musicals . the fantasies are beyond childish and naive , but the movie ( with nudity and profanity ) is definitely aimed for adults , a target he decidedly missed . 

however , he sticks closely to his theme and never backpedals . if anything , this movie is impressive simply because its unapologetic . 

--polarisdib i found this to be a tremendously disappointing version of a charming story . i thought the acting was on the whole quite good . reginald owen did chew the scenery , as mentioned by others , but i found him moderately amusing in his brief scenes . tcm has made an ann harding fan of me , and i thought she was fine as usual here . jessie ralph had a field day as the old battleaxe , ordering everybody around , and frank morgan , as always , played frank morgan with a twinkle . 

for me , the problem was the script and / or the editing--transitions were awkward , motivations were murky . the movie was just too darned short to convey the story properly ! i felt completely let down , particularly since i had such fond memories of the later version .  the film , heaven ' s gate , was a good view , although still tedious at over 4 hours . but the film took great license - as usual with hollywood . james averill ( chris christopherson ) , and " elle " were actually married in real life . their main contribution to the johnson county war , was to start it by being hanged . well , by starting it , i mean it came at the beginning , not the end . here ' s the real scenario : james averill and ellen watson were secretly married because one homestead could be given to each family . by filing as single individuals , they could get two homesteads . they chose homesites on crazy woman creek actually controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the cattleman ' s association . he offered to buy them out repeatedly , which they refused . 

although characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel ( cattle kate ) , and a prostitute herself ( and also in the film ) , there is no real evidence that was true . it is known that she bought many head of sick cattle , nursed them back to life , and was later accused by the cattleman ' s association of receiving the cattle in trade for " lewd acts ' . in the end , she was accused of rustling - an act almost certainly untrue . so much for this part of the myth of the " american west " , which is a gooble-de-gook of myths spanning a time period of about one hundred years . 

in real life , she and jim averill were surprised one day by several members of the cattleman ' s association , taken in hand , and promptly hanged . those perpetrating the injustice were never brought to trial . but that was the first link that led to the murder of nate champion , and the start of the johnson county war . 

quite different from the hollywood version which shows her shot at the end . 

other than that , i think the main problem with the film was the editor , who could have made the action a faster pace by more skillful editing .  mr . moto ' s gamble has a fairly straight forward plot - when a boxer is murdered in the ring with a mysterious poison , it ' s up to the even more mysterious mr . moto to solve the case . 

i ' m shocked at the number of positive reviews for mr . moto ' s gamble on imdb . because to me . . . well , i found it extremely disappointing . i enjoy mr . moto and i enjoy charlie chan , but i can ' t say i cared for this mish-mash of the two . for those unfamiliar with the story behind mr . moto ' s gamble , it was originally intended to be a charlie chan film . but when warner oland backed-out , some of the scenes and action were rewritten for peter lorre and mr . moto . as i indicated , the end result left me underwhelmed . mr . moto is not chan . he ' s more mysterious , he ' s more athletic , and he ' s more exotic . so trying to put moto in a chan film is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole - it doesn ' t work . and listening to lorre / moto try to deliver one of chan ' s trademark euphemisms just ends up sounding silly . add to that the fact that almost 10 minutes of the already brief 72 minute runtime is made up of boxing scenes ( something that i never seem to enjoy ) and you end up with a movie that i couldn ' t help but dislike . if i have to say something positive i would point to the performance of keye luke . but even he ' s not near enough to save mr . moto ' s gamble in my eyes . 

sorry , but a 4 / 10 is about the best i can give this one .  i am a longtime fan of the original of this movie ( bella martha / mostly martha ) , and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one . i miss the slow pace , the build-up of characters and their style in small gestures , the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog . i don ' t think that the story itself is enough . martha / kate is more secluded , and mario / nick is not a clown . in most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original , its is not working in its copy here . the small alterations take away the tension . my opinion is that you should go and see the original . it ' ll worth the inconvenience of subtitles .  the 1973 " day of the jackal " , directed by fred zinnemann from the frederick forsyth novel , while not a masterpiece in the general scheme of things , was nevertheless quite an above-average thriller , written and carried out with considerable panache , wit , and style . it remains a pleasure to rent and watch now and then . 

in adapting that for the 1997 " the jackal " , it seems that at every turn the writers and director made the worst possible choice , making it all quite leaden , overdone , unsuspenseful , unsurprising , unsexy , and unthrilling . if we put together a catalog of all the specifics that went into this movie , big and small , i could give you a mini-essay for each topic on how the 1997 adaptation * * * * ed up . 

item : the weapon . 

in the original , there is considerable intrigue over how the assassin is going to smuggle it onto the scene , how he intends to disguise it , and why it needs custom work from his underground craftsmen . in the remake , they apparently thought that today ' s action-flick-raised audiences wouldn ' t tolerate a small rifle whose point is precision and would demand the lugubrious off-the-[black-market-]shelf machine gun , which needs a minivan to transport it , and whose point is to shout macho . the whole involved and interesting business about disguising its components , has been reduced to showing us ( repeatedly , like this is a difficult point to follow ? ) that the joystick for his absurdly high-tech remote-control system has been in his pocket as a pen . 

item : the conspirators and motive . 

without resorting to dry lecture , the original still manages to give us a good understanding of the historical situation of the " pieds-noirs " [ " blackfeet " ] , the french-algerian irredentists who could not accept that the century was moving away from colonialism , and formed the view that de gaulle had betrayed them . this gives the whole plot some historical weight . the remake seems to leave it as a gangland-shootout revenge story , minimally spicing it up by making them russian gangsters . note please that i ' m not opposed to updating : they could have done this intelligently and come up with something more current but non-trivial . certainly russia and the rest of ex-ussr have been through huge changes of late , and an updated story could have been situated there in a way that would make us feel that it * matters * . 

item : the relationship of the assassin on the run and the police hunting him down ; and the complex steering of the viewer ' s sympathies from the bad guy to the good guy . 

above i hesitated somewhat at calling the original a masterpiece overall ; but in this aspect it really was one . we follow along with the assassin for much of the first portions of the film , and having seen his cleverness and resourcefulness we begin to admire him , and not want to see his plan thwarted or see him caught -- at least , not too soon ! then we meet the policeman who gets pushed into heading up the investigation / protection efforts , and bit-by-bit we take to him , and see he is not the sad-sack his domestic troubles may have suggested . by the time it matters , we have been won over to his side . 

in the remake , perhaps poitier could have handled that sort of development , but gere sure can ' t . and the absurd " 48 hours " -derived gimmick of the con brought out to help the police should have been left in those comedies where it came from . 

the remake has the assassin and the assassin-hunter * talk * about how they ' re like players above a chessboard , communicating indirectly via their moves and only able to * infer * what the other is like . that was achieved superbly in the original . but in the remake in fact they ' re brought into face-to-face confrontation way too soon , so they can grimace at each other , bloody the place up , and go through some fairly standard chase scenes . 

item : photography , and " scenery " . 

the remake does have some nice images , particularly in snowy finland in the opening section . but the washington , d . c metro cannot really compete with the streets of paris for interesting perspectives and bystander faces .  all in all , don ' t expect much and you won ' t be disappointed . 

and if you want to see a movie that will take you back to 1983 , this will do that for sure . the only reason i gave this movie 2 points more than it deserves is for 2 reasons : 

 # 1 . michael caine

 # 2 . the people , the sights , the culture and the music of brazil 

the movie is almost completely carried by caine as he commits the seemingly impossible task of transforming it into a viable and semi-believable story . even joe bologna and valerie harper fall short . 

michael caine is pure class , as always . besides being a gifted classical and comic actor , caine brings a blend of introspection , mischievousness and sensitivity to every movie he does . . . the focus of his charm as far back as his role in alfie . . . and the reason why he won the academy award for hannah and her sisters 2 years later . in this farce , he is tenderly beguiling . . . funny and vulnerable . . . melancholy and sentimental . . . . and besides the jewel that is rio de janeiro , the only reason to not seek out a better form of entertainment . 

well . . . maybe a glimpse at the 2 lovely young actresses , michelle johnson and demi moore would be a reason . but look is all you can do at michelle ( though her look seems sorely dated ) . . . . there couldn ' t be a more painful movie experience than watching her " try " to act ( most of her dialogue seems overdubbed , too ) . demi ' s acting and looks hold up 100 times better and you could easily transplant her , as is , into any movie today ( she doesn ' t really look much different to be honest ) . ms . moore is surely underused , especially considering she was the bigger star of the 2 . 

save the fact that it is a silly farce , at the end , i actually kind of like the maturity with which all these people handle this scandalous situation . . . that it doesn ' t end friendships nor marriages and that an affair , even with the underage daughter of your best friend , could be forgiven and everyone can move on . the injured parties do show anger and disappointment at what transpired , but all works out for the best . . . . a bit unrealistic for sure , but surprisingly refreshing . hope always is .  i ' m not surprised that this film did well at the hamptons film festival . it is a shallow film that would appeal well to shallow people . two actors pretending to be actors in a relationship who fight and look for a lost dog . the film is allegedly exploring the dynamics of the relationship , however , the relationship is far too petty to merit any such exploration . this couple has one dimension : they fight , they tease , then they make love and fight some more . there brief moment of tenderness does not reveal any possible reason that these two would be involved with each other given their venomous and volatile relationship . beautifully shot , excellent score , but without anything of merit in the script or characters , this short is just that .  this was the typical women prison movie . i thought the women were very sexy and the outfits were great . all the camera did was focus on the women and the women were always in provocative poses for the camera and they were always scantily dressed ( which i loved ) . this is your basic prison / breakout movie of the 70 ' s . all i can say about this film is that it ' s extremely cheesy , but the women are gorgeous and their butts are great !  i agree with the comments regarding the downward spin . the last view shows have been a little better , but surely the writers need some more direction . i think the characters are still interesting , although sometimes they spin into the " white trash " things a little too much . subtlety and nuance goes a long way on shows like " office " . i would think the target audience is somewhat similar being they are both on the same night and lineup . one would think that karma and the whole eastern religion thing is a big enough topic to bring some different and interesting shows , but they only scratch the surface of the subject . in my opinion it shows the contempt that many people have in hollywood about the level of intelligence of the masses . we can handle more heady content . it has been proved before in many other shows .  a group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of suttersville . despite warnings by the local sheriff , murphy ( john phillip law ) , old man prichard ( richard lynch ) a bedraggled hick who swindles tourists with supposed collectible wanted posters , and kooky superstitious aunt nelly ( karen black ) to stay out of the mine due to it ' s notorious legend ( . . that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to devil and murdered a priest ' s ( jeff conaway ) daughter will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft ) , these people only see the green , not the blood red which could potentially ooze from their slain bodies . finding the gold of jeremiah stone intact , they line their pockets and carrying cases , prepared for the bright futures that supposedly lie ahead . but , when you do not heed the warnings of those you consider backwoods loons , the obvious result will be gruesome death . jeremiah stone , as we see , is lying merely a skeleton near an alter containing skulls lined next to each other as the candles on top of them light up , the pickax underneath awaiting it ' s master , with dust particles returning him to a grotesque corpse with demonic exposition , his eyes aglow with wrath . this hapless group , hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold providing them with warm prospects for life ahead , will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean pickax . another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle , directing it ' s path straight into her neck . another failed attempt to retreat has stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree , his body engulfed in flames as he fails to escape without harm . another , a local girl searching for her new friends , worried about their well being , receives the pickax buried into her stomach . aunt nelly informs those still alive about the forty-niner and the curse on those who raids his eternal stash . . and pays the price for relating such information . will anybody survive ? or , is the entire group fated to perish at the hands of the zombie miner ? 

make-up effects artist and monster creator , john carl buechler directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong story-telling , opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his path . he provides just enough back story , and this is feeble at best , for the killer allowing special guest star , karen black ( . . oh how her career has sunken into the abyss ) to explain to the viewer about him . the story given to us has the miner holding a priest ' s daughter hostage , threatening to execute her as the suttersville authorities warn against such an action . startling enough , stone plants that pickax right into her back , with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to satan . retreating to his domain , the mine shaft , stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what ' s his , the loot . typical of most slashers in general , this bunch of twenty-somethings are your garden variety victims , with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them . they are the usual group , from the city , trespassing unto unfamiliar territory , resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant . like many of the later 80 ' s slashers , a good deal of the violence is off-screen . what is on screen , the minimal gore , is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly . the ghoul make-up for the killer is only shown occasionally ; he ' s mostly shrouded in darkness , the victims ' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction . one thing ' s for certain , stunt men were set on fire many times . at least three times , a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle . martin cove has a minor cameo as black ' s former husband , caleb , now living with a much younger , and dense , honey . vernon wells ( . . of the road warrior and commando fame ) has the back story role of jeremiah stone as a human , still capturing the same type of menace he specializes in . john phillip law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff , welcoming the outsiders to his neck of the woods . buechler has quite an attractive cast of actresses , all wearing tight pants and smallish shirts , showing off their sleek and athletic figures , especially elina madison as easy-lay roxann , always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk , hayden ( rick majeske ) . stephen wastell ( the ghosts of edendale ) is axl , a rather clumsy foil , used as a butt of many jokes including his " dump in the woods " scene and current unemployment status .  fred astaire is reteamed with rita hayworth one year after their big hit for columbia , " you ' ll never get rich " . that was the movie which put hayworth on the hollywood map , yet her performance in this wan romantic musical hardly gives a suggestion why she was so suddenly popular . down buenos aires way , a tyrannical hotel owner demands that his four daughters marry in order of age ; one may think film takes place in the 18th century , but no , it ' s modern-day 1942 . astaire is an ex-hoofer-turned-gambler who goes back to dancing to earn some money , getting mixed up in impersonating a letter-writing admirer to hayworth ' s stone-cold society beauty . fred gazes at rita with a brotherly smile , but she ' s so mannequin-like ( lip-synching to her songs like a wide-eyed wind-up doll ) that all romantic sparks quickly sputter . they do dance together quite comfortably , however , and the jerome kern score is unmemorable but not too bad . * * from * * * *  the film opens with a cult leader attempting to resurrect a dead member with his followers chanting for his rebirth as the sun strikes upon them in the desert . reanhauer ( bill roy ) believes wholeheartedly in his power , and gets so worked up that he collapses with what appeared to be a heart attack . unable to keep him alive , all those involved , doctors and nurses , are sentenced for attack with reanhauer ' s demonic spirit invading the curvaceous body of nurse sherri ( . . big-chested jill jacobson ) targeting each one using her as a tool of vengeance . forced against her will , with no memory of inflicting such harm , sherri ' s host body murders selected victims . fortunately , sherri ' s fellow co-worker , nurse tara ( marilyn joi ) begins a rather blossoming romance with a blinded patient , marcus washington ( prentiss moulden ) , once a star football player , whose mother was a practitioner of voodoo . through marcus ' knowledge , passed down from mom , tara finds out about possession and how to possibly save sherri before she murders everyone unknowingly . meanwhile , sherri ' s lover , dr . peter desmond ( geoffrey land ) worries about her present condition and welfare . 

well , this was my first al adamson film and i must agree with his detractors that , just from this film alone , it seems he holds them together with paper clips and elmer ' s glue . the animation with which we see the spirit take control of sherri is beyond awful and rather laughable . a little soft-core nonsense as filler , some demonic possession thrown in the mix ( sherri actually speaks in another voice when she ' s possessed ) , with naughty nurse behavior ( . . the three nurses focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free-spirited ) and a little bit violence / gore . the film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with dull dialogue from a rather mundane cast . the sexual situations aren ' t that hard-core and al often shoots them without revealing all that much . the film looks embarrassingly cheap and there ' s an absence of thrills , although the chilling score ( . . which sounds like something from dark shadows ) does help a little bit . jacobson and mary kay pass ( . . as nurse beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if she ' ll even screw a nutty patient , always complaining of illnesses he really doesn ' t have , with enough chest hair to declare him a neanderthal ) aren ' t bad looking , and adamson ' s story-line , although frail , is somewhat coherent ( . . it seems he rarely directs films which are ) . overall , the movie looks like it cost 5 bucks and adamson just can not overcome the budgetary restrictions ( . . or , in my opinion , create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story ) . john f goff has the role of the hospital ' s psychiatrist who wants to commit sherri , not believing the idea that she was possessed ; he constantly bickers with peter over her . i watched the unrated " lost " version which i guess is the real version to watch of nurse sherri .  when i saw this movie three years ago , i thought it exemplified a lot of the traits found in singapore art-house movies : slow-moving , with a minimal of plot and dialogue , depending on film composition to make it work . 

during then , amongst local cineastes , the inability to appreciate " be with me " is tantamount to panning " citizen kane " or any of ozu ' s late films . i ' ve no idea how " be with me " reached such hallowed heights in singapore ' s cinematic consciousness , but i always felt that khoo ' s " 12 storeys " is a better film , even though the latter film does not boast as good a cinematographer as adrian tan , khoo ' s dp for " be with me " . " 12 storeys " has a story that better relates to most singaporeans and has bite too , something that " be with me " ' s threadbare wistfulness doesn ' t have . 

 " be with me " is basically a barely interlinked trio of narratives strung together into a film by khoo and his screenwriter wong kim hoh . it deals with a security guard who falls in love with a girl whom he only sees in the distance ; two girls in a horoerotic relationship ; and the story of deaf-and-blind teresa chan . 

 " be with me " is very well filmed by tan , using a varicam camera . the film compositions are masterful . the film , almost entirely silent , has next to no dialogue . characters move around , not in a realistic manner , but almost as if they are models under the instruction of a director , almost always looking into the screen and emoting : either loneliness or sadness . unfortunately the characters don ' t act against each other . this kind of film has been seen before many times : in tsai ming-liang ' s films , in khoo ' s protÃ©gÃ© royston tan ' s " 4 : 30 " and elsewhere . sadly , its ultra-slowness ( essentially plot less ) and use of a lento piano soundtrack simply doesn ' t appeal to me . 

to criticize " be with me " seems almost to negate the inspirational story behind it , that of teresa chan , who is blind and deaf and yet lives a fulfilling life despite all this , yet i ' m afraid this film doesn ' t do anything much to me . i ' m willing to applaud chan ' s steadfast and courageous march in life and tan ' s striking cinematography , but for a better take on the same subject-matter with more meat ( without the two other tedious and distracting subplots ) , try werner herzog ' s " land of silence and darkness " ( 1971 ) .  i somehow failed for a few years to see this film , although it has been quite successful and generated a lot of discussions in israel . i am sorry that i did not postpone indefinitely seeing it . 

the theme of ' kadosh ' is a very real and painful one for those who know the jewish religious world - the place of women in the orthodox family and society . the basic situation that sits at the premises of the film is possible , the problem is that the way it is brought to screen and the ' solution ' that the conflicts described receives in the movie is wrong . gitai does not seem to have too much sympathy for men in the religious world , but his approach of picking characters that are either fanatic , or unable to express their human feeling makes the whole story seem simplistic . neither does he a much better service to his women characters , although here at least he shows more sympathy and he also enjoys the participation of two beautiful and gifted actresses in yael abecassis and meital barda . overall gitai ' s vision is too one-sided , his cinema means are too basic , he focuses on the technical details of the jewish religious life , which may be interesting for people who do not know them but are really not relevant at all in the context of the whole story . starting from interesting premises what we get here is a boring film which seems longer than it is , with a very static way of acting , obsessive use of music that plays in the same register not only from a musical but also from an emotional perspective and a very inconclusive if not even confusing ending . what difference between this film and ' ha ushpizin ' inspired from and describing the very same social landscape and which succeeded to transmit human feelings on the screen . in ' kadosh ' there are both too little cinema and too little human emotions .  i had watched this on italian tv as a kid and recall being fond of it â in view of its mixing live-action with animation ; however , it was universally panned at the timeâ¦and , catching up with it again after all these years , i have to admit that the critics were right ! 

what must have seemed wondrous to a child ' s eyes is actually very poorly done , not to mention boring for a fantasy-adventure ; fatally , both star ( ex- ' angry young man ' richard harris ) and director ( action expert hunt ) are ill-suited to the material ! at least , michel legrand ' s score ( with lyrics provided by scriptwriter don black ) is serviceable â if not exactly inspired . by the way , a number of well-known personalities are featured among the voice artists on this british-belgian co-production ( julian glover , bessie love , murray melvin , robert rietty , vladek sheybal , graham stark and , this being his last film work , michael bates ) . 

while the essential plot points of jonathan swift ' s classic novel ( ' giant ' gulliver becomes the pawn in a war between the little people of two neighboring countries and , on escaping , ends up in a land of real giants ) do emerge here , it ' s done on a strictly kiddie level ( with stereotyped characters though , thankfully , little intrusion of the comic / romantic variety ) â which renders the whole venture somewhat pointless , outside of its intrinsically experimental nature , since max and dave fleischer had already done a splendid feature-length cartoon version of the book way back in 1939 !  the kissing bandit was the third and final film that frank sinatra and kathryn grayson co-starred at mgm with . the first two were anchors aweigh and it happened in brooklyn . and in both sinatra wooed and lost grayson . i guess the third time ' s the charm . 

for romance maybe , but definitely not for screen image . sinatra in his forty ' s films once again plays the nice little schnook only this time in toreador pants . poaching on tyrone power ' s territory laid out in the mark of zorro , sinatra plays the son of a man who was a hotel owner by day and the kissing bandit by night . he ' s gone and left california for an education and has come back ready to take dad ' s place , but in the hotel business only . and where does he learn the hotel business , boston . 

of course some of dad ' s former gang members , grown a little old and paunchy led by j . carrol naish , want him to lead the gang again . but frank ' s just not cut out for the outlaw life . but he does make a good impression on the governor ' s daughter , kathryn grayson . 

somebody must have had it in for sinatra at mgm to cast him in this after the bad reviews he got in miracle of the bells . frank ' s in a part that was more suitable for red skelton . but since this was a musical , i guess the brain trust at mgm figured kathryn grayson had to have a singing co-star . 

in fact the best number in the film are for her , love is where you find it . also ricardo montalban , ann miller , and cyd charisse do a dance specialty that is nice . frank ' s songs are nice , but nothing spectacular . 

in later years , sinatra would wince at the mention of the kissing bandit and with good reason .  low budget , but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar frankenstein story . this movie is also known as lady frankenstein . the alluring tania frankenstein ( sara bay ) fresh from medical school arrives at her father ' s estate to find that he is still up to his old tricks . baron frankenstein ( joseph cotten ) is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to carry on the family tradition by creating herself a lover . this is closer to being an eerie melodrama than horror flick . supporting cast features mickey hargitay , paul whiteman , paul muller and herbert fux . a rainy night could amplify the atmosphere . still a fun watch .  a wallflower is tossed into the sea and dreams herself into a pirate fantasy as a damsel in love with a pirate ' s apprentice . energetic and good-natured , perhaps , but a shoddy enterprise ; a failed musical send-up of " the pirates of penzance " with a cheap , backlot feel , wan bubblegum songs and constant , leering overacting . kristy mcnichol ' s film career took a real hit after this , while leading man christopher atkins cannot get a grip of any particular emotion , his voice wobbling about in search of an appropriate tone . you have to wonder , if that ' s the best title they could come up with , what ' s the level of wit going to be in the actual script ? the movie ' s " grease " -like affection for musicals doesn ' t gel with its penchant for slapstick a la " airplane ! " , although mcnichol works overtime being effervescent and nearly makes the limp handling look endearing . for the most part , it is an embarrassment . * 1 / 2 from * * * *  i have always liked the carry on films , with their double-meaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy , but i can see why the critics give this one two stars . basically , many british people are gathering on a coach to go on a spanish holiday to an island called elsbels to the palace hotel . what they didn ' t know is that it is not completely built , plus they have to share bathrooms with their neighbours , they have crap draws , and many other complications and complaints that the owner pepe ( peter butterworth , putting on quite an amusing accent , e . g . peace sounding like the bad p word ) . starring sid james as vic flange , kenneth williams as stuart farquhar , charles hawtrey as eustace tuttle , joan sims as cora flange , barbara windsor as sadie tomkins , kenneth connor as stanley blunt , an apparently crap ( i personally can ' t remember who he is ) jimmy logan as bert conway , june whitfield as evelyn blunt , hattie jacques as floella ( a ridiculous hag character , not as memorable as her usual matron ) , bernard bresslaw as brother bernard , sally geeson as lily , carol hawkins as marge , jack douglas as harry and patsy rowlands as miss dobbs . i admit it is not great , but there are just enough dialogue gags , and of course babs in the shower , and going to to her bum with that iconic whistle , and later a rapid rip off of her bra . okay !  i saw winnie ' s heffalump a couple of days ago . a nice story based on well known characters created by a . a . milne . although winnie , piglet , tigger and rabbit are all present in this animated feature , the main character is roo this time . he befriends with scary heffalump who proves to be not scary at all and shows everybody that friendship knows no boundaries and everybody wants and deserves to be happy . i love this film and i would love it even more were i 10 or 15 years younger . alas , i would like to become a kid again to enjoy this heffalump story much more but all i am left with is a sense of sadness at the loss of a sort of childishness and innocence of which this movie is full i was glad to hear carly simon sing , joel mcneely provided great score .  has this ever happened to you ? i go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals in the " film noir " section . i spy a copy of a new arrival of a film i have never seen called naked alibi . its from one of those mail order video companies that offers ( mostly ) " dupey " looking copies of hard to find titles . the description on the box sounds good . the film has players i like ( sterling hayden , gloria grahame , and gene barry ) . so i take it home and watch it . about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts . about half way through this film i started to dislike it . by the time the film ended , i not only disliked it , i despised it . the film opens with cops questioning al willis on suspicion of robbery . other than being drunk , the police have nothing on him . when he pushes a cop and demands to be allowed to go home , the cops beat him up . detective conroy arrives , lets the cops finish the beating and then announces willis is in the clear . willis swears he will get revenge . later one of the police officers is shot dead . with no evidence other that willis is " sore " about the beating , conroy make willis his sole suspect , despite the fact that his boss names a pair of mobsters as suspects . conroy arrests him , but for lack evidence willis is released . the next day two more cops are killed by a bomb . this time conroy goes to the bakery that willis owns and tries to beat a confession out of him . conroy doesn ' t know it but a local newsman whose paper has been accusing conroys department of police brutality snaps a picture of conroy trying strangle willis and conroy is fired . but conroy continues his pursuit and willis flees to mexico where willis has a mistress . conroy manages to convince his mistress ( who willis treats rather rough ) to help him prove willis is a killer . what this film lacks is a convincing script . the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed . things happen , characters personalities change , plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it . other than the fact that willis likes to tip a glass now and than , there is nothing in the early part of the film to make us think that he is a crazy killer that cheats on his wife . he treats his wife , his kid and employees well . early in the film , one gets the impression that its conroy is the one whose is a loose cannon . he seems to casually approve of police brutality . conroy , for no reason is convinced from the very start willis has criminal past . he seems to operate on the motto of the old communist bulgarian secret police ; " everyone is guilty of something , we just have not found out about it yet . " later conroy shows kindness to al ' s mistress and young son , now we are supposed to like him . sorry ! the early impression i got of conroy stuck with me too long . and he is also a dumb cop . only after he is fired and goes to mexico does he run a background check on willis and discovers that a warrant is out for him issued in maryland . why didn ' t he think of this before ? because this film hadn ' t used up enough running time . the cast is good . gene barry does well considering how poorly conceived his role of al willis is . i ' m big fan of 40 ' s and 50 ' s crime thrillers but not only did i not think this film was good , it left a bad taste in my mouth ( something many modern films do , but older films rarely do ) .  if you ever visited shenandoah acres as a child and wondered , could there be a worse vacation spot in the world ? well , you could have watched this movie and had your answer . flavia ( a . k . a . fistula ) macintyre ' s dude ranch is often frequented by business casual gordon , at least since resident water witch , jessica , was 13 . but jessica can find much more than fresh spring water with that divining rod Â buried " tray-shure , " lost jewelry , dead bodies , even a talisman that will keep her from dressing like a slut and raising drinks with a phony beat and a suzanne pleshette look-alike while hypnotized by a disembodied head . evil , evil evil .  i agree with one commentator who says that it ' s really impossible to review glen or glenda ? objectively . if one does so , the film on its merits would have to be rated as fairly terrible given the hilarious , convoluted dialog , the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values . yet , such an assessment does not capture the absolutely riveting experience of watching this film as it unfolds . it isn ' t the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the 1950s . it ' s not even the plea for tolerance of people who embrace alternate life choices that fascinates except as an historic relic . 

no , what makes glen or glenda ? still a fascinating film after 50 years is that ed wood laid his psyche bare in a way that so-called auteur directors like hitchcock or godard , despite their vastly superior talents , never did . in glen or glenda , wood isn ' t afraid to reveal his own deeply conflicted feelings about being a transvestite despite the plea for tolerance for it through out the film . indeed , the conclusion of the film suggest that ed wood ' s glen character will be able to " kill " his glenda female counterpart by transferring the feelings of love and affection glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife , barbara . the psychiatrist even reassures glen and barbara that as glen makes that psychic transference , glenda will disappear . so , while wood could plead for tolerance of transvestites in general , he wasn ' t so sure of desiring it for himself . 

moreover , wood wasn ' t afraid of throwing everything else that crossed his mind on the screen . he did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on . if it didn ' t cohere , so what ? what the viewer saw in glen or glenda especially was ed wood ' s imaginative world in all of its fundamental strangeness . 

the only comment i wish to add to my comment above is that my two-star rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in the first paragraph . the oddly memeric effect the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities i don ' t think can be rated .  when naÃ¯ve young eddie hatch , a window dresser at savory ' s department store , falls for a statue of venus and gives her a chaste kiss , venus steps off her pedestal and gives eddie more than he bargained for . this creaking example of what hollywood can do to a broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the first-rate songs . the purpose was to make a safe , popular movie without too much investment while capitalizing on ava gardner ' s upward mobility to super stardom . robert walker as eddie gets lost in a thankless role . eddie ' s not just naive , but dithering and hapless . gardner is gorgeous , but the only things that give the movie any life are olga san juan as eddie ' s loving but jealous girl friend , tom conway as the suave owner of savory ' s and eve arden as savory ' s long time , wise cracking secretary . it ' s a role arden could play in her sleep , and she ' s good at it . 

the musical opened on broadway in 1943 and made mary martin a big-time star . the only point of a musical , however , is to have music . since one touch of venus was intended to be a social satire of sorts , kurt weill , composing , and ogden nash writing the lyrics , came up with a series of stylish , witty songs and one masterpiece . without the satire , or the clever songs or martin ( or an equivalent showstopper ) , the movie becomes just a weak comedy fantasy where much of the comedy is predictable and the fantasy is worked to death . 

not only did the producers of the movie toss out almost all the weill / nash songs , they brought in the movie ' s music director , ann ronell , to write new lyrics for one of the songs that survived , turning sharp observation into lovey-dovey romance . ronell was no hack ; she wrote willow weep for me . wonder what she thought about while she replaced or tweaked ogden nash ' s clever work . 

the one bright spot in the movie is that weill / nash masterpiece . " speak low " is as great a love song as anyone ever wrote . it ' s given one of those ultra-professional and lifeless treatments by eileen wilson dubbing gardner . dick haymes contributes a chorus . 

as for ann ronell , she was one of the few women in hollywood to become a major music director , as well as composer and lyric writer . yours for a song : the women of tin pan alley is a fascinating documentary of some of the women who made it in the business , including ronell , kay swift , dorothy fields and dana suess . and for those who would like to hear what little of the weill / nash score was recorded by the original broadway cast , you might be able to track down the cd , one touch of venus ( 1943 original cast ) / lute song ( 1946 original cast ) . the music is paired with lute song , another broadway show that starred martin .   ' rise of the footsoldier ' follows the unrelentingly cruel journey of gangster carlton leach and his associates through drugs , violence , sex , violence , guns , violence and did i mention violence ? 

protagonist carlton leach ( ricci harnett ) , member of the i . c . f ( inner city firm ) ; a group of football hooligans turned professional gangsters , guides the audience through the events leading to the 1995 ' range rover killings ' , in which three gang members fell victim to particularly vicious professional ' hits ' . leach ' s success as a doorman and talent for locating aptly violent friends to control unruly punters at a local nightclub launches him into the company of notorious drug dealers and gangsters , profitably benefiting from the 80s / 90s rave scene and drug culture . 

opening with brutally realistic shots of the dead men , the viewer is left thirsty to understand what happened , but left wholly unsatisfied . the next 2 hours meander through a series of countless character introductions . each of these basically establishes yet another typical ' hard man ' , shows him assaulting usually undeserving victims , before probably coming to an even nastier end . what little emotional understanding the audience is allowed to form for a few of the characters ( for example a family man blamed for missing drugs ) is quickly destroyed when they are either anti-climactically killed , or their storyline left unresolved . the hints of a plot introduced in the beginning are inadequately concluded with vague impressions of how the murders occurred , as the events are slotted into place with little reward for persevering with the hazy muddle of previous events . 

this film has been made with a standard formula in mind , for an audience who prefer violence and ' ard nut ' slang to an actual storyline . ' rise of the footsoldier ' borrows too much from ' football factory ' , leaving out the good bits , demonstrating no moral ramifications of hooligan subculture or establishing empathy with the protagonist . the violence , although brilliantly shot , seems excessive and implausible because no one is around long enough for the audience to form an emotional attachment . the implication that the gangs are untouchable by the police is fair enough , but machete-wielding doormen regularly committing blatant murder in public places pushes the imagination of even the most willing viewer . the audience are left bewildered as to the relevance of many key events and developed characters that had no knock on effect on the eventual conclusion . attempted ' gritty-realism ' is further destroyed with a substance called ' truth serum ' , which the turkish mafia use to coax honest answers from unwilling individuals . this is not the genre in which to invent psychologically unrealistic drugs , and renders the interrogation almost absurd . 

the actual scenes of violence ( before becoming repetitive ) hold some tension , spliced with rapid flashes of colour or the end of a film reel . seamlessly choreographed brawls coupled with obligatory but effective shaky hand-held camera work saves the film , but unfortunately the plot ( or lack there of ) limits it to a niche demographic . 

in essence , the events this film is based on aren ' t deservedly represented , and an adequately sequential storyline is sacrificed for stereotypical characters and an unoriginal plot . this film has a place in the market , but if you like a bit of brain with your brutality this one isn ' t for you . 

http : / / www . obsessedwithfilm . com /  hitchcock ' s original classic benefited tremendously not only from the performance of , but also the ' look ' of anthony perkins . he projected a kind of clean-cut innocence : a young teen-idol type of persona . he was not an actor who had portrayed baddies before this ; nor was he physically suited to the role of what the public might have imagined a psychopath to look like , especially in the 50 ' s when this ultra-chilling aspect of mental illness ( split personality psychosis ) was relatively unexplored in film . which is exactly why the casting of him as norman bates was a slice of true hitchcockian genius . audiences were taken by surprise to put it mildly . 

that ' s why this re-make does not work , even a little bit , in spite of trying to be an exact copy . whereas anthony perkins looked like someone you would never think of as being a serial killer , vince vaughn is easily imaginable as one . he lacks the frail look of perkins and his acting chops are clearly inferior as well , at least in this role ( honestly - has there ever been an actor who could convey nervousness as genuinely as anthony perkins ? ) . while it was a pointless re-make to begin with , the miscasting of the story ' s most important character sucks this film down completely . 

as a side note , i feel that hollywood ' s propensity for re-making great movies because ' young ' people refuse to watch anything that ' s not filmed in color not only stinks to high heaven of corporate greed but is exceptionally disrespectful to the original work . as for viewers who can ' t watch black and white - it ' s their loss . hopefully they ' ll mature sometime in the future and no longer require shiny colours to hold their attention . when they do they ' ll discover that sometimes black and white works far better . with the background muted , the story and performances are that much more front and center . and in many cases the mood or atmosphere created through black and white cinematography is just not attainable in colour .  perhaps , we are too much attached to great spectacles when we hear of antiquity brought to screen . perhaps , we expect too much from these films . however , if we , as viewers , are offered far too little , what happens then ? 

that is what i thought after seeing imperium - nerone by paul marcus , a part of the production series on the roman empire . augustus by roger young , the first imperium movie , included at least peter o ' toole but what does this movie include ? 

hardly anything accurate . the historical errors are so serious that the movie changes facts and constitutes rather a distorted image of the roman empire than the true history . throughout the movie , we see nero young : young man during the allegedly long reign of caligula , young man during the reign of claudius and finally during his own ( historically 14 year long ) reign . and . . . he dies the same . according to the movie , nero , born during the reign of tiberius , lives for more than 40 years but looks to be in his late twenties when he dies . . . continuity combined with made up history is the biggest problem of the movie , which makes it hardly logical , not to say reliable . nero loses his father , is raised by slaves . at that time , his mother , agrippina , is exiled by caligula . later , however , she suddenly marries emperor claudius who already has big children with freshly married to him messalina . at these moments of the movie , we see acte ( rike schmid ) , nero ' s mistress . all right , it is historically " accurate " ; yet , no source proves that she played such a decisive role in the rise of christianity in rome . in the film , she is not only a devoted christian but even a witness of st paul ' s miracle ( he brings a young girl marzia back to life ) . besides , there was , historically , nothing like nero seen on the court of caligula since nero was born in caligula ' s 4 year long reign ( a . d . 37-41 ) . i understand that movies may change something but such an error makes the script absolutely unreliable ! and many , many other shortcomings concerning content that are hard to enumerate but after 30 minutes of watching this film , i doubted whether i was watching a historical movie or a total fantasy . 

as for its artistic features which supply us with entertainment , they are equally lame as the history here is . the performances are artificial , the cast simply have beautiful faces but weak acting abilities . perhaps , i am too much attached to peter ustinov or charles laughton in the lead , but hans matheson does not fit as nero at all . he could have some of the good moments as an actor but never as the infamous roman emperor . is he an artist who burns rome for a song ? is he a cynic who disguises the love to his relatives ? is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for the sake of " alleged justice " ? none of these . he is just a young man who does not know how to rule and , in the long run , begins to release the fire burning within himself . . . john simm is out of place in this film as caligula and absolutely inferior to other portrayals of the character . elisa tovati is only sexy as poppaea ; yet she could have been much much better . the costumes are inaccurate and the sets do not amaze . low budget results in low effects and , consequently , low entertainment . 

but what made me most angry in this movie and , as a result , i give it 1 / 10 are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable : 

- the death of poppaea and st paul ' s talk with nero at her dead body , 

- claudius ' mention of the current conquest of britannia on the feast and soon his death ( he conquered britannia while messalina was his wife much before his death ) , 

- tigellinus killing agrippina ( laura morante ) , nero ' s mother , 

- nero ' s arguments in the speech to the senators , 

- finally , nero ' s death - a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral said by acte " let us forgive him " 

all in all , this film is a waste of time and is absolutely unneeded as yet another production concerning the roman empire . it ' s better to make one good film in 30 years than ten minor little ones in 5 years . 1 / 10 - should not have been made at all .  despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century , erwin rommel is generally well-regarded by historians and world war ii buffs as a gentleman , a soldier ' s soldier , and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare . if only hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in africa , the argument goes , things would have gone very differently . and that ' s probably true . rommel was , in fact , a military genius , and by all accounts an upstanding , honest man . 

but this film goes out of its way to portray him as a near-saint . he does his job , trying to win the war for hitler , but constantly the fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous orders , which rommel ( james mason ) expresses amazement with but rarely actually questions and never , ever disobeys . only when it ' s patently obvious that hitler is leading germany to ruin does rommel think of treason against him ; this dilemma plays out as the main theme of the film , a good man in bad circumstances trying to do the right thing . 

mason is fine as rommel , but it ' s hardly a memorable performance along the lines of , say , george c . scott as patton . of course , rommel wasn ' t as colorful as patton , but this film is so intent on making him look like a decent human being that it forgets to make him interesting . he occasionally lapses into some warmth when with his wife lucie ( a young jessica tandy , well-cast ) , but usually mason is called upon to give a stiff british performance Â as if the brits were trying to claim rommel for themselves ( though in all fairness all the nazis have english accents except hitler ) . 

done on the cheap , with any battle scenes swiping stock footage , and the beaches of southern california doubling for tunisia , there ' s nothing to particularly recommend this film . a remake could be interesting ( i ' d pick ed harris only because of a slight physical resemblance and , well , harris can act ) were it spiced up a little , but this movie mostly demonstrated to me how much more demanding we as viewers have become in the last fifty years ; a biography this bland would never cut it any more .  donald sutherland , an american paleontologist visiting england , picks up a hitch hiker one evening . two years later , having discovered the man ' s address book in his car , he returns the book to the man ' s opulent home , only to find that the man ' s been hanged for murder . nobody in or out of the family seems to care that the hitch hiker could not have committed the murder ( of his own stepmother ) because he was in sutherland ' s car at the time of the crime . 

sutherland is the man ' s alibi but he ' s turned up too late . out of a sense of guilt , he tracks down the real murderer . 

agatha christie ' s mysteries usually involve a number of diverse people , all of them with one or another motive for the crime , all of them suspect , and a puzzle that depends on the construction of a strict time line . there is often , not always , a sidekick with whom the investigator can talk things over . 

because of the anfractuosity of the situation , due care must be taken to explain each element of the mystery to the reader or viewer . redundancy is perfectly okay . we have to keep the characters and the time lines straight . christie ' s movies are of the rare kind in which the use of famous faces in subordinate characters is actually useful . ( jacqueline de bellefort ? oh , yes , that ' s mia farrow . ) but this version of " ordeal by innocence " is a golan-globus production , with all that implies in the way of production values , a thoughtfully prepared script , and skill behind the camera . 

the first few minutes , in which sutherland discovers that an innocent man has been hanged , are fine . after that , everything is flung at the viewer in disjointed scraps , often in sudden flashbacks or in confusing voiceovers that tell us nothing . the script has a slapdash quality , as if thrown together by two hacks overnight . few of the faces are familiar and that doesn ' t help at all . everyone drops remarks about everyone else and the names become a hopeless jumble . the musical score consists of four instruments doing irritating atonal jazz riffs . some nudity is thrown in to wake up the dozers in the audience . if dame agatha were alive , she ' d be among the viewers who needed to be shaken awake . 

dullsville .  this show is not in my opinion , good , then again i have not enjoyed any cartoon from disney channel . except for " the proud family " because that so is about a normal female teen this show is very similar to the way i feel about lilo and stich the series . it was a mistake turning the movie into a cartoon because the movie was excellent , the cartoon is terrible . disney channel was doing just fine before adding all these stupid cartoons such as dave the barbarian , brandy and mr . whiskers , lilo and stich the series , american dragon jake long , and where it all started : kim possible . the shows would have been better had they come to playhouse disney ! as for this particular show kuzko will never get out of school just as dave the barbarian ' s parents will never return home , and as brandy and mr . whiskers will never get out of the jungle .  it ' s partly bad luck for " illuminata " that it comes out after " shakespeare in love " as it deals with virtually the same themes of life as art , art as life and the magic of the theatre and the same archetypal foibles of theater folk , but a whole lot more ponderously . 

there are scenes that come alive , as a play develops and gets reinterpreted by a writer ' s life , but there ' s a whole lot of orson welles-ish ego in this produced by / directed by / lead acted by john torturro as a vehicle for his wife katharine borowitz ( with an adorable cameo by their son ) . 

each actor gets his / her moment literally in the spotlight , but there ' s so many " masques " or set pieces that seem like 19th century parlor games . bill irwin talks . susan sarandon gets to be a diva . christopher walken gets to be a different kind of villain - a gay critic . the women have to disrobe unnecessarily because this is an art film . 

the art and set direction are marvelous , though quite dark . this should get an award as the best use of a jersey city theater as a set ever in a movie . ( originally written 8 / 21 / 99 )  this movie was pure genius . john waters is brilliant . it is hilarious and i am not sick of it even after seeing it about 20 times since i bought it a few months ago . the acting is great , although ricki lake could have been better . and johnny depp is magnificent . he is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor . and seeing most of johnny ' s movies , this is probably my favorite . i give it 9 . 5 / 10 . rent it today !  esther williams plays a romantically unattached water-skiing secretary who longs to stop " walking on the water " and be some man ' s wife ; van johnson and tony martin are her potential choices for a husband . despite fine aquatic sequences filmed at florida ' s cypress gardens , this romantic comedy is awfully stale . as helmed by plodding director charles walters , everything here is made to seem intentionally innocuous , which doesn ' t lend the picture much staying power . even esther ' s big moments in the water are not quite up to the mesmerizing leaps from her other swimming vehicles , though they are preferable to the asides with the men , both of whom are colorless . carroll baker , in her film debut as martin ' s disgruntled ex-girlfriend , is the liveliest of the bunch . flimsy stuff , indeed . * 1 / 2 from * * * *   " black friday " did this plot so much better , which is why it is remembered and " the man with two lives " is just a forgotten potboiler . " shed no tears " was it ' s working title and it would have been a better one as he was a thoroughly evil character for most of the film . 

philip bennett is newly engaged when he is involved in a traffic accident . dr . clark ( edward keene ) has been involved in some experimental operations on animals - bringing them back from the dead . his colleagues urge him to try his operation on phillip , who has died . as he is operating , a dangerous criminal , wolf panino , is going to the electric chair and trans migration of the soul occurs . when phillip awakes from the operation , he has the soul of panino . he is a changed person , he is rude to his family and starts to hang around panino ' s old haunts . he takes over wolf ' s old gang - going by the name of philip bennett , he also romance ' s wolf ' s former girlfriend - who smells a rat . bennett , as wolf , is determined to even up scores and starts to eliminate his enemies . bodies pile up , including the girlfriend and a policeman , then his own family begins to fall victim . 

but - i hate those " bad dream " movies - you always feel let down . this film would have been better if he had stayed in character as panino and had a final shoot out . eleanor , his fiancÃ©e , would have ended up sadder but wiser with his brother . 

edward norris , the star , had a big career mostly in b movies . 

not really recommended .  dictated by thin experience ( of both life and industry ) and no cash sofia coppola ' s early short is almost by necessity an observational piece set on a high school campus . the cast are rather weak and do not benefit from being shot in b & w ( it ' s difficult to tell the characters apart ) . the sound editing does little to help a simple story of fickle teenage allegiance . 

yet there are one or two things to note . inamongst the inconsistent editing the high school campus is filmed with a balance of aspirant wide and intimate close-up shots . the editing-to-music also creates an interest and momentum ( without descent into the netherworld of the music video ) . coppola clearly made an attempt to vary the pace of the film . the dramatic turn is cut fast and to-the-point and the second act is almost non-existent ; we recognise it ' s actually been played out in tandem with the first , which is the point of the narrator-on-crutches trope ( who is an otherwise curiously appended character in that first act ) . 

despite these notes it ' s an awkward short . 2 / 10 this is the first recorded effort to put sound with a movie , and a the oldest that , obviously , is still in existence . this historic piece of film is the opening segment in the " more treasures of the natural archives " dvd . 

it ' s only a 15-second clip of a man playing a violin in front of a huge recording cylinder . next to him are two men dancing . near the end , another man walks on the stage . william dickson , the director of this experiment , is the violin player . this " movie " had several titles over the years but the sound experiment was not really a success . it took over 30 years from this point to the synchronize sight and sound to the point where something could be issued to the public for entertainment . however , this was a start , no matter how primitive it came off . 

for more of the technical information and history of this film process , see the other review here by " boba fett1138 . "  lonely , disconnected , middle-class housewife in the midst of a divorce seeks solace to reflect on her immediate future . at some sort of bed and breakfast by ( well , literally in the sea ) the ocean that for some sort of odd reason she subs for the owner . enter lonely , arrogant richard gere . he is a plastic surgeon . he is the only guest at the inn in the sea . diane lane is the lonely housewife . you ' ll never guess these two fall immediately in love . a tropical storm makes them true lovers . 

the subplots in this melodrama make little or no sense . the locations , photography are fine . gere remains one of the most over-rated actors in cinema and does not disappoint . ms . lane must ' ve needed the money , but phones in her part with grace .  jeff fahey has such alert eyes and a smudgy , insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous ; therefore , it doesn ' t really work to cast him as the good guy of the piece , the audience is just waiting for his character to crack and start blowing people away . drew barrymore , fresh off her acclaimed role as " poison ivy " , must have done this film simply as a favor to director phedon papamichael ( he was the cinematographer on " ivy " ) ; playing a character named daisy drew ( ! ) , she ' s bumped off right away , which leaves us with no one to look at but jeff fahey and sean young ( who hasn ' t had a single subtle moment on camera since " blade runner " ) . this witless script , by michael angeli , concerns a police sketch artist who draws his own wife ' s face from a murder witness ' s testimony , and while that ' s not a bad idea for a plot , it would be much better suited to an hour-long tv series . this cable-made movie is short on inspiration ( beginning with the casting ) and shorter on surprises . * from * * * *  surrender cinema has been known for their extremely erotic , almost explicit sci-fi films . while they generally do very well at these ( femalien 1 & 2 , virtual encounters ) , this particular entry seems to be just a rehash of old tape . any number of girls -- some recognizable and others not -- are in this film in all stages of nudity . there are also several clips from other films which are outstanding , unless you ' ve seen those other films . there are a number of solo nude scenes doing a number of things -- some playing basketball , others talking , still others playing with themselves . the only thing of value in this tape is the very last scene -- a short but erotic girl-girl scene with a very enthusiastic and enjoyable sandy wasko and a more subdued tammie hainum . not highly recommended .  committed doom and gloomer peter watkins goes slummin ' across the pond to take on the american justice system circa 1971 with this priceless piece of zeitgeist paranoia that leans so far left it falls over constantly . watkins is pure tourist as he assembles this our gang tragedy with clichÃ© freaks , hippies and black revolutionaries pitted against trigger happy cops and military and a kangaroo court tribunal made up of disapproving calcified adults making poor fashion statements . talk about a revolution . 

in punishment park we have radical youth versus corrupt system as dissenters convicted of crimes are given the choice of imprisonment or a three day trek across punishment park ( death valley ) and freedom . of course the law enforcement officials monitoring their journey aren ' t about to play fair and combined with the stifling heat the fate of our protagonists looks sealed . 

punishment park has elements of kafka in setting as well as theme . trials are held under a large canvas tent where shackled prisoners shout defiance at a hardcore love it or leave it group of inquisitors ( such as members of silent majority for a peaceful america ) who snarl back . neither group spends much time listening to the other and the proceedings sometime takes on a teen parent battle over the keys to the car look . mostly its just one side saying what ' s wrong with america the other saying what ' s right with no one offering solutions for change . meanwhile the punishment park martyrs stumble endlessly about the dessert while cops with guns act like twelve year olds . it kind of has the look and feel of some of my 70 ' s college film making class when we were younger and knew more then than we do now . 

peter watkins has always been on the side of the underdog and the common man against what he perceives as a corrupt powerful few . culledon was a strong indictment of military atrocity in 18th century scotland that still resonates . war game is a raw sobering look at nuclear aftermath that should be required viewing for all . punishment park has its value as well but for other than intended reason . watkins vision today is a textbook example of the left in full tilt counter culture 70s paranoia and given the times ( vietnam , kent state , the chicago 7 ) such strident hysteria seemed not that great a distance from the truth . but 35 years later the fever has subsided and punishment park with it ' s unrestrained narrow viewpoint is a pretty silly ride .  i once saw a bit of this film , and was interested to see the full thing just to see why the critics give it two stars , the result being that i agree . basically the film begins with kermit the frog ( steve whitmire ) telling all his muppet chums that they have lost everything , and he ends sitting depressed ( and possibly thinking about suicide ) on the bench . meanwhile , in another world ( heaven ) angel daniel ( david arquette , who had already been in muppets from space ) visits the ' boss ' ( whoopi goldberg , another reason i wanted to see the film ) to show that kermit really needs help . in the flashbacks , it shows kermit , miss piggy ( eric jacobson , not the original and better frank oz ) , gonzo ( dave goelz ) , fozzie bear ( also jacobson ) , pepe the prawn ( bill barretta ) and all the other muppets have prepared a stage show for many people to see in the christmas holiday , and it all seems to be going well . but the really mean rachel bitterman ( joan cusack ) is determined to either shut the show or the theatre down , and kermit is doing everything possible to make sure that doesn ' t happen . of course , kermit fails the last time , and bitterman tells him that they are finished , and she can officially take the theatre . this is where daniel is sent as kermit ' s guardian angel to try and help him , but kermit is not in the mood , and eventually ends up saying " i wish i was never born " . obviously , you can recognise the spoof of it ' s a wonderful life , with kermit as the george bailey , and cusack as the mr . potter , and in the end , obviously kermit realises how much he means to everyone , and goes back to find the theatre saved as historical landmark . also starring whitmire as rizzo the rat and beaker ; goelz as dr . bunsen honeydew and waldorf ; barretta as dr . teeth , rowlf the dog and swedish chef ; jacobson as animal and yoda ( the only character who sounds similar to oz ' s version ) , william h . macy as glenn , matthew lillard as luc fromage , carson daly , molly shannon ; scrubs ' zach braff , sarah chalke , neil flynn , john c . mcginley and judy reyes , mel brooks as joe snow ; brian henson as scooter and janice ; jerry nelson as robin the frog , statler , pops and floyd pepper , and kevin clash as sam the eagle . the most memorable moment for me is the stage spoof of moulin rouge , besides that and the well known faces in it , not fantastic . it was nominated the emmy for outstanding music and lyrics for the song " everyone matters " . the muppets were number 47 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons . adequate !  critics are falling over themselves within the weinstein ' s sphere of influence to praise this ugly , misguided and repellent adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it ' s based . minghella ' s ham-fisted direction of the egregiously gory and shrill overly-episodic odyssey is one of the many missteps of this " civil-war love story " . are they kidding ? after ms . kidman and mr . law meet cute with zero screen chemistry in a small north carolina town and steal a kiss before its off to war for jude and his photo souvenir of the girl he left behind , it ' s a two hour test to the kidneys as to whether he will survive a myriad of near-death experiences to reunite with his soulmate . who cares ? philip s . hoffman ' s amateurish scene chewing in a disgusting and unfunny role pales to renee zelweger ' s appearance as a corn-fed dynamo who bursts miraculously upon the scene of kidman ' s lonely farm to save the day . rarely has a performance screamed of " look at me , i ' m acting " smugness . her sheer deafening nerve wakes up the longuers for a couple of minutes until the bluster wears painfully thin . released by miramax strategically for oscar and golden globe ( what a farce ) consideration , the weinsteins apparently own , along with dick clark , the critical community and won 8 globe nominations for their overblown failure . the resultant crime is that awards have become meaningless and small , less powerful pr-driven films become obscure . cold mountain is a concept film and an empty , bitter waste of time . cold indeed ! ! !  directed and written by the famous / infamous edward d . wood jr , using a pseudonym ( daniel davis ) playing the lead role of glen / glenda . this is an almost radical documentary about transvestism ; wood himself being a transvestite with a fetish for angora sweaters . it seems miles of stock footage and an incoherent bela lugosi is used to stretch this odd and awkward film to 67 minutes . police inspector ( lyle talbot ) seeks enlightenment from a psychiatrist , dr . alton ( timothy farrell ) , to better understand the emotional and disposition of transvestites . 

also in the cast : delores fuller , " tommy " hanes , captain dezita and wood ' s sister evelyn . of note : farrell also acts as narrator . and fuller later helped write songs included in the elvis presley movies blue hawaii , kissin ' cousins & kid galahad .  this film reeks of production line planning . it appears like the filmmakers looked at recent hit movies , and threw spaghetti on the screen - jimmy stewart ! june allyson ! anthony mann ! baseball ! war ! baby ! airplane ! - roll ' em ! - the film does address the age of the stewart / allyson performers ; though , i ' m certain we are still supposed to think they are much younger . 

there are messages in " strategic air command " i found curiously shocking and offensive , but i ' ll stick with one truly wretched element : the happily married couple is challenged when mr . stewart ' s character makes an important decision without consulting his wife . in the film ' s most dramatic scene , she calls him on it . it ends completely unresolved - allyson is crying her heart out on their bed , and stewart walks out on her . no discussion ; he simply says he is correct , and walks out on his devastated wife . for all he knows , she could slit her wrists . 

later , allyson apologizes for questioning her husband ' s decision . 

unbelievable ! 

stick with stewart-allyson in " the stratton story " ( 1949 ) . 

 * * strategic air command ( 3 / 25 / 55 ) anthony mann ~ james stewart , june allyson , frank lovejoy apparently shrunken heads was the last movie that julius harris had a role in . i have not seen all of his movies , but julius harris was in many good movies , and i remember him best from " live and let die " where he played tee-hee and which was full of voodoo references , something that is common here in south florida ! i always thought live and let die was a great movie because it had some atmosphere and mystique , unlike most of the 007 movies . in shrunken heads , julius harris is back in his voodoo persona ! he has a great style for mystery and the occult , and his part in this movie is excellent . sadly , the rest of the movie is something of a comedy . spoilers : three kids who look like they were fired from the cast of the little rascals get killed by a neighborhood hoodlum who looks like he got fired from the cast of fame ! or as a dancer on dick clark ' s american bandstand . in other words , these kids give low budget another dimension . julius harris goes to the mortuary-funeral home , cuts off the three kids ' heads ( and nobody notices ) and then takes them to his condominium unit where he has a giant cauldron of boiling liquids . the three heads get tossed in , along with some herbs , spices , and voodoo items . at some point mr . harris has the ugly little heads on a table and he spills his blood on them , and they come to life as talking heads ! they can fly , make jokes , roll their eyes , and exact vengeance from the evil-doers . they usually look pretty funny flying around , but the effects are not bad . for some reason , one of the kids always has a switch-blade in his mouth , and he uses it to slice people ' s necks and to cut holes into tires . this movie is weird and funny , but only the first time you see it . meg foster is in this movie and she looks fatter than rosie o ' donnell and meg plays a masculine leader of the local gangsters . strange movie .  lone star productions sure churned them out in the 1930 ' s , and " star packer " has the feel of one of the more rushed ones . john wayne is u . s . marshal john travers , investigating a crooked hoodlum known only as " the shadow " , responsible for stealing cattle , stage holdups and the like , and giving orders from behind the door of a phony wall safe . yakima canutt is travers ' trusty indian sidekick , appropriately named as . . . well , " yak " . 

early on , we find out that cattlemens union head matt matlock ( george pre-gabby hayes ) is really the shadow ; the dead giveaway is when he offers to buy out his ( supposed ) niece anita ' s half of the matlock ranch , since " this is no place for a girl " . as anita , verna hillie doesn ' t have much to do in the film , although in a comic moment , she gets to use a six shooter to blast the butt of one of the villains in a night time scare raid . 

there are a few curiosities in the film - for one , wayne ' s character alternately rides a white horse and a dark horse in the first half of the film . in what could have been a neat device , a hollowed out tree stump used by a henchman is located right in the middle of the street . and finally , the movie doesn ' t truly live up to it ' s name , as sheriff travers never wears a badge throughout the film , that is , a star packer without a star . 

the horse chases , the runaway stage scenes , the stagecoach off the cliff ( another curiosity , the horses conveniently get loose from the stage ) are all pretty standard stuff . but john wayne fans will want to see this one for the charisma he displayed early on in his career . for those more critical , the white kerchiefs worn around the forehead by the good guy posse could only mean that they all had a headache .  what you need in the run up to ' what you need ' , every episode since ' the lonely ' had been a winner to some extent . this episode is the first major failure since ' escape clause ' . the serling script is again based on someone else ' s materiel , a short story by lewis padgett . as with ' and when the sky was opened ' , serling altered the content significantly , removing a scientist and his machine and inserting an elderly peddler . 

 ' what you need ' works best when it is being sweet . the opening half , in which the peddler provides customers in a bar with objects they will need in the near future , has a gentle charm about it that may have worn thin throughout an entire episode but works well in the time frame it is allotted . sadly , the main plot which it sets up is full of gaping holes . the minute steve cochran ' s performance as a two-bit thug becomes the main focus the episode falls apart . cochran ' s part is an underwritten stereotype and his flat performance highlights this flaw . his exploitation of the old peddler is dull and predictable and the revelation that he will murder the old man is totally unconvincing , making the whole slippery shoes scene seem completely false . ernest truex is good as the peddler , bringing a magical , mysterious but warm edge to the character , but he ' s not good enough to help the floundering script . 

to make matters worse , the weak script is also full of inconsistencies . for instance , we learn that the peddler ' s power to provide people with what they need stems from an ability to see into the future . so how exactly does this allow him to produce a pen that will magically pick winning horses . that seems like it should be a little outside his realms of power . also , for a man who can see the future , the peddler certainly acts surprised to find the thug waiting for him in his flat . there are many more holes that can be picked in ' what you need ' but it ' s hardly worth it when the episode is so thin that you can see through it anyway .  well . . . there were some great , creamy-smooth facial shots of marlene , along with her " shocking " , gender-bender outfit ( plus her not-to-be-missed " transmogrification " from ape into human being ) ; but , overall , the generally unconvincing plot and dated acting -- not to mention the less than engaging tunes coming from miss dietrich ' s " baritone " voice --did little to ensure blonde venus a permanent place in my mind ' s pantheon of memorable films . cary grant -- still in the throes of cinematic infancy -- seemed as though he was forever looking to " find himself " , while herbert marshall was probably never anything but herbert marshall from the day he was born , until the day he died . naturally , from an historical point of view , blonde venus was fun to watch , so long as one was able to put aside . . . " great expectations " .  when the legends die is a powerful , moving story of an orphaned ute indian who goes on to become tom black bull , a champion bronc rider . raised in the old ways , tom is given a white man ' s name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world . bitter about the role he has been forced into , tom finds fulfillment doing one thing , busting horses , riding them to death , in the rodeo . the movie has richard widmark in the role of red , the man who befriends tom and acts as his manager . red is a drunk who eventually dies in the story , which is about where the movie ends . the real story is completely ignored , the dark side of tom black bull who develops a reputation as a killer of horses in the rodeo arenas . oh well , you should read the book , this movie doesn ' t come close to doing the story justice .  then the second half of this movie is hard to follow . i got the first part with the spanish inquistion , but the film skipped many years forward with the french ruling spain . the movie does little to fill you in on what happened , and i don ' t remember much about it . so , the movie gets confusing then . the movie begins when ines , daughter of a rich merchant , is accused of judiasm by the church , specifically father lorenzo . she is put to the question and forced to confess . even her family ' s wealth can not buy her out of prison . her father forces lorenzo to sign a confession saying he is the offspring of a chimp , in hopes of getting ines released . all it does is give a reason for the church to condemn lorenzo , who runs off to france . 

then , the movie skips many years , and the french revolution is in full force . ines is released from prison . it was very good make up work to make natalie portman look that tore up . she finds her family dead and seeks goya for her help . she tells him she had a child in prison . goya sets up a meeting between her and lorenzo , whom is now with the french and in power . he is the father . goya sees the daughter and tells lorenzo , whom decides it ' s best to send her off to america , so no one will find out . but before his plans get carried out , the british join the spainish , and spain reclaims power and he is now the persecuted . that part is not well told in the film . it ' s like the film shows this to happen in a day . 

final verdict : the movie is good until it skips many years in time after the inquistion , then the movie expects you to understand what is going on . it just got too confusing to me then .  mild spoilers below . 

the prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when tfw was filmed . from the opening scene of european refugees to the final prediction that naziism will be the death of millions of germans , this movie is as much a propaganda film as the films made after pearl harbor . there isn ' t a lot of entertainment value here though the footage of the dust bowl is interesting to those of us who aren ' t old enough to remember it . the rest of the plot is pretty forgettable with the herr docktor coburn - with a pretty bad accent - and daughter assimilating into america with wayne ' s help . other than the dust bowl scenes , the only memorable aspect of the movie is one best viewed with hindsight . coburn ' s speech comparing naziism to a malignancy worse than cancer and describing the ( then current ) successes as a momentary outburst of energy from a patient right before death were eerily accurate and varno ' s dr . scherer played accurately to post war newsreel footage of unrepentant nazis justifying their actions . 

when viewed from a historical perspective , some aspects of tfw are interesting . if you look at it for entertainment outside of the wwii perspective , you ' d have to say this is one of wayne ' s less successful efforts .  the real surprise of this effortlessly lightweight movie is how such a top notch cast got assembled for what is nothing more than a hammy uninspiring affair . presumably it was a proverbial snowball rolling down a hill gathering pace and size and shape . one can imagine that by the time miranda richardson got contacted by her agent , the conversation went along the lines of : ' do you want to shoot a movie in dublin scripted by neil jordan ? michael caine and michael gambon are already in ! ' this is a dull ' comedy ' that sees michael caine and dylan moran try and pull off a well-planned hustle where moran must imitate a london gangland boss ( whose arrival is imminent ) to collect a sizeable sum of cash from local kingpin michael gambon . the rest is simply a forgettable romp that is thankfully over quite quickly . moran is mildly amusing in places but on this evidence is better suited to life on the small screen in hit comedies such as black books . caine is unchallenged in his role and gives a steady performance without being overstretched . one can only imagine what made him sign up for this movie - it can ' t even have been a summer in dublin given that many of the scenes look positively autumnal in the background . gambon actually steals the show , and anyone who has caught some of his performances in the likes of have i got news for you will know that he is a wonderfully funny man . but overall the result is disappointing , and it seems a lifetime ago that neil jordan was making quality movies of the likes of mona lisa .  what game over : kasparov and the machine does best is to delve into garry kasparov ' s psyche during the 1997 competition against ibm ' s deep blue . you see him becoming more and more paranoid , and increasingly unravelled , all because in the second game , deep blue made a move that seemed too human for his preconceived notion of chess computers . kasparov thought then , and still does , that ibm cheated . 

game over tries to seem unbiased , but it is clear that the director thinks that ibm cheated . however , they give no real evidence to support the cheating claim , only intimations that ibm ' s security surrounding the computer room was because ibm really had grandmasters hidden in there overriding the computer on certain key occasions , and kasparov ' s assertion that the computer didn ' t play like a computer usually does at one point in game two . in game two , kasparov played a game that was designed to trick the computer , attempting to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer chess programs would have taken the pawn , leading to the computer ' s eventual loss . deep blue didn ' t take the bait , and kasparov was so rattled because the computer seemed to play like a human that he didn ' t even see that he could have played deep blue to a draw and ended up resigning . that game psyched him out so much that he was unable to recover , and after playing games 3 , 4 , and 5 to draws , lost game 6 horribly . 

the question of whether ibm cheated all comes down to that single move in game two , where the deep blue made the move that any human would make but that had , up to that point , tripped up computers . joel benjamin , a chess grandmaster on ibm ' s programming team explained in the documentary that they knew that chess computers always got tripped up in that situation , and consequently spent a lot of time and effort programming deep blue so that it wouldn ' t make the mistake that other computers do . if you believe benjamin ' s assertion , then the case is clear , ibm did not cheat . unfortunately , the director quickly moved on and never mentioned ibm ' s explanation for the rest of the movie , preferring to cut between shots of the chess playing hoax of the 19th century , the turk , and shots of deep blue , hinting that deep blue was really controlled by a human as well . as someone who has an understanding of programming , the explanation by ibm makes perfect sense--if you knew what you were doing , it would not be terribly difficult to put something in the code so that , if thus and so conditions are reached , then do thus and so--in other words , tell the computer what to do if a situation like the one that kasparov created in game 2 ever happened . this isn ' t cheating , it ' s doing a good job of programming a chess computer . 

in the end , it ' s eminently clear that the director thinks that ibm cheated , and the repeated comments about ibm ' s stock rising 15 % the day that deep blue won suggest the idea that ibm cheated to pump its stock price ( kasparov even compares ibm and deep blue to enron ) . however , there is plenty of outside opinion , within both the chess and computer science communities , that deep blue won fair and square and that kasparov lost because he simply couldn ' t get past his view of computers as " dumb machines " and got psyched out by a machine that didn ' t seem so dumb after all . i just wish that the director had let us see the alternative opinion . 

 i was hoping this would be of the calibre of das boot and echo the stark realism created by acclaimed german director leni riefenstahl in her documentaries , sadly i was monumentally disappointed . the story line is implausible and defies credulity . an raf airman is shot down and somehow finds his way to a hospital in dresden . anna a nurse whose father runs the hospital and is about to become engaged to a doctor she works with falls in love with the airman and they make love . the next evening at a lavish engagement party the airman turns up disguised as a german officer and dances with anna . although well directed and acted , to me it is soap opera of the lowest order .  we sought out this hard-to-find vhs after watching two excellent merchant-ivory pictures back to back . knowing it was an instant box office failure , a failure as a rental , i thought it might be worth seeing anyway based on m-i ' s reputation . too bad ! nine years ago , it was very much a liberal agenda objective to trash the founding fathers and indeed they had some success in eradicating the founding fathers from many american classrooms including , for example , new jersey ; whose eradication of our great founders quickly ended when the washington times shone the spotlight of truth into the nj school board and their subversive deed . a small part of this was headlining the alleged sally hemmings-thomas jefferson connection , disregarding the inconvenient dna findings which failed to support the wacky left ' s agenda . never mind ! they got james ellis , an author of dubious reputation , to put it in a book , and columbia university sealed the deal by giving ellis a pulitzer . 

as to jefferson in paris , the liberal agenda spin begins in the opening scene wherein james earl jones is claiming to be the son of jefferson . the spin simply continues in flashback mode to paris . the unmistakable truth is that even if a person assumes the lie is true the hemmings allegation would be an insignificant detail into the larger matter of jefferson ' s prolonged and vital diplomatic mission to paris ( as well as to the netherlands where he secured crucial financial backing for america when our infant nation was without funds ) . 

besides the liberal spin job , there is nothing else of interest in this drab and tortuously dull movie . some of the other history is indeed accurate --- adding credence to frame the lie --- but this movie takes one of the most interesting moments in american history and reduces it to a remedy for insomnia . 

please do not ask me why liberals set out to trash the founding fathers , because i don ' t waste time explaining the acts of such people . don ' t ask them either ; they usually respond to such questions with the same answer : " shut up ! "  wow , another kevin costner hero movie . postman , tin cup , waterworld , bodyguard , wyatt earp , robin hood , even that baseball movie . seems like he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention . the characters are almost always the same . . . the heroics , the flaws , the greatness , the fall , the redemption . yup , within the 1st 5 minutes of the movie , we ' re all supposed to be in awe of his character , and it builds up more and more from there . 

and this time the story . . . story ? . . . is just a collage of different movies . you don ' t need a spoiler ; you ' ve seen this movie several times , though it had different titles . you ' ll know what will happen way before it happens . this is like mixing an officer and a gentleman with backdraft , but both are easily better movies . watch backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be made . . . and also to see how an good but slightly underrated actor , russell , plays the hero .  the only good thing about persepolis is the shadows created in the german expressionism-style of animation and a hint of history . this movie bored me . it was about a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then goes back to her roots . here she finds great discontentment once again and finally leaves for final to let everyone else in her country figure out the situation and what they will do now that she is not there to support them . it comes to no conclusion and leaves us with a feeling that this woman has no loyalties . mind you , she is torn between cultures and doesn ' t have enough of a background it seems to figure what is important and real . she is listening to ever-so-many voices and will most likely end up a world citizen of some kind than one with any ties to her native culture of iran . the only thing i received from this movie was angst .  spoilers abound . you have been warned . 

i was thoroughly disappointed , this being my first street fighter movie i have seen ( i dare not go near the 1994 joke yet ) . very little grabs your attention in street fighter zero ( alpha ) as opposed to most japanimation . the fights are hilariously done over board ( shun versus zangief was a laugher ) and the dramatization is far too moody especially toward the end when ryu has to control everything in his fight against his brother . 

the main street fighter , ryu , has been weakening to a far darker version inside of himself . frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother ! a shady street fighting tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter ' s mind . 

what is with the artist ' s drawing of feet ? any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive . the story ' s soft nature makes the street fighter genre far too intelligent , and places far more emphasis on a character ( shun ) , that is not even a fighter in the video game ! a character study on more than just the core stars of the original street fighter is completely ignored . how many times did you catch rolento ? adon ? guy ? street fighter zero lacks the imagination of the video game .  this is a very low budget film , set in one location in a valley shielded by the effects of radiation . the cast , an older man and daughter , a handsome visitor , a couple ( a tough buy and gal ) , a drifter , a donkey and a radiation affected man , interact during the after effects of a nuclear blast . added to this is an entity watching the women take a bath . 

they all have guns , some of them get shot , some of them are told to have children , others are murdered and others just drift away and , well this is the movie . harvey cormann ' s first film , it shows a certain simplicity in movie making . to avoid expensive sets , actors go through curtains to enter and exit the house ( ie the studio ) . the location shots filmed in the hills near hollywood are the backdrop . 

i would not say this is worth going out of your way to see , but interesting to see how movies with human subjects were made in the 50s .  the plot here is simple . country boy , lem ( farrell ) goes to the city to sell the wheat crop , falls in love with a waitress , kate ( duncan ) and marries her , bringing her home to a hostile father and a group of woman-hungry reapers . there are shades of they knew what they wanted and mice and men here . the courtship , taking place in two lengthy sequences set in the restaurant , consume the first half hour and are lethargically paced . lem is so weak he allows his father to mistreat his wife , who is propositioned by mac ( richard alexander ) , one of the reapers , to come away with him . duncan and alexander are the only good things in this tedious potboiler , which lacks the insights and the cinematic beauty we expect from murnau . farrell ' s character has no backbone so we wind up rooting for a " real man " ( mac ) to take kate away from it all . with audience sympathy skewed , the film loses its narrative progression . the father ' s conversion at film ' s end is unrealistic and unbelievable , making for a contrived denouement . this film is for fans of the stars and the director only - general audiences need not bother .  meet cosmo ( jason priestley ) , a nerdy young bookie content with his boring life crunching numbers for the mob and living in a stark basement apartment at a senior citizens center . his only recreation is watching tv and the occasional tryst with his quirky prostitute pal , honey ( janeane garofalo ) . but one day all this changes , when the mob boss is killed and the well-regarded cosmo is selected by the smooth and persuasive new chief , gordon ( robert loggia ) , to become a full-fledged hit man . it ' s an offer the reluctant cosmo cannot-repeat , cannot-refuse , and he quickly trades in his mundane , solitary existence for a crash course in revenge under the tutelage of veteran mobster steve ( peter riegert ) , a relaxed , suburban bon vivant who relishes the job ' s maximum pay and minimum hours . in no time , cosmo surprises both himself and mentor steve by displaying an absolutely uncanny aptitude for the work . though he ' s never touched a gun before , cosmo proves to be both a crack marksman and , after an initial wave of moral hesitancy , a cool , detached killer . soon , cosmo is dispatching deadbeat clients with speed and style and his natural flair with a gun quickly establishes him as an invaluable addition to gordon ' s mob . 

reality gets in the way though , when one night , while being massaged by honey , cosmo admits feeling a bit uptight and she recommends he try yoga to relax . cosmo takes her advice and joins a nearby yoga class taught by a beautiful young woman named jasmine ( kimberly williams ) . cosmo is instantly taken with the kind and gentle jasmine , who soon becomes drawn to cosmo . now if she can just get rid of her pesky , abusive boyfriend , randy ( josh charles ) , maybe she and cosmo can actually start something . cosmo , using some of the " skills " of his new trade , eventually persuades randy to disappear and his relationship with jasmine takes off . 

writer / director m . wallace wolodarksy , a two-time emmy award-winner for his work on " the tracy ullman show " and " the simpsons " , has fashioned a script fusing his three genre loves : " i like comedies , gangster movies and romances , " explained wolodarsky , " so i essentially smashed together all three to create this film . " but what he ' s come up with is a film so disjointed and improbable that it looks just like a very long sketch on saturday night live . it ' s monotonous tone doesn ' t so much match it ' s droll sense of humor , as underline the fact that a lot of money was spent on a vehicle for jason priestly to blithely shatter his nice guy image , which doesn ' t even fully succeed because he plays his character not as a nerd , but as a laconic zombie . a nerd may be naive , but a nerd has passion . passion for inwardly directed things . but priestly plays his character as mentally deficient , almost the anti-forrest gump . unfortunately , " coldblooded " doesn ' t have the sense of scope to actually be the anti-forrest gump . 

peter riegert ( local hero , animal house ) turns in a fine performance as usual , and kimberly williams does her best with what she has to work with , but janeane garofalo ( hbo ' s larry sanders show ) is practically wasted in her role as cosmo ' s friend . probably not for long , though . garofalo has all the enthusiasm and charm of an apple waiting to be picked and it ' s just a matter of time before she ' ll be given a meaty role , hopefully doing a tag team thing with marisa tomei . 

 the somewhat-belligerent brother of a suicide finds that he and his mother grieve in much the same way ( by acting out ) but that dad is morose and blaming himself . writer-director dan harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn at the seams , characters with question marks hanging over them , and then lays all the story-points out in the most obvious terms : suicide ! secrets ! gay shame ! family sickness ! ultimately aiming to wrap things up with a tidy bow , harris wants to make sure we don ' t miss a trick , initially giving us thoughtful material to ponder but then spelling everything out in an elementary , sentimental fashion . sigourney weaver ' s bemused performance as the family matriarch is dryly disengaged and she ' s a joy--that is , until harris gives her a make-over ( complete with sensible new hairstyle ) . it ' s the cinematic equivalent of a condescending pat on the head . * * from * * * *  visually , this film is interesting . light is literally thrown in a way , together with cinematography and an alluring introduction before the titles , that had my hopes up at the start , but then - a b-movie is a b-movie is a b-movie , no matter how much spectacle is seen . this film surrounds the life of albert fish , one of the most well-known serial-killers in the world . active around the start of the 20th century , fish ' s life is hastily and blurry dealt with before before he started killing children at an old age . this film is based upon two tracks : fish ' s life and that of william f . king , lead investigator of the case . what saves this film from becoming a hallmark spectacle and debacle of the usual sort , whenever films about serial killers are concerned , is the direction , which is a double-edged sword ; director scott l . flynn sheds focus enough upon the b-actors not to let their flaws shine through too much , but at the same times created a truly dull and stereotypical view of the american police through the king-angle . sure enough he dealt quite thoroughly with fish ' s meet with grace budd , the 10-year-old girl that he killed , even though i ' m not really sure if her mother was the media-crazed person that flynn really tries to emphasise that she was . i miss more psychological diving into fish , not to mention the very little time which was spent on fish ' s post-capture . all in all , interesting for those who are into serial-killers , but mostly a let-down ; however , if the director will make another film about another serial-killer , i ' d definitely see it in hopes that holes were patched-up .  roger spottiswoode isn ' t the worst director , and he did a good job on the underrated sci-fi thriller " the sixth day " ( a . k . a . " the box office downfall of mr . schwarzenegger " ) . however , " air america " has to be one of his most inept projects . 

it comes across as an amalgamation between drama , comedy and war film - it ' s not a very convincing mix . in fact , i found it to be overbearing . 

robert downey , jr . ( during his heyday ) stars as a pilot recruited into a top secret cia organization operating during laos in the vietnam era . mel gibson plays his co-pilot and he stumbles upon the knowledge that they ' re trafficking drugs , and what not . 

the movie was hyped on release because it starred two famous faces and aerosmith had re-recorded the doors classic " love me two times " for the soundtrack . 

the redo of the song is pretty poor , which suits the film .  we ' ve all got to start somewhere , it was in films like escape in the fog that somebody like budd boetticher could learn his trade before turning out good films . in fact the film was dated before it even hit the movie going public on june 25 , 1945 . 

the war on europe was over for almost two months , of course not even harry cohn could control the events of history . so i ' m wondering why even back then the public didn ' t question why a nazi spy ring was helping out the japanese . another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the fbi had nothing to do with the pacific or asian theater . the cloak and dagger stuff was the territory of the oss in that part of the world . 

when you ' re an fbi man like william wright it sure good to have a psychic girl friend like nina foch . he ' s about to go on a mission to the orient to deliver the names of key underground leaders to start a general uprising in china against the japanese occupation . germans who ' ve been bugging otto kruger ' s house learn of this and the whole movie is spent with these guys who ' ve already lost the war trying to help their allies . who , by the way , they refer to as ' japs ' . when foch is sideswiped by a speeding car and knocked unconscious she dreams about wright ' s danger and sees what is about to happen to him on the golden gate bridge . she goes there and foils the plot . 

all the stuff you ' d expect from a nice noir film is there , the foggy atmosphere of san francisco , the dimly lit sets , budd boetticher tried his best as did the cast . but they just weren ' t convincing , probably because they didn ' t believe this claptrap themselves . 

it ' s possible , but not likely that nina foch ' s dream and its psychic consequences might have been more developed and the developments were left on the cutting room floor . i think it was just a lousy screenplay . 

and budd and harry cohn at columbia pictures had the fast moving events of history going against them here .  a good ol ' boy film is almost required to have moonshine , car chases , a storyline that has a vague resemblance to " plot " and at least one very pretty country gal , barefoot with short shorts and a low top . the pretty gal is here ( dressed in designer jeans ) -- but the redneck prerequisites stop there . jimmy dean is a natural as a sausage spokesman but as a tough guy former sheriff , he comes up way short . big john is big , but he isn ' t convincing with the " bad " part of his moniker . bug-eyed jack elam is a hoot as always and bo hopkins has been playing this same part for decades ; ned beatty also does his part in a small role . . . but there is no story . it smells more like an episode of in the heat of the night than a feature film . cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment . perhaps the most glaring problem with this movie is charlie daniels singing the theme . you know the one ; it was made famous by . . . jimmy dean .   " stick around " is one of the brief series of films that paired bobby ray with oliver ' babe ' hardy before hardy ' s immortal teaming with stan laurel . several critics have suggested that ray and hardy -- the gormless little man and the overbearing big man -- were a prototype for laurel and hardy , but that simply isn ' t true . ray and hardy play off each other well , but really aren ' t a team ; in each of these films , ray has more footage and is clearly meant to be the hero , while hardy bullies him in a manner very much unlike his later " ollie " character ' s treatment of " stanley " . it ' s very clear that the relationship between little bobby and big babe was inspired by earlier chaplin films , in which the little tramp was bullied by huge mack swain or burly eric campbell . 

however , in " stick around " , hardy sports a bowler hat that ' s identical to his later " ollie " titfer ( although with a fuller moustache ) , and he and bobby -- after spending most of this movie as adversaries -- end up as drunken comrades . 

bobby is a paperhanger for the firm of matz and blatz , with hardy as his boss . when the tardy bobby tries to pretend he showed up promptly , there ' s some clever physical business between the two men that reminds me of a routine performed by roscoe arbuckle and buster keaton in ' the garage ' . a bit later , bobby ray -- whose brief acting career never firmly developed a screen persona -- performs an " impossible " gag that would have been inappropriate for stan laurel , when he pulls a long stepladder out of a much smaller toolkit . 

the paperhangers go to work in a sanitarium , and there are the usual unrealistic depictions of mental illness : one resident insists on sitting on a piece of toast because he thinks he ' s a poached egg ! there are also some howlingly racist ( and tastelessly unfunny ) gags involving a black man who obligingly lets the inmates crack open walnuts on top of his head . when he sees a * picture * of a lion -- not even a photograph , mind you -- he goes all cowardly as if it were an actual wild animal . 

 " stick around " is fairly dire . most of the pantomime and acting is much broader than it needs to be for a slapstick comedy ; even hardy , already a very subtle actor by 1925 , pongs badly with his over-acting here . there are several bad examples of shot-matching . i was impressed with one unusual camera set-up , when a fat pedestrian ' s face is dirtied and we see a close-up of his reflection in a hand mirror , rather than his actual face . 

spoilers coming . during their brief pairing , hardy typically played ray ' s boss or adversary or both ; here , for once , they end up as pals . it ' s a nice ending , but it doesn ' t make up for what ' s really a poor film . my rating for this one is only 4 out of 10 .  two years after this short , the last " our gang " short was made . after seeing this , you wonder how it even lasted that much longer . the quality of " our gang " nosedived soon after moving from hal roach to mgm , and this short is a perfect example . the gags are all very unfunny and froggy ' s last line of this being the happiest day of his life paints a bad picture in your mind of what it ' s like for him the rest of the time . a very poor example of film making .  perhaps the director was trying for another pirate ( good garland and kelly musical ) -- but this lame musical epoch falls flat . sinatra and kathryn graysons voices do not blend well -- and their chemistry together lacks spark . the premise of sinatra as a sweet guy who tries to impersonate his late " bandito " father is okay , but he seems awkward in the role . what ' s amazing and wonderful here , is how sinatra can take a rather insipid song and make it seem special -- his phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to hear it again . when grayson sings the same songs it ' s hard to believe she ' s not singing something entirely different and not nearly as interesting . she has her big moment with " love is where you find it " which suits her perfectly and shows off her abilities . the photography is lucious and both stars look appealing as do the costumes and sets . co-stars mildred natwick and j . carroll nash put lots of energy into making the impossible work . aside from sinatra ' s singing there is a strange menage-a-tois dance with ricardo montalban , cyd charisse and ann miller . it ' s fascinating and weird . montalban and charisse were a wonderful dancing team and this number is a real oddity .  a coming-of-age story about a teenager rebelling against the church and her minister father in a small norwegian village . the countryside setting is picturesque but the story is rather pretentious and plodding , with much of the film devoted to quoting scriptures . it ' s like watching a religious propaganda movie . theisen , who has made only one other movie , is pretty good as the sensitive young protagonist , as are sundquist as her strict father and riise as a woman that theisen is fascinated with . the film aims to be fresh and charming but feels rather stale and tired . director and co-writer nesheim , who has worked mostly in tv , is not up to the task .  this movie reminds me of harry potter - not the style but the marketing strategy . there may be part 2 , part three . . . until one day the product life cycle finishs , of course on the condition that the part one has a commercial success . so many things seems to be hidden and thus the story looks quite incomplete . the action design is boring . set design is ok but not fine . perhaps edison chen would be a big star one day . he really looks charming even on big screen . the most impressive is still anthony wong . 4 / 10

 given this film ' s incredible reviews i was expecting something truly exceptional . it certainly starts well with witty and sharp dialogue , and a fine cast in place . a series of robert altman-style interwoven stories reel the viewer in with some compelling scenes . i found it gripping entertainment right through to the second half of the film when sadly , it collapses like a pack of cards . a series of ludicrous coincidences and right-on messages stack up until i ' m left deeply disappointed and wondering what all the fuss is about . paul haggis has tackled the subject of race in la , and that alone seems to have elevated this movie to a new level of interest . given that most of the academy voters live in la and have experienced racism to some extent , this film is sure to have an impact on them . that means the oscar for best picture will go to the race movie or the gay movie . let ' s hope it is the latter , because brokeback mountain is a bona fide masterpiece that deserves recognition .  i am a fan of good historical fiction , and was thrilled at the thought that someone would take a well written book series and film it . writing scripts is not like writing regular fiction , but when you have a book you are adapting , it would be nice to actually follow the plot line . 

the portrayals of the vespasians ( the actual emperor , and his 2 sons titus and domitian ) was horrid . they acted like a cookie cutter caligula , and were the ' bad guys ' in this adaptation . there was a scene with titus dispensing justice as if he was caligula ( from the movie of the same name . ) the way the vespasianii are portrayed in the books mostly follow the reports of historians writing in that time period - they were fair , and sane , not tainted by the imperial claudian insanity . 

helena ( the love interest of marcus didius falco ) gives as her reason for divorcing pertinax ( one of the traitors referenced in the title ) was that he was a traitor , yet in the books it was because he ignored her and she felt that she would be better off marrying someone who valued her as a person . 

marcus in the movie gets a slave named justus , yet in the books he could barely afford his apartment , let alone afford a slave . there was certainly no romantic interlude between the nonexistent slave justus and a female gladiator . . . 

on the whole , if you want good cookie cutter roman stereotypes get caligula , if you want good roman from the classical history viewpoint , get i , claudius .  on one thursday evening at 10 : 00pm , my local west coast abc affiliate aired the pilot episode of " northern exposure " . the abc network usually airs " men in trees " in that time slot but the program was preempted for a live sporting event . 

despite both shows are set in alaska and filmed on location in the pacific northwest ( exposure in washington state , trees in vancouver , bc ) , re-watching " northern exposure " ( as well as few episodes of " sex and the city " ) reminds me how disappointed i am with the poorly conceived hybrid " men in trees " . 

anne heche can be a good actress with the right material . unfortunately her role as a writer who ends up in a small town in alaska grates on my nerves . perhaps because i feel that heche is miscast , i am not convinced of her " fish-out-of-water " character . 

i also cannot help but feel that the supporting cast fits the typical quirky stereotypes . the hot-looking local , the kindly bar owner , the bush pilot , the local police officers , the dim but well-intentioned radio dj , etc . 

the only stereotype that may have been broken was teddy bear and veteran " er " actor abraham benrubi as the local bartender in love with two different women . considering that one of the executive producers is filmmaker james mangold , ( his movies " heavy " and " cop land " had lead characters who were large men ) then i am not surprised why benrubi was cast in a non-typical role . 

nonetheless , i can see why there are a lot of dedicated viewers who love " men in trees " . it fits the quirky niche for television audiences . i wished the show could find its own voice instead of borrowing ideas from better shows .  this movie should have been called " the eyes of alexander " , and they should have done away with the bogart concept altogether . the film started out with a lighthearted approach to bogart ' s legacy and some comical moments with his surgery oriented face , but after the first 15-30 minutes it morphs into a more serious thriller , where two palm size sapphires , purportedly laid as eyes into a marble headpiece of alexander the great , for him , and seen by him , right before his death . so the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size , but also because of the tie to the greatest conquerer the world has ever known . being an expert on alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction , but it makes for a good movie anyway . so the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of alexander allusions in both the foreground and background ( which i really liked ) , ending with a dated shark attack ( you couldn ' t go to a movie in ' 79- ' 80 without some shark showing up to menace the audience ) . there is a yacht named euridice ( alexander ' s father ' s young wife ) , a man named alexander , philip , cleitus ? , ( it ' s been about 5 years since i ' ve seen the film , so can ' t remember all the details ) , olympias , some street names , and many others . it was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director ( obviously an alexanderphile himself ) put in . when all is said and done , the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by . kind of a neat ending . what would have been more fun would be if they went the indiana jones way and had an action adventure . there were many , many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting , or instance , the hand-annotated ( by aristotle ) version of the iliad that alexander kept with him all his life , even on his many journeys across asia ( would be of incalculable value if found today ) . olivia hussey ( my all time favorite b-movie actress ) is killed off way too early , and should have been the main actress throughout , not the girl from the momma ' s and the poppa ' s . . . though she was herself easy on the eyes . if you can find this flick , it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see olivia hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humor bit early on , but beyond that , i ' d pass on it for something more entertaining . 

yours , nick
